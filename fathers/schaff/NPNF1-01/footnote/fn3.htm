<sup>49 </sup>"The `vail0' was an emblem of honour, used in places of worship, and subsequently in courts of law, emperors' palaces, and even private house. See Du Fresne and Hoffman <i>sub v.</i> That between the vestibule, or proscholium, and the school itself, besides being a mark of dignity, may, as St. Augustin perhaps implies, have been intended to denote the hidden mysteries taught therein, and that the mass of mankind were not fit hearers of truth."-E.B. P.</p>

<sup>50 </sup><i>Aeneìd</i>, ii. 772. </p>
<p><a name="P317_91946"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Exaggerated statements have been made as to Augustin's deficiency in the knowledge of Greek. In this place it is clear that he simply alludes to a repugnance to learn a foreign language that has often been seen in boys since his day. It would seem equally clear from Bk. vii. sec. 13 (see also De Trin. iii. sec. 1), that when he could get a translation of a Greek book, he preferred it to one in the original language. Perhaps in this, again, he is not altogether singular. It is difficult to decide the exact extent of his knowledge, but those familiar with his writings can scarcely fail to be satisfied that he had a sufficient acquaintance with the language to correct his Italic version by the Greek Testament and the LXX., and that he was quite alive to the importance of such knowledge in an interpreter of Scripture. See also <i>Con. Faust</i>, xi. 2-4; and De Doctr. Christ. ii. 11-15.</p>
<p><a name="P324_95722"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>So in Tract. II. on John, he has: "The sea has to be crossed, and dost thou despise <i>the wood?</i>" explaining it to mean the cross of Christ. And again: "Thou art not at all able to walk in the sea, be carried by a ship-be carried by <i>the wood</i>-believe on the Crucified," etc.</p>

<p><a name="P336_98421"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>Until very recently, the <i>Eunuchus</i> was recited at "the play" of at least one of our public schools. See De Civ. Dei, ii. secs. 7, 8, where Augustin again alludes to this matter.</p>

<sup>66 </sup>"To be is no other than to be one. In as far, therefore, as anything attains unity, in so far it `is.0' For unity worketh congruity and harmony, whereby things composite are in so far as they are; for things uncompounded are in themselves, because they are one; but things compounded imitate unity by the harmony of their parts, and, so far as they attain to unity, they are. Wherefore order and rule secure being, disorder tends to not being."-Aug. De Morib. Manich. c. 6. </p>
