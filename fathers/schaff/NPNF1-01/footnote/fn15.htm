<sup>124 </sup>Luke viii. 15. </p>

<sup>125 </sup>The origin of prayers for the dead dates back probably to the close of the second century. In note 1, p. 90, we have quoted from Tertullian's De Corona Militis, where he says "Oblationes pro defunctis pro natalitiis annua die facimus." In his De Monogamia, he speaks of a widow praying for her departed husband, that "he might have rest, and be a partaker in the first resurrection." From this time a <i>catena</i> of quotations from the Fathers might be given, if space permitted, showing how, beginning with early expressions of <i>hope</i> for the dead, there, in process of time, arose <i>prayers</i> even for the unregenerate, until at last there was developed purgatory on the one side, and creature-worship on the other. That Augustin did not entertain the idea of creature-worship will be seen from his Ep. to Maximus, xvii. 5. In his <i>De Dulcit. Quaest.</i> 2 (where he discusses the whole question), he concludes that prayer must not be made for all, because all have not led the same life in the flesh. Still, in his Enarr. in Ps. cviii. 17, he argues from the case of the rich man in the parable, that the departed do certainly "have a care for us." AÃ«rius, towards the close of the fourth century, objected to prayers for the dead, chiefly on the ground (see Usher's <i>Answer to a Jesuit</i>, iii. 258) of their uselessness. In the Church of England, as will be seen by reference to Keeling's <i>Liturgicae Britannicae</i>, pp. 210, 335, 339, and 341, prayers for the dead were eliminated from the second Prayer Book; and to the prudence of this step Palmer bears testimony in his <i>Origines Liturgicae</i>, iv. 10, justifying it on the ground that the retaining of these prayers implied a belief in her holding the doctrine of purgatory. Reference may be made to Epiphanius, <i>Adv. Haer.</i> 75; Bishop Bull, <i>Sermon</i> 3; and Bingham, xv. 3, secs. 15, 16, and xxiii. 3, sec. 13. </p>

<sup>16 </sup>In note 9, p. 79, we have seen how God makes man's sin its own punishment. Reference may also be made to Augustin's <i>Con. Advers. Leg. et Proph</i>. i. 14, where he argues that "the punishment of a man's disobedience is found in himself, when he in his turn cannot get obedience even from himself." And again, in his <i>De Lib. Arb</i>. v. 18, he says, God punishes by taking from him that which he does not use well, "et qui recte facere cum possit noluit amittat posse cum velit." See also Serm. clxxi. 4, and Ep. cliii. </p>

<sup>34 </sup>Anaximenes of Miletus was born about 520 B.C. According to his philosophy the air was animate, and from it, as from a first principle, all things in heaven, earth, and sea sprung, first by condensation (<font face="SPIonic">pukn/wsij</font>), and after that by a process of rarefaction (<font face="SPIonic">a0raiwsij</font>). See Ep. cxviii. 23; and Aristotle, <i>Phys</i>. iii. 4. Compare this theory and that of Epicurus (p. 100, above) with those of modern physicists; and see thereon <i>The Unseen Universe</i>, arts. 85, etc., and 117, etc. </p>
