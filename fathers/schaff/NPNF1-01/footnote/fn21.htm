<sup>57 </sup>Baxter has a noteworthy passage on our heavenly citizenship in his <i>Saints' Rest</i>: "As Moses, before he died, went up into Mount Nebo, to take a survey of the land of Canaan, so the Christian ascends the Mount of Contemplation, and by faith surveys his rest....As Daniel in his captivity daily opened his window towards Jerusalem, though far out of sight, when he went to God in his devotions, so may the believing soul, in this captivity of the flesh, look towards `Jerusalem which is above0' (Gal. iv. 26). And as Paul was to the Colossians (ii. 5) so may the believer be with the glorified spirits, `though absent in the flesh,0' yet with them `in the spirit,0' joying and beholding their heavenly `order.0' And as the lark sweetly sings while she soars on high, but is suddenly silenced when she falls to the earth, so is the frame of the soul most delightful and divine while it keeps in the views of God by contemplation. Alas, we make there too short a stay, fall down again, and lay by our music!" (Fawcett's Ed. p. 327). </p>

<sup>67 </sup>Matt. xxii. 40. For he says in his Con. Faust. xvii. 6, remarking on John i. 17, a text which he often quotes in this connection: "The law itself by being fulfilled becomes grace and truth. Grace is the fulfilment of love." And so in ibid. xix. 27 we read: "From the words, `I came not to destroy the law but to fulfil it,0' we are not to understand that Christ by His precepts filled up what was wanting in the law; but what the literal command failed in doing from the pride and disobedience of men is accomplished by grace....So, the apostle says, `faith worketh by love.0' " So, again, we read in Serm. cxxv.: "Quia venit dare caritatem, et caritas perficit legem; merito dixit non veni legem solvere sed implere." And hence in his letter to Jerome (Ep. clxvii. 19), he speaks of the "royal law" as being "the law of liberty, which is the law of love." See p. 348, note 4, above. </p>

<p><a name="P2180_851609"></a>
<sup>70 </sup>Augustin, in his letter to Jerome (Ep. clxvi. 4) on "The origin of the human soul," says: "The soul, whether it be termed material or immaterial, has a certain nature of its own, created from a substance superior to the elements of this world." And in his <i>De Gen. ad Lit.</i> vii. 10, he speaks of the soul being formed from a certain "spiritual matter," even as flesh was formed from the earth. It should be observed that at one time Augustin held to the theory that the souls of infants were created by God out of nothing at each fresh birth, and only rejected this view for that of its being generated by the parents with the body under the pressure of the Pelagian controversy. The first doctrine was generally held by the Schoolmen; and William of Conches maintained this belief on the authority of Augustin,-apparently being unaware of any modification in his opinion: "Cum Augustino," he says (Victor Cousin, <i>Ouvrages ined. d'Abelard</i>, p. 673), "credo et sentio quotidie novas animas <i>nom ex traduce</i> non ex aliqua substantia, sed <i>ex nihilo, solo jussu creatoris</i> creari." Those who held the first-named belief were called <i>Creatiani</i>; those who held the second, <i>Truduciani</i>. It may be noted as to the word "Traduciani", that Tertullian, in his De Anima, chaps. 24-27, etc., frequently uses the word <i>tradux</i> in this connection. Augustin, in his Retractations, ii. 45, refers to his letter to Jerome, and urges that if so obscure a matter is to be discussed at all, that solution only should be received: "Quae contraria non sit apertissimis rebus quas de originati peccato fides catholica novit in parvulis, nisi regenerentur in Christo, sine dubitatione damnandis." 0n Tertullian's views, see Bishop Kays, p. 178, etc. </p>
