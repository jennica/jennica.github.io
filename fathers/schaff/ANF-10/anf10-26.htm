</ul><p>The church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the church of God sojourning at Corinth, to them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.</p>
<p>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5288_756168" id="P5288_756168" name="P5288_756168">2</a></sup> which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which you consulted us; and especially to that shameful and detestable sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved, has suffered grievous injury.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5289_756643" id="P5289_756643" name="P5289_756643">3</a></sup> For who ever dwelt even for a short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly established?<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5290_756819" id="P5290_756819" name="P5290_756819">4</a></sup> Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ? Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked m the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young men to be of a sober and serious mind, ye instructed your wives to do all things With a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter II.-Praise of the Corinthians Continued.</font></p>
</ul><p>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5294_757831" id="P5294_757831" name="P5294_757831">5</a></sup> and were more willing to give than to receive.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5295_757906" id="P5295_757906" name="P5295_757906">6</a></sup> Content with the provision which God<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5296_757959" id="P5296_757959" name="P5296_757959">7</a></sup> had made for you, and carefully attending to His words, ye were inwardly filled<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5297_758181" id="P5297_758181" name="P5297_758181">8</a></sup> with His doctrine, and His sufferings were before your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious for the whole brotherhood,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5298_758734" id="P5298_758734" name="P5298_758734">9</a></sup> that the number of God's elect might be saved with mercy<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5299_758810" id="P5299_758810" name="P5299_758810">10</a></sup> and a good conscience.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5300_758855" id="P5300_758855" name="P5300_758855">11</a></sup> Ye were sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one another. Every kind of faction and schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned over the transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being "ready to every good work."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5301_759350" id="P5301_759350" name="P5301_759350">12</a></sup> Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life, ye did all things in the fear of God.

So the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years. For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5308_760331" id="P5308_760331" name="P5308_760331">16</a></sup> neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5309_760531" id="P5309_760531" name="P5309_760531">17</a></sup> but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5310_760732" id="P5310_760732" name="P5310_760732">18</a></sup> </p>

And God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field.

He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and from his father's house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God. For God said to him, "Get thee out from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into the land which I shall show thee.

But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived and said, "There came men unto thee who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands" she answered them, "The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly departed again and are gone," thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said to the men, "I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for the fear and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep ye me and the house of my father in safety." And they said to her, "It shall be as thou hast spoken to us.

Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, "Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared [our message] in His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, and acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that ion His own account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth.

The fruitful earth, according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed. The unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of the lower world, are restrained by the same laws.

The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment and health, furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men. The very smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord.

Not in every place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but in Jerusalem only. And even there they are not offered in any place, but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already mentioned. Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is agreeable to His will, are punished with death. Ye see,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5628_816346" id="P5628_816346" name="P5628_816346">222</a></sup> brethren, that the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to us, the greater also is the danger to which we are exposed.</p>

Having therefore received their orders, and being fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and established<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5636_817070" id="P5636_817070" name="P5636_817070">227</a></sup> in the word of God, with full assurance of the Holy Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at hand.

Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it was written concerning bishops and deacons.

For, when rivalry arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending among themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that glorious title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their rods, each one being inscribed with the name<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5645_818700" id="P5645_818700" name="P5645_818700">233</a></sup> of the tribe. And he took them and bound them [together], and sealed them with the rings of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of witness on the table of God. And having shut the doors of the tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto Him. And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the tribes, and opened the tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the rods. And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have blossomed, but to bear fruit upon it.<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5646_819481" id="P5646_819481" name="P5646_819481">234</a></sup> What think ye, beloved?

The righteous were indeed persecuted, but only by the wicked. They were cast into prison, but only by the unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain, but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy against them. Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them gloriously. For what shall we say, brethren?

Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were they that did such things?

Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within them.

Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5746_836225" id="P5746_836225" name="P5746_836225">298</a></sup> Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction.
