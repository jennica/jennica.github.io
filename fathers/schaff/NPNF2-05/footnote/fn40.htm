<sup>77 </sup>The following passage is anti-Calvinistic. Gregory here, as continually elsewhere, asserts the freedom of the will; and is strongly supported by Justin Martyr, i. 43: "If it has been fixed by fate that one than shall be good, and another bad, the one is not praiseworthy, the other not culpable. And again, if mankind has not power by a free choice to flee the evil and to choose the good, it is not responsible for any results, however shocking." </p>

<sup>93 </sup><i>the flesh which He has assumed, and at the same time deified.</i> "Un terme chef aux Pères du IV<sup>e</sup> siècle, de nous <i>déifier</i>" (Denis, <i>Philosophie d'Origène,</i> p. 458). This <font face="SPIonic">qeopoihsij</font><font> or </font><font face="SPIonic">qewsij</font><font> is more than a metaphor even from the first, "vere fideles vocantur </font><font face="SPIonic">qeoi</font><font>, non naturâ quidem, sed </font><font face="SPIonic">th omoiwsei</font><font>, ait Athanasius;" Casaubon, <i>In Epist. ad Eustath.</i> "We become `gods0' by grasping the Divine power and substance;" Clement, <i>Stromata,</i> iv. That the Platonists had thus used the word of </font><font face="SPIonic">to proj meizona docan anuywqen</font><font> is clear. Synesius in one of his <i>Hymns</i> says to his soul:-</font></p>
<ul><ul><p>"Soon cammingled with the Father</p>
<ul><p>Thou shalt dance a `god0' with God."</p>
</ul></ul></ul><p>just as elsewhere (<i>in Diane,</i> p. 50) he says, "it is not sufficient not to be bad; each must be even a `god.0'" Cf. also Gregory Thaum. <i>Panegyr Origenis,</i> §142 When we come to the Fathers of the 4th century and later, these words are used more especially of the <i>work of the Holy Spirit</i> upon man. Cf. Cyrill. Alex.: "If to be able to `deify0' is a greater thing than a creature can do, and if the Spirit does `deify,0' how can he be created or anything but God, seeing that he `deifies0'?" "If the Spirit is not God," says Gregory Naz., "let him first be deified, and then let him deify me his equal;" where two things are implied, 1. that the recognized work of the Holy Spirit is to `deify,0' 2. that this "deification" is <i>not</i> Godhead. It is "the comparative god-making" of Dionysius Areopag. whereby we are "partakers of the Divine nature" (2 Pet. i. 4). On the word as applied to the human nature of our Saviour Himself. Huet (<i>Origeniana,</i> ii. 3, c. 17), in discussing the statement of Origen, in his Commentary on S. Matthew (<i>Tract</i> 27), that "Christ after His resurrection `deified0' the human nature which He had taken," remarks, "If we take this word so as to make Origen mean that the Word was changed into the human nature, and that the flesh itself was changed into God and made of the same substance as the Word, he will clearly be guilty of that deadly error which Apollinaris brought into the Church (<i>i. e.</i> that the Saviour's soul is not `reasonable,0' nor His flesh human); or rather of the heresy perpetrated by some sects of the Eutychians, who asserted that the human nature was changed into the Divine after the Resurrection. But if we take him to mean that Christ's human nature, after being divested of weakness after death, assumed a <i>certain</i> Divine quality, we shall be doing Him no wrong." He then quotes a line from Gregory's <i>Iambics:</i>-</p>
<p>"The thing `deifying,0' and the thing `deified,0' are one God:"and this is said even of Christ's Incarnation; how ranch more then can it be said of His Resurrection state, as in this passage of the <i>Great Catechism?</i> Huet adds one of Origen's answers to Celsus: "His mortal body and the human soul in Him, by virtue of their junction or rather union aud blending with that (deity), assumed, we assert, qualities of the very greatest kind. ...What incredibility is there in the quality of mortality in the body of Jesus changing, when God so planned and willed it, into an ethereal and Divine" (<i>i. e.</i> the matter, as the receptacle of these qualities, remaining the same)? It is in this sense that Chrysostom can say that "Christ came to us, and took upon Him our nature and deified it;" and Augustine, "your humanity received the name of that deity" <i>(contr. Arian.).</i></p>

<sup>103 </sup>Gregory seems here to refer to Eve's eating the apple, which introdnced a moral and <i>physical</i> poison into our nature. General Gordon's thoughts ("in Palestine") took the same direction as the whole of this passage; which Fronto Ducaeus (as quoted by Krabinger) would even regard as a proof of transubstantiation.</p>

<sup>107 </sup><i>by the process of eating,</i> <font face="SPIonic">dia brwsewj</font><font>. There is very little authority for </font><font face="SPIonic">kai posewj</font><font> which follows in some Codd. If Krabinger's text is here correct, Gregory distinctly teaches a transmutation of the elements very like the later transubstantiation: he also distinctly teaches that the words of consecration effect the change. There seems no reason to doubt that the text is correct. The three Latin interpretations, "a verbo transmutatus," "statim a verbo transmutatus," "per verbum mutatus," of Hervetus, Morell, and Zinus, all point to their having found </font><font face="SPIonic">proj to swma dia tou logou metapoioumenoj</font><font> in the text: and this is the reading of Cod. Reg. (the other reading is </font><font face="SPIonic">proj to swma tou logou</font><font>). A passage from Justin Mart.,<i>Apol.</i>ii. p. 77, also supports Krabinger's text. Justin says, "so we are taught that that food which has been blessed by the pronouncing of the word that came from Him, which food by changing nouriishes our blood and flesh, is the flesh and blood of that Incarnate Jesus." As to the nature of the change (</font><font face="SPIonic">proj to swma metapoioumenoj</font><font>), another passage in Gregory (<i>In Baptism. Christi, 370</i>A) should be compared: "The bread again, was for a while common bread, but when the mystic word shall have consecrated it (</font><font face="SPIonic">ierourghoh</font><font>), it is called, <i>and moreover is,</i>the body of Chist." He says also at the end of this chapter, "He gives these gifts by virtue of the benediction through which He <i>translements</i> (</font><font face="SPIonic">metastoixeiwsaj</font><font>) the natural quality (</font><font face="SPIonic">fusin</font><font>) of these visible things to that immortal thing." Harnack does not attempt to weaken the force of these and other passages, but only points out that the idea of this change does not exactly correspond (how could it?) with the mediaeval scholastically-philosophical "transubstantiation." Gregory's belief iis that, just as the Word, when Christ was here in the flesh, rendered holy His body that assimilated bread, which still <i>in a manner remained bread,</i> so now the bread is sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer. "The idea," says Neander, "of the repetition of the consecration of the </font><font face="SPIonic">Logoj</font><font> had taken hold of his mind." The construction is </font><font face="SPIonic">proiwn (wste) genesqai eij to swma tou logou</font><font>, "eo progrediens, ut verbi corpus evadat."</font></p>
<p><a name="P4053_2695586"></a>
<sup>108 </sup><font face="SPIonic">metastoixeiwsaj</font><font>. Suicer labours, without success, to show that the word is not equivalent to <i>transelementare</i> or </font><font face="SPIonic">metousiun</font><font>, but only to <i>substantiam convertere,</i> i.e. to change by an addition of grace into another <i>mode</i> or <i>use.</i> In the passages from Eppiphanius which Suicer adduces for "figure," "mode," as a meaning of </font><font face="SPIonic">stoixeion</font><font> itself, that word means a sign of the zodiac (as in our Gregory's <i>De Anima et Resurr.,</i> it means the moon), only because the heavenly bodies are the <i>elements or first principles</i> as it were of the celestial alphabet. The other meaning of </font><font face="SPIonic">metastoixeioun</font><font> which he gives, i.e. to unteach, with a view to obscure the literal meaning here, is quite inapplicable. Gregory defines more clearly than Chrysostomom (</font><font face="SPIonic">metarruqmizesqai</font><font>), Theophylact (</font><font face="SPIonic">metapoieisqai</font><font>), and John Damascene (</font><font face="SPIonic">metaballesqai</font><font>), the change that takes place: but all go beyond Theodoret's (<i>Dial. ii</i>), "not changing nature, but adding grace to the nature," which Suicer endeavours to read into this word of Gregory's. It is to be noticed, too, that in Philo the word is used of Xerxes changing in his march one element into another, i.e. <i>earth into water,</i> not the mere use of the one into the use of the other.</font></p>

<sup>128 </sup>The section beginning here, which one Cod. (Vulcobius'), used by Hervetus, exhibits, is "evidently the addition of some blundering copyist." P. Morell considers it the portion of a preface to a treatise against Severus, bead of the heretics called Acephali. But Severus was condemned under Justinian, a.d. 536: and the Acephali themselves were no recognized party till after the Council of Ephesus (those who would follow neither S. Cyril, nor John of Damascus, in one meaning of the term, <i>i. e.</i> "headless"), or after the Council of Chalcedon (those who rejected the Henoticon of the Emperor Zeno, addressed to the orthodox and the Monophysites, in the other meaning). It is quoted by Krabinger, none of whose Codd. recognize it. </p>

<sup>2 </sup>Casaubon very strongly condemns the sentiment here expressed, as savouring more of heathenism than Christianity. He gives other instances, in which the loss from the death of friends and good men is attributed by Christian writers to the envy of a Higher Power. That the disturbed state of the Church should be attributed by Gregory Nazianzen to "Envy" is well enough, but he in the same strain as his namesake speaks thus in connection with the death of his darling brother Caesarius, and of Basil. Our Gregory uses the word also in lamenting Pulcheria and Flacilla. It only proves, however, how strong the habit still was of using heathen expressions.</p>
