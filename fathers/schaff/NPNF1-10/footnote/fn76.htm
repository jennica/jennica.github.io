<sup>1 </sup>St. Augustin, on St. John, Hom. XLIX. sec. 3, speaks of the identity as doubtful. See also Greswell, vol. ii., Diss. XVII., and vol. iii. Diss. III. It seems that the <i>occasion</i> recorded in Luke vii. 37 must have been different, whether the person were the same or not. St. Chrysostom supposes <i>two</i> unctions <i>at Bethany</i>. See note at the end of "Sermons preached at St. Savinor's Church, Leeds." [Augustin discusses the question more fully in his <i>Harmony of the Gospels</i>, see <i>Nicene Fathers</i>, vol. vi. pp. 174. He holds that there were two occasions, one named by Luke, and the other by Matthew, Mark and John. but that Mary was the person anointing on both occasions. This leads to the identification of Mary, the sister of Lazarus, with Mary Madalene. But there is no proof that Luke refers to the latter. The opinion of Chrysostom seems to be that Matthew, Mark and Luke refer to the same person, and John to another on a different occasion. But to this there are insuperable objections.-R.] </p>

<sup>3 </sup>Matt. xxvi. 8-13. [The Greek text agrees with the received with the exception of a change of order in the first clause of verse 11. In verse 12, the R. V. renders, "to prepare me for burial," and in verse 12, "bespoken of' for" be told.-R.] </p>

<sup>8 </sup>Luke xxii. 4. [The explanation is untenable. The "captains"(<font face="SPIonic">strathgoi=j</font>) were not "chiliarchs," but the officers of the temple guard; comp. Luke xxii. 52, where the same word occurs. </p>

<sup>4 </sup>[The language is somewhat obscure. But it would seem from this passage that Chrysostom believed our Lord ate the passover at the regular time. In Homily LXXXIV., he speaks of the chief priests as neglecting to eat it in their hate against our Lord, explaining in this way the difficulty arising from the statement in John xviii. 28. But in Homily LXXXIII. 3, on the Gospel of John, be presents both views, either that the whole feast is meant, or that our Lord had anticipated the observance of the Paschal supper.-R.] </p>
