<font size="3">Matthew Chapter 14, Verse 13</font></p>
<ul><p><i>"Now when Jesus had gone forth into the coasts</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5266_1628551" id="P5266_1628551" name="P5266_1628551">1</a></sup><i> of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of Man am?"</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5267_1628688" id="P5267_1628688" name="P5267_1628688">2</a></sup><i> </i></p>
</ul><p>Wherefore hath he mentioned the founder of the city? Because there was another besides, Caesarea Stratonis. But not in that, but in this doth He ask them, leading them far away from the Jews, so that being freed from all alarm, they might speak with boldness all that was in their mind.</p>
<p>And wherefore did He not ask them at once their own opinion, but that of the people? In order that when they had told the people's opinion, and then were asked, "But whom<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5270_1629328" id="P5270_1629328" name="P5270_1629328">3</a></sup> say ye that I am?" by the manner of His inquiry they might be led up to a sublimer notion, and not fall into the same low view as the multitude. Accordingly He asks them not at all in the beginning of His preaching, but when He had done many miracles, and had discoursed with them of many and high doctrines, and had afforded so many clear proofs of His Godhead, and of His unanimity with the Father, then He puts this question to them.</p>
<p>And He said not, "Whom say the Scribes and Pharisees that I am?" often as these had come unto Him, and discoursed with Him; but, "Whom do men say that I am?" inquiring after the judgment of the people, as unbiassed. For though it was far meaner than it should be, yet was it free from malice, but the other was teeming with much wickedness,</p>
<p>And signifying how earnestly He desires His Economy<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5273_1630314" id="P5273_1630314" name="P5273_1630314">4</a></sup> to be confessed, He saith, "The Son of Man;" thereby denoting His Godhead, which He doth also in many other places. For He saith, "No man hath ascended up to Heaven, but the Son of Man, which is in Heaven."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5274_1630549" id="P5274_1630549" name="P5274_1630549">5</a></sup> And again, "But when ye shall see the Son of Man ascend up, where He was before."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5275_1630650" id="P5275_1630650" name="P5275_1630650">6</a></sup> </p>
<p>Then, since they said, "Some John the Baptist, some Elias, some Jeremias, or one of the prophets,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5277_1630768" id="P5277_1630768" name="P5277_1630768">7</a></sup> and set forth their mistaken opinion, He next added, "But whom say ye that I am?"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5278_1630870" id="P5278_1630870" name="P5278_1630870">8</a></sup> calling them on by His second inquiry to entertain some higher imagination concerning Him, and indicating that their former judgment falls exceedingly short of His dignity. Wherefore He seeks for another judgment from themselves, and puts a second question, that they might not fall in with the multitude, who, because they saw His miracles greater than human, accounted Him a man indeed, but one that had appeared after a resurrection, as Herod also said.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5279_1631346" id="P5279_1631346" name="P5279_1631346">9</a></sup> But He, to lead them away from this notion, saith, "But whom say ye that I am?" that is, "ye that are with me always, and see me working miracles, and have yourselves done many mighty works by me."</p>
<p>5. What then saith the mouth of the apostles, Peter, the ever fervent, the leader of the apostolic choir?<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5281_1631668" id="P5281_1631668" name="P5281_1631668">10</a></sup> When all are asked, he answers. And whereas when He asked the opinion of the people, all replied to the question; when He asked their own, Peter springs forward, and anticipates them, and saith, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5282_1631934" id="P5282_1631934" name="P5282_1631934">11</a></sup> </p>
<p>What then saith Christ? "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5284_1632067" id="P5284_1632067" name="P5284_1632067">12</a></sup> </p>
<p>Yet surely unless he had rightly confessed Him, as begotten of the very Father Himself, this were no work of revelation; had he accounted our Lord to be one of the many, his saying was not worthy of a blessing. Since before this also they said, "Truly He is Son of God,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5286_1632359" id="P5286_1632359" name="P5286_1632359">13</a></sup> those, I mean, who were in the vessel after the tempest, which they saw, and were not blessed, although of course they spake truly. For they confessed not such a Sonship as Peter, but accounted Him to be truly Son as one of the many, and though peculiarly so beyond the many, yet not of the same substance.</p>
<p>And Nathanael too said, "Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel;" s and so far from being blessed, he is even reproved by Him, as having said what was far short of the truth. He replied at least, "Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5288_1633021" id="P5288_1633021" name="P5288_1633021">14</a></sup> </p>
<p>Why then is this man blessed? Because he acknowledged Him very Son. Wherefore you see, that while in those former instances He had said no such thing, in this case He also signifies who had revealed it. That is, lest his words might seem to the many (because he was an earnest lover of Christ) to be words of friendship and flattery, and of a disposition to show favor to Him, he brings forward the person who had made them ring<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5290_1633469" id="P5290_1633469" name="P5290_1633469">15</a></sup> in his soul; to inform thee that Peter indeed spake, but the Father suggested, and that thou mightest believe the saying to be no longer a human opinion, but a divine doctrine.</p>
<p>And wherefore doth He not Himself declare it, nor say, "I am the Christ," but by His question establish this, bringing them in to confess it? Because so to do was both more suitable to Him, yea necessary at that time, and it drew them on the more to the belief of the things that were said.</p>
<p>Seest thou how the Father reveals the Son, how the Son the Father? For "neither knoweth any man the Father," saith He, "save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5293_1634134" id="P5293_1634134" name="P5293_1634134">16</a></sup> It cannot therefore be that one should learn the Son of any other than of the Father; neither that one should learn the Father of any other than of the Son. So that even hereby, their sameness of honor and of substance is manifest.</p>
<p>3. What then saith Christ? "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5295_1634477" id="P5295_1634477" name="P5295_1634477">17</a></sup> "Thus since thou hast proclaimed my Father, I too name him that begat thee;" all but saying, "As thou art son of Jonas, even so am I of my Father." Else it were superfluous to say, "Thou art Son of Jonas;" but since he had said, "Son of God," to point out that He is so Son of God, as the other son of Jonas, of the same substance with Him that begat Him, therefore He added this, "And I say unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church;"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5296_1634972" id="P5296_1634972" name="P5296_1634972">18</a></sup> that is, on the faith of his confession. Hereby He signifies that many were now on the point of believing, and raises his spirit, and makes him a shepherd. "And the gates of hell" shall not prevail against it." "And if not against it, much more not against me. So be not troubled because thou art shortly to hear that I shall be betrayed and crucified."</p>
<p>Then He mentions also another honor. "And I also<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5298_1635414" id="P5298_1635414" name="P5298_1635414">19</a></sup> will give thee the keys of the heavens."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5299_1635476" id="P5299_1635476" name="P5299_1635476">20</a></sup> But what is this, "And I also will give thee?" "As the Father hath given thee to know me, so will I also give thee."</p>
<p>And He said not, "I will entreat the Father" (although the manifestation of His authority was great, and the largeness of the gift unspeakable), but, "I will give thee." What dost Thou give? tell me. "The keys of the heavens, that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in Heaven,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5301_1635911" id="P5301_1635911" name="P5301_1635911">21</a></sup> and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in Heaven." How then is it not "His to give to sit on His right hand, and on His left,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5302_1636174" id="P5302_1636174" name="P5302_1636174">22</a></sup> when He saith, "I will give thee"?</p>
<p>Seest thou how He, His own self, leads Peter on to high thoughts of Him, and reveals Himself, and implies that He is Son of God by these two promises? For those things which are peculiar to God alone, (both to absolve sins, and to make the church incapable of overthrow in such assailing waves, and to exhibit a man that is a fisher more solid than any rock, while all the world is at war with him), these He promises Himself to give; as the Father, speaking to Jeremiah, said, He would make him as "a brazen pillar, and as a wall;"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5304_1636974" id="P5304_1636974" name="P5304_1636974">23</a></sup> but him to one nation only, this man in every part of the world.</p>
<p>I would fain inquire then of those who desire to lessen the dignity of the Son, which manner of gifts were greater, those which the Father gave to Peter, or those which the Son gave him? For the Father gave to Peter the revelation of the Son; but the Son gave him to sow that of the Father and that of Himself in every part of the world; and to a mortal man He entrusted the authority over all things in Heaven, giving him the keys; who extended the church to every part of the world, and declared it to be stronger than heaven. "For heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word shall not pass away."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5306_1637666" id="P5306_1637666" name="P5306_1637666">24</a></sup> How then is He less, who hath given such gifts, hath effected such things?</p>
<p>And these things I say, not dividing the works of Father and Son ("for all things are made by Him, and without Him was nothing made which was made"):<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5308_1637910" id="P5308_1637910" name="P5308_1637910">25</a></sup> but bridling the shameless tongue of them that dare so to speak.</p>
<p>But see, throughout all, His authority: "I say unto thee, Thou art Peter; I will build the Church; I will give thee the keys of Heaven."</p>
<p>4. And then, when He had so said, "He charged them that they should tell no man that He was the Christ."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5311_1638234" id="P5311_1638234" name="P5311_1638234">26</a></sup> </p>
<p>And why did He charge them? That when the things which offend are taken out of the way, and the cross is accomplished, and the rest of His sufferings fulfilled, and when there is nothing any more to interrupt and disturb the faith of the people in Him, the right opinion concerning Him may be engraven pure and immovable in the mind of the hearers. For, in truth, His power had not yet clearly shone forth. Accordingly it was His will then to be preached by them, when both the plain truth of the facts, and the power of His deeds were pleading in support of the assertions of the apostles. For it was by no means the same thing to see Him in Palestine, now working miracles, and now insulted and persecuted (and especially when the very cross was presently to follow the miracles that were happening); and to behold him everywhere in the world, adored and believed, and no more suffering anything, such as He had suffered.</p>
<p>Therefore He bids them "tell no man." For that which hath been once rooted and then plucked up, would hardly, if planted, again be retained among the many; but that which, once fixed, hath remained immovable, and hath suffered injury from no quarter, easily mounts up, and advances to a greater growth.</p>
<p>And if they who had enjoyed the benefit of many miracles, and had had part in so many unutterable mysteries, were offended by the mere hearing of it; or rather not these only, but even the leader<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5315_1639677" id="P5315_1639677" name="P5315_1639677">27</a></sup> of them all, Peter; consider what it was likely the common sort should feel, being first told that He is the Son of God, then seeing Him even crucified and spit upon, and that without knowledge of the secret of those mysteries, or participation in the gift of the Holy Ghost. For if to His disciples He said, "I have many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now;"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5316_1640123" id="P5316_1640123" name="P5316_1640123">28</a></sup> much more would the rest of the people have utterly failed, had the chiefest of these mysteries been revealed to them before the proper time. Accordingly He forbids them to tell.</p>
<p>And to instruct thee how great a thing it was, their afterwards learning His doctrine complete, when the things that offend had passed by; learn it from this same leader of theirs. For this very Peter, he who after so many miracles proved so weak as even to deny Him, and to be in fear of a mean damsel; after the cross had come forth, and he had received the certain proofs of the resurrection, and there was nothing more to offend and trouble him, retained the teaching of the Spirit so immovable, that more vehemently than a lion he sprang upon the people of the Jews, for all the dangers and innumerable deaths which were threatened.</p>
<p>With reason then did He bid them not tell the many before the crucifixion, since not even to them that were to teach did He venture to commit all before the crucifixion. "For I have many things to say unto you," saith He, "but ye cannot bear them now."</p>
<p>And of the things too that He did say, they do not understand many, which He did not make plain before the crucifixion. At least when He was risen from the dead, then and not before they knew some of His sayings.</p>
<p>5. "From that time forth began He to show unto them that He must suffer.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5321_1641586" id="P5321_1641586" name="P5321_1641586">29</a></sup> From that time." What time? When He had fixed the doctrine in them; when He had brought in the beginning of the Gentiles.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5322_1641729" id="P5322_1641729" name="P5322_1641729">30</a></sup> </p>
<p>But not even so did they understand what He said. "For the saying," it is said, "was hid from them; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5324_1641852" id="P5324_1641852" name="P5324_1641852">31</a></sup> and they were as in a kind of perplexity, not knowing that He must rise again. Therefore He rather dwells on the difficulties, and enlarges His discourse, that He may open their mind, and they may understand what it can be that He speaks of.</p>
<p>"But they understood not, but the saying was hid from them, and they feared to ask this; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5326_1642205" id="P5326_1642205" name="P5326_1642205">32</a></sup> not whether He should die, but how, and in what manner, and what this mystery could be. For they did not even know what was this same rising again, and supposed it much better not to die. Therefore, the rest being troubled and in perplexity, Peter again, in his ardor, alone ventures to discourse of these things; and not even he openly, but when he had taken Him apart; that is, having separated himself from the rest of the disciples; and he saith, "Be it far from Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto Thee."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5327_1642736" id="P5327_1642736" name="P5327_1642736">33</a></sup> What ever is this? He that obtained a revelation, he that was blessed, hath he so soon fallen away, and suffered overthrow, so as to fear His passion? And what marvel, that one who had not on these points received any revelation, should have that feeling? Yea, to inform thee that not of himself did he speak those other things either, see in these matters that were not revealed to him how he is confounded and overthrown, and being told ten thousand times, knows not what the saying can mean.</p>
<p>For that He is Son of God he had learnt, but what the mystery of the cross and of the resurrection might be, was not yet manifest to him: for "the saying," it is said, "was hid from them."</p>
<p>Seest thou that with just cause He bade them not declare it to the rest? For if it so confounded them, who must needs be made aware of it, what would not all others have felt?</p>
<p>6. He however, to signify that He is far from coming to the passion against His will, both rebuked Peter, and called him Satan.</p>
<p>Let them hear, as many as are ashamed of the suffering of the cross of Christ. For if the chief apostle, even before he had learnt all distinctly, was called Satan for feeling this, what excuse can they have, who after so abundant proof deny His economy? I say., when he who had been so blessed, who made such a confession, has such words addressed to him; consider what they will suffer, who after all this deny the mystery of the cross.</p>
<p>And He said not, "Satan spake by thee," but, "Get thee behind me, Satan."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5333_1644266" id="P5333_1644266" name="P5333_1644266">34</a></sup> For indeed it was a desire of the adversary that Christ should not suffer. Therefore with such great severity did He rebuke him, as knowing that both he and the rest are especially afraid of this, and will not easily receive it.</p>
<p>Therefore He also reveals the thoughts of his mind, saying, "Thou savorest<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5335_1644592" id="P5335_1644592" name="P5335_1644592">35</a></sup> not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."</p>
<p>But what means, "Thou savorest<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5337_1644699" id="P5337_1644699" name="P5337_1644699">36</a></sup> not the things that be of God, but those that be of men"? Peter examining the matter by human and earthly reasoning, accounted it disgraceful to Him and an unmeet thing. Touching him therefore sharply,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5338_1644964" id="P5338_1644964" name="P5338_1644964">37</a></sup> He saith, "My passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding, thou wouldest know that this of all things most becometh me. For thou indeed supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I say unto thee, that for me not to suffer is of the devil's mind;" by the contrary statements repressing his alarm.</p>
<p>Thus as John, accounting it unworthy of Christ to be baptized by him, was persuaded of Christ to baptize Him, He saying, "Thus it becometh us,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5340_1645585" id="P5340_1645585" name="P5340_1645585">38</a></sup> and this same Peter too, forbidding Him to wash his feet, by the words, "Thou hast no part with me, unless I wash thy feet; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5341_1645737" id="P5341_1645737" name="P5341_1645737">39</a></sup> even so here too He restrained him by the mention of the opposite, and by the severity of the reproof repressed his fear of suffering.</p>
<p>7. Let no man therefore be ashamed of the honored symbols of our salvation, and of the chiefest of all good things, whereby we even live, and whereby we are; but as a crown, so let us bear about the cross of Christ. Yea, for by it all things are wrought, that are wrought among us. Whether one is to be new-born, the cross is there; or to be nourished with that mystical food, or to be ordained, or to do anything else, everywhere our symbol of victory is present. Therefore both on house, and walls, and windows, and upon our forehead, and upon our mind, we inscribe it with much care.</p>
<p>For of the salvation wrought for us, and of our common freedom, and of the goodness of our Lord, this is the sign. "For as a sheep was He led to the slaughter."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5344_1646641" id="P5344_1646641" name="P5344_1646641">40</a></sup> When therefore thou signest thyself, think of the purpose of the cross, and quench anger, and all the other passions. When thou signest thyself, fill thy forehead with all courage, make thy soul free. And ye know assuredly what are the things that give freedom. Wherefore also Paul leading us there, I mean unto the freedom that beseems us, did on this wise lead us unto it, having reminded us of the cross and blood of our Lord. "For ye are bought," saith he, "with a price; be not ye the servants of men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5345_1647171" id="P5345_1647171" name="P5345_1647171">41</a></sup> Consider, saith he, the price that hath been paid for thee, and thou wilt be a slave to no man; by the price meaning the cross.</p>
<p>Since not merely by the fingers ought one to engrave it, but before this by the purpose of the heart with much faith. And if in this way thou hast marked it on thy face, none of the unclean spirits will be able to stand near thee, seeing the blade whereby he received his wound, seeing the sword which gave him his mortal stroke. For if we, on seeing the places in which the criminals are beheaded, shudder; think what the devil must endure, seeing the weapon, whereby Christ put an end to all his power, and cut off the head of the dragon.</p>
<p>Be not ashamed then of so great a blessing, lest Christ be ashamed of thee, when He comes with His glory, and the sign appears before Him, shining beyond the very sunbeam.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5348_1648030" id="P5348_1648030" name="P5348_1648030">42</a></sup> For indeed the cross cometh then, uttering a voice by its appearance, and pleading with the whole world for our Lord, and signifying that no part hath failed of what pertained to Him.</p>
<p>This sign, both in the days of our forefathers and now, hath opened doors that were shut up;<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5350_1648328" id="P5350_1648328" name="P5350_1648328">43</a></sup> this hath quenched poisonous drugs;<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5351_1648428" id="P5351_1648428" name="P5351_1648428">44</a></sup> this hath taken away the power of hemlock:, this hath healed bites of venomous beasts. For if it opened the gates of hell, and threw wide the archways of Heaven, and made a new entrance into Paradise, and cut away the nerves of the devil; what marvel, if it prevailed over poisonous drugs, and venomous beasts, and all other such things.</p>
<p>This therefore do thou engrave upon thy mind, and embrace the salvation of our souls. For this cross saved and converted the world, drove away error, brought back truth, made earth Heaven, fashioned men into angels. Because of this, the devils are no longer terrible, but contemptible; neither is death, death, but a sleep; because of this, all that warreth against us is cast to the ground, and trodden under foot.</p>
<p>If any one therefore say to thee, Dost thou worship the crucified? say, with your voice all joy, and your countenance gladdened, "I do both worship Him, and will never cease to worship." And if he laugh, weep for him, because he is mad. Thank the Lord, that He hath bestowed on us such benefits, as one cannot so much as learn without His revelation from above. Why, this is the very reason of his laughing, that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5354_1649786" id="P5354_1649786" name="P5354_1649786">45</a></sup> Since our children too feel this, when they see any of the great and marvellous things; and if thou bring a child into the mysteries, he will laugh. Now the heathen are like these children; or rather they are more imperfect even than these; wherefore also they are more wretched, in that not in an immature age, but when full grown, they have the feelings of babes; wherefore neither are they worthy of indulgence.</p>
<p>But let us with a clear voice, shouting both loud and high, cry out and say (and should all the heathen be present, so much the more confidently), that the cross is our glory, and 'the sum of all our blessings, and our confidence, and all our crown. I would that also with Paul I were able to say, "By which the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5356_1650644" id="P5356_1650644" name="P5356_1650644">46</a></sup> but I cannot, restrained as I am by various passions.</p>
<p>8. Wherefore I admonish both you, and surely before you myself, to be crucified to the world, and to have nothing in common with the earth, but to set your love on your country above, and the glory and the good things that come from it. For indeed we are soldiers of a heavenly King, and are clad with spiritual arms. Why then take we upon ourselves the life of traders, and mountebanks, nay rather of worms? For where the King is, there should also the soldier be. Yea, we are become soldiers, not of them that are far off, but of them that are near. For the earthly king indeed would not endure that all should be in the royal courts, and at his own side, but the King of the Heavens willeth all to be near His royal throne.</p>
<p>And how, one may say, is it possible for us, being here, to stand by that throne? Because Paul too being on earth was where the seraphim, where the cherubim are; and nearer to Christ, than these the body guards to the king. For these turn about their faces in many directions, but him nothing beguiled nor distracted, but he kept his whole mind intent upon the king. So that if we would, this is possible to us also.</p>
<p>For were He distant from us in place, thou mightest well doubt, but if He is present everywhere, to him that strives and is in earnest He is near. Wherefore also the prophet said, "I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me;<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5360_1652124" id="P5360_1652124" name="P5360_1652124">47</a></sup> " and God Himself again, "I am a God nigh at hand, and not a God afar off."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5361_1652223" id="P5361_1652223" name="P5361_1652223">48</a></sup> Then as our sins separate us from Him, so do our righteousnesses draw us nigh unto Him. "For while thou art yet speaking," it is said, "I will say, Here I am."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5362_1652402" id="P5362_1652402" name="P5362_1652402">49</a></sup> What father would ever be thus obedient to his offspring?What mother is there, so ready, and continually standing, if haply her children call her? There is not one, no father, no mother: but God stands continually waiting, if any of his servants should perchance call Him; and never, when we have called as we ought, hath He refused to hear. Therefore He saith, "While thou art yet speaking," I do not wait for thee to finish, and I straightway hearken.</p>
<p>9. Let us call Him therefore, as it is His will to be called. But what is this His will? "Loose," saith He, "every band of iniquity, unloose the twisted knots of oppressive covenants, tear in pieces every unjust contract. Break thy bread to the hungry, and bring in the poor that are cast out to thy house. If thou seest one naked, cover him, and them that belong to thy seed thou shalt not overlook. Then shall thy light break forth in the morning, and thine healings shall spring forth speedily, and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall cover thee. Then thou shalt call upon me, and I will give ear unto thee; whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5364_1653581" id="P5364_1653581" name="P5364_1653581">50</a></sup> </p>
<p>And who is able to do all this? it may be asked. Nay, who is unable, I pray thee?For which is difficult of the things I have mentioned?Which is laborious? Which not easy?</p>
<p>Why, so entirely are they not possible only, but even easy, that many have actually overshot the measure of those sayings, not only tearing in pieces unjust contracts, but even stripping themselves of all their goods; making the poor welcome not to roof and table, but even to the sweat of their body, and laboring in order to maintain them; doing good not to kinsmen only, but even to enemies.</p>
<p>But what is there at all even hard in these sayings? For neither did He say, "Pass over the mountain, go across the sea, dig through so many acres of land, abide without food, wrap thyself in sackcloth;" but, "Impart to the poor? impart of thy bread, cancel the contracts unjustly made."</p>
<p>What is more easy than this? tell me. But even if thou account it difficult, look, I pray thee, at the rewards also, and it shall be easy to thee.</p>
<p>For much as our emperors at the horse races heap together before the combatants crowns, and prizes, and garments, even so Christ also sets His rewards in the midst of His course, holding them out by the prophet's words, as it were by many hands. And the emperors, although they be ten thousand times emperors, yet as being men, and the wealth which they have in a course of spending, and their munificence of exhaustion, are ambitious of making the little appear much; wherefore also they commit each thing severally into the hand of the several attendants, and so bring it forward. But our King contrariwise, having heaped all together (because He is very rich, and doeth nothing for display), He so brings it forward, and what He so reaches out is indefinitely great, and will need many hands to hold it. And to make thee aware of this, examine each particular of it carefully.</p>
<p>"Then," saith He, "shall thy light break forth in the morning."<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5371_1655545" id="P5371_1655545" name="P5371_1655545">51</a></sup> Doth not this gift appear to thee as some one thing?But it is not one; nay, for it hath many things in it, both prizes, and crowns, and other rewards. And, if ye are minded, let us take it to pieces and show all its wealth, as it shall be possible for us to show it; only do not ye grow weary.</p>
<p>And first, let us learn the meaning of "It shall break forth." For He said not at all, "shall appear," but" shall break forth;" declaring to us its quickness and plentifulness, and how exceedingly He desires our salvation, and how the good things themselves travail to come forth, and press on; and that which would check their unspeakable force shall be nought; by all which He indicates their plentifulness, and the infinity of His abundance. But what is "the morning." It means, "not after being in life's temptations, neither after our evils have come upon us;" nay, it is quite beforehand with them. For as in our fruits, we call that early, which has shown itself before its season; so also here again, declaring its rapidity, he has spoken in this way, much as above He said, "Whilst thou art yet speaking, I will say, Lo! here I am."</p>
<p>But of what manner of light is He speaking, and what can this light be?Not this, that is sensible; but another far better, which shows us Heaven, the angels, the archangels, the cherubim, the seraphim, the thrones, the dominions, the principalities, the powers, the whole host, the royal palaces, the tabernacles. For shouldest thou be counted worthy of this light, thou shalt both see these, and be delivered from hell, and from the venomous worm, and from the gnashing of teeth, and from the bonds that cannot be broken, and from the anguish and the affliction, from the darkness that hath no light, and from being cut asunder, and from the river of fire, and from the curse, and from the abodes of sorrow; and thou shalt depart, "where sorrow and woe are fled away,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5374_1657640" id="P5374_1657640" name="P5374_1657640">52</a></sup> where great is the joy, and the peace, and the love, and the pleasure, and the mirth; where is life eternal, and unspeakable glory, and inexpressible beauty; where are eternal tabernacles, and the untold glory of the King, and those good things, "which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man;" where is the spiritual bridechamber, and the apartments of the heavens, and the virgins that bear the bright lamps, and they who have the marriage garment; where many are the possessions of our Lord, and the storehouses of the King.</p>
<p>Seest thou how great the rewards, and how many He hath set forth by one expression, and how He brought all together?</p>
<p>So also by unfolding each of the expressions that follow, we shall find our abundance great, and the ocean immense. Shall we then still delay, I beg you; and be backward to show mercy on them that are in need? Nay, I entreat, but though we must throw away all, be cast into the fire, venture against the sword, leap upon daggers, suffer what you will; let us bear all easily, that we may obtain the garment of the kingdom of Heaven, and that untold glory; which may we all attain, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and might, world without end. Amen.</p>
