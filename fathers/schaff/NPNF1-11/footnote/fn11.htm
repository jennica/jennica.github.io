<sup>4 </sup><font face="SPIonic">all ora pwj outoj ou kruptei tauta</font>. In the recapitulation (see note 3, p. 175) he says, that the death of Herod was regarded as a judgment for his having slain James and the soldiers. Here, it seems, he must have said something to that effect; then, "but observe how St. Luke does not conceal the true state of the case, viz. that he was punished not for this, but for the sin which he proceeds to mention." We have transposed the text v. 20-23. mss. and Edd. place it before <font face="SPIonic">ou uikron oude touto estin</font>, thus separating these words from their connection with the preceding question,</p>
<p><a name="P1122_1061792"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Josephus' narrative of the death of Herod (<i>Ant.</i> xix. 8, 2) is of peculiar interest here on account of its substantial agreement with that of Luke. The following points of agreement may be noted: (1) The place was Caesarea. (2) He was attacked by disease in a public assembly when, arrayed in gorgeous apparel, he received the impious flatteries of the people. (3) His disease and death were a penalty for accepting the flattery of those who accorded to him divine honors. Thus the main outlines are the same. Josephus introduces some historical notices, such as that the occasion was a celebration in honor of the Emperor Claudius, which are wanting in Luke. He also relates that after receiving the people's flattery, Herod observed an owl perced on a rope above him, which he interpreted at once as an omen of the fate which soon befell him. The supernatural element-"an angel smote him"-is wanting in Josephus. The Jewish historian is less specific in describing the disease which he speaks of as violent pains in the bowels and adds that after the attack, Herod lingered five days and died in the fifty-fourth year of his age and the seventh of his reign.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>6 </sup>At this point (ch. xiii.) begins the second part of the Book of Acts which has chiefly to do with the missionary labors of Paul. It is a reasonable supposition that the previous chapters rest upon different documents from those which follow. From chapter xvi. onward occur the so-called "we" passages (e. g. xvi. 10; xx, 6. xxi. 1; xxvii. 1) in which the writer, identifying himself with his narratives, indicates that he writes from personal knowledge and experience. The appointment of Barnabas and Saul at Antioch for missionary service, marked an epoch in the history of the early church and practically settled the questions relating to the admission of the Gentiles to the Christian community.-G. B. S.</p>

<p><a name="P1139_1083604"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>That Barnabas and Saul preached first to the Jews for the reason mentioned by Chrysostom is wholly improbable. The mission to the Gentiles entrusted to them never cancelled, in their minds, their obligation to the Jews as having in the plan of God an economic precedence. Paul not only maintained throughout his life an ardent love and longing for his people (Rom. ix.) and a confident hope of their conversion (Rom. xi.), but regarded them as still the people of privilege, on the principle: "To the Jew first, and also to the Greek?" (Rom. i. 16.) This view, together with the fact that they were Jews, constitutes a sufficient explanation for their resort to the synagogues. Additional reasons may be found in the fact that in the synagogues might be found those who were religiously inclined-of both Jewish and Gentile nationality-and who were therefore most susceptible to the influence of Christian truth, and in the fact that the freedom of speech in the synagogue-service offered the most favorable opportunity to expound the Gospel.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P1140_1085842"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Chrysostom here hints at the most probable explanation of the change of name in the Acts from Saul to Paul, although that change is not strictly simultaneous with his ordination which occurred at Antioch (v. 3), whereas the first use of the name "Paul" is in connection with his labors at Paphos, after he had preached for a time in Salamis. It seems probable that, as in so many cases, Paul, a Hellenist, had two names, in Hebrew Saul, and in Greek Paul, and that now when he enters distinctively upon his mission to the Gentiles, his Gentile name comes into exclusive use. (So, among recent critics, De Wette, Lechler, Alford, Neander, Gloag.) Other opinions are: (1) that he took the name Paul-signifying <i>little</i>-out of modesty (Augustin); (2) that he was named Paul, either by himself (Jerome), by his fellow-Christians (Meyer) or by the proconsul (Ewald), in honor of the conversion of Sergius Paulus.-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P1141_1088059"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>It can hardly be meant that the smiting of Elymas with blindness was not a judicial infliction <i>to himself;</i> but that the proconsul should see it rather on its merciful side as being only <font face="SPIonic">axri kairou</font>. The Hebraistic use of <font face="SPIonic">Xeir Kuriou</font> clearly implies a divine judgment upon Elymas as does the whole force of the narrative.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P1143_1090530"></a>
<sup>4 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Kai ta onomata de legei: epeidh prosfatwj egrafon: ora k. t. l</font>. A. b.c. N. Cat. It is not clear whether this relates to the two names, Barjesus and Elymas, (if so we might, read <font face="SPIonic">egrafen</font>, "since he wrote just before, (whose name was Barjesus, but now Elymas, for so is his name interpreted,") or to the change of the Apostle's name "Then Saul, who is also called Paul," (and then perhaps the sense of the latter clause may be, Since the change of name was recent: <font face="SPIonic">epeidh prosfatwj metegrafh</font> or the like.) The mod. text substitutes, "But he also recites the names of the cities: showing that since they had but recently received the word, there was need (for them) to be confirmed, to continue in the faith: for which reason also they frequently visited them."</p>
<p><a name="P1144_1092573"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Mod. text omits this sentence. The connection is: Paul inflicts this blindness upon him, not in vengeance, but in order to his conversion, remembering how the Lord Himself had dealt with him on the way to Damascus. But it was not here, as then-no "light shown round about him from heaven." </p>

"Down. renders it <i>non enim iroe deditus erat,</i> he was not the man for this (anger): or perhaps, For he (John) was not his, not associated by him, but by Barnabas." Ben. But the meaning should rather be, "So great a work was not for him (Mark); he was not equal to it." The connection is of this kind: "Paul knew how great grace had been bestowed on him, and on his own part he brought corresponding zeal. When Mark withdrew, Paul was not angry with him, knowing that the like grace was not bestowed on him, therefore neither could there be the like <font face="SPIonic">spoudh</font> on his part."</p>
<p><a name="P1148_1096589"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>In mss. and Edd. this portion, to the end of the paragraph, is placed after the part relating to Elymas, "He first convicted," etc. and immediately before the Morale, as if the occasion of the invective against <font face="SPIonic">filarxia</font> and <font face="SPIonic">kenodocia</font> were furnished by the conduct of the rulers of the synagogue: but see above, p. 178, in the expos. of v. 8, <font face="SPIonic">pantaxou h kenodocia kai h filarxia aitiai twn kakwn</font>, and below, the allusion to the blindness of Elymas. </p>

<sup>1 </sup>i.e. for one of the congregation to expound or preach: or perhaps rather, to preach standing, not sitting, as Christian bishops did for their sermons. We have transposed the comment to its proper place.-Mod. text adds, "Wherefore he too in accordance with this discourses to them."</p>

<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kai mhn tounantion gegonen</font>. Here also we have transposed the comment to the clause to which it belongs. In the Edd. it comes after "And with a high arm," etc. whence Ben. mistaking its reference says, "i.e., if I mistake not, God brought them out of Egypt, that he might bring them into the Landor Promise: but, for their wickedness, the contrary befell: for the greatest part of them perished in the wilderness." It plainly refers to <font face="SPIonic">uywsen</font>-i. e. how is it said, that He exalted them in Egypt, where, on the contrary, they were brought low? This is true-but He did exalt them by increasing them into a great multitude, and by the miracles which He wrought on their behalf.</p>
<p><a name="P1160_1107314"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Upon the reading of the T. R. (A. V.) the period of the Judges is here stated to have been 450 years. This agrees with the chronology of the book of Judges and of Josephus, but conflicts with 1 Kings vi. 1 where we are told that "in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, he began to build the house of the Lord." This would give but 331 years for the period of the Judges. It is the view of many critics that Paul has here followed a different chronology from that of 1 Kings which was also in use among the Jews and was followed by Josephus (so Meyer.) But if the reading of Tischendorf, Lechler, and Westcott and Hort (R. V.) is adopted-and it is sustained by A. b.c. <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p>-the difficulty, so far as Acts xiii. 21 is concerned, disappears. This reading places <font face="SPIonic">meta tauta</font> after <font face="SPIonic">wj etesin</font> sq. and inserts a period after <font face="SPIonic">penthkonta</font>. Then the translation would be, "He gave them their land for an inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years. And after these things He gave them judges," etc. On this reading the 450 years is the period of their inheritance, approximately stated, up to the time of the judges. The point from which Paul reckoned is not stated and is uncertain. This is the preferable reading and explanation.-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Kai poqen oti anesth fhsi kai martuej eisin. Eita palin apo twn grafwn</font>, followed by v. 29-37.

<p><a name="P1162_1112757"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This comment, which in the mss. and Edd. is inserted after v. 37, refers to the following verses 38, 39, i.e. to what is there said of the insufficiency of the Law for justification: we have therefore transposed it.</p>
<p><a name="P1164_1113358"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>In the old text the parts lie in the order here shown by the letters <i>a, b,</i> etc. The confusion may be explained by the scribe's copying in the wrong order from the four pages of his tablets: viz. in the first place, in the order 1, 3, 2, 4: then 2, 4, 1, 3: and lastly, 2, 1. In the modern text, a different arrangement is attempted by which all is thrown into worse confusion. Thus it was not perceived that Chrys. having in a cursory way read through v. 24-41, begins his exposition in detail with the remark of the Apostle's passing and repassing from the Old to the New Test. and <i>vice versa,</i> viz. alleging first the Promise, then John, then the Prophets, then the Apostles, then David and Isaiah, v. 24-34; then comments upon the matters contained in these and the following verses, and then as usual goes over the whole again in a second exposition. Now the renovator makes the recapitulation begin immediately after (<i>a</i>), commencing it at v. 26, and collecting the comments in this order: v. 26-32: v. 24-36: v. 17-41.</p>
<p><a name="P1165_1114494"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The transposition of the part (<i>c</i>), makes this read in the mss. and Edd. as if it were parallel with <font face="SPIonic">apo twn parontwn</font> (i.e. New Testament facts), <font face="SPIonic">apo twn Profhtwn</font> (Old Testament testimonies). </p>
<p><a name="P1166_1115678"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>It is probable that Chrys. has pointed out the true connection of thought as established by <font face="SPIonic">gar</font> (27). "The word of this salvation is sent unto you (of the dispersion) on the ground that the Jews at Jerusalem have rejected it." (So Meyer, Gloag.) The more common explanation is: The word is sent unto you because the Jews have fulfilled the prophecies which spoke of the rejection of the Messiah and have thus proved that He is the Messiah. (De Wette, Hackett, Lechler.)-G. B. S.</p>

Hence it is clear that <font face="SPIonic">toutoij</font> refers not to "the sure mercies of David," as in mss. and Edd. (end of <i>e</i>), but to the threats and terrors (end of <i>h</i>). Below, for <font face="SPIonic">all' epiteinei thn kolasin</font> the sense of <font face="SPIonic">epiteinei</font> (not as Ben. <i>minatun,</i> but <i>intentat,</i> "makes much of, aggravates, dwells upon the greatness of)", and the whole scope of the passage, require us to read <font face="SPIonic">oude</font>. Then, <font face="SPIonic">kai meterxetai</font> with the negative extending to the whole clause, "and (like Stephen) assail that which is dear to them, (viz. their preëminence as Jews,) by showing the Law on the point of being cast out:" then, <font face="SPIonic">alla</font> (so we restore for <font face="SPIonic">kai</font>) <font face="SPIonic">tw sumf. endiatr</font>., but dwells, etc. </p>

<sup>14 </sup>The reading: "In the <i>Second</i> Psalm" is the best attested and is followed by the T. R., R. V. and Wescott and Hort. <font face="SPIonic">Prwtw</font> is found in D. and is supported by the Fathers. It is the more difficult reading and for this reason is preferred by Tischendorf, Lachmann, Meyer, Afford and Gloag. If it is correct, we must suppose that what we now call the first psalm was considered introductory and that our second psalm was counted as the first. In some Heb. mss. this order actually occurs. The reading <font face="SPIonic">deuterw</font>, however, is better supported. The expression: "this day have I begotten thee" refers evidently to the resurrection of Christ. (Cf. Heb. i. 5; Rom. i. 4.) The resurrection is conceived as the solemn inauguration of Christ into his office as theocratic king represented under the figure of begetting.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>6 </sup>The expression: "As many as were ordained to eternal life believed," has been both minimized and exaggerated. Chrys. points the way to its correct interpretation in saying: "set apart for God" and adding later: "not in regard of necessity." The writer is by no means seeking to define a doctrine of the divine plan in its bearing upon human self-determination, but pointing out a historical sequence. Those who became believers were as truly so in God's plan as they are so in fact. The passage says nothing of the relation of God's ordainment to the believer's choice. It is an example of the Pauline type of thought which grounds salvation upon the eternal purpose of God. Whoever are saved in fact, were saved in God's purpose. If as matter of fact they are saved on condition of faith and not through the enforcement of a <i>decretum absolutum,</i> then it is certain that their salvation as foreseen in God's purpose does not exclude their self-determination and personal acceptance.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>8 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Anti tou, ouk esthsan mexri tou zhlou</font>. As in the mss. this clause follows that at the end of a, <i>a,</i> <font face="SPIonic">anti tou, diekomizeto</font>, the <font face="SPIonic">anti tou</font> may be only an accidental repetition. At the end of this clause, the mss. have <font face="SPIonic">ora palin pwj</font> (om. A. C. Cat.) <font face="SPIonic">diwkomenoi</font>, and then, <font face="SPIonic">pwj</font> (C. Cat.) <font face="SPIonic">etera katask</font>. (beginning of <i>c.</i>) The former clause, as the conclusion of <i>b,</i> may be completed with "they extend the preaching," or the like. But probably <font face="SPIonic">diwkomenoi</font> is due to the scribes, who seem to have understood by <font face="SPIonic">zhlou</font> here the zeal of the Apostles, not the envy of the Jews. v. 45. </p>

The sense is evidently as above, but <font face="SPIonic">anair</font>. will hardly bear this meaning, and perhaps was substituted for some other word by the copyist, who took it to mean, "They leave the Jews no excuse."-The connection is, It was not because they were less bold than when they said, "We turn unto the Gentiles," that they still went to the Jews first: but <i>ex abundanti</i> they enabled themselves to say to their brethren at Jerusalem, We did not seek the Gentiles, until repulsed by the Jews.</p>
