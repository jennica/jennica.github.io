<sup>1 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'Enteuqen</font>. If St. Chrys. is rightly reported, he means the second Epistle, which he proceeds to quote from. But that Epistle was plainly not written <font face="SPIonic">apo 'Efesou</font>. Perhaps what he said was to this effect: "At this point I suppose it was-viz. after the mission of Timothy and Erastus-that he wrote (his first Epistle) to the Corinthians from Ephesus: and in the second Epistle he alludes to the great trial which ensued in the matter of Demetrius. He had promised to come to Corinth sooner, and excuses himself on the score of the delay." But <font face="SPIonic">ta kata Dhmhtrion dihgoumenoj</font> can hardly be meant of St. Paul: it should be <font face="SPIonic">ainittomenoj</font>.</p>

But <font face="SPIonic">ieron</font> in this sense is not usual. <font face="SPIonic">#Ostrakon</font>, whatever it mean, cannot he the image of Diana, which was known to be of wood. The passage seems to be corrupt, and one might conjecture that <font face="SPIonic">ieron eteron</font> relates to "another Temple" of Diana built after the first which was burned by Herostratos, and that the name of this man is latent in the unintelligible <font face="SPIonic">htoitoostrakon</font>, and that Chrysostom's remark is this, that together with that former Temple perished the original Diopetes: so that to speak of that image as still in being was a lie (<font face="SPIonic">touto yeudoj</font>)-Mod. text "But a different <font face="SPIonic">ieron</font> was thus called <font face="SPIonic">diopetej</font>: either then the idol of Diana they called Diopetes, <font face="SPIonic">wj ek tou Dioj to ostrakon ekei nopeptwkoj</font>, and not made by man: or a different <font face="SPIonic">agalma</font> was thus called among them."-Isidore of Pelus. in the Catena: "Some say that it is spoken of the image of Diana, i.e. `(a worshipper) of the great Diana and of her <font face="SPIonic">diopetej agalma</font>:0' some that the Palladium also (is here named as <font face="SPIonic">diop</font>.), i. e. the image of Minerva, which they worshipped along with Diana." Ammonius ibid., "the <font face="SPIonic">naoj tou Dioj</font>: or the <font face="SPIonic">strogguloeidej</font>"-meaning the <font face="SPIonic">ostrakonj</font>-"or rather, which is the true explanation, this image of Diana: or the Palladium, which they thought came from Jupiter, and was not the work of men." Oecum. gives the same variety of explanations, from the Catena. The words <font face="SPIonic">touto yeudoj</font>, which in the mss. follow the text v. 36, 37, are better referred to the Diopetes, as in our translation.-Mod. text <font face="SPIonic">ara to pan yeudoj</font>: and then, "these things however he says to the people, in order that those also," etc. omitting <font face="SPIonic">de</font> preserved by the old text.</p>

<sup>11 </sup>This <i>Diapetes,</i> the image which was supposed to have fallen down from Jupiter or heaven (<font face="SPIonic">Dioj</font>-<font face="SPIonic">piptw</font>), was the image of Diana which was in the great temple at Ephesus. This was the superstitious belief of the people as is clear from the many instances in classic mythology in which statues are famed to have fallen from heaven. This image was of wood and was probably found there by the Greeks when they colonized Ionia.-G. B. S.</p>

Mod. text om. <font face="SPIonic">ouketi egxronisaj</font>, and adds: "for this is the meaning of <font face="SPIonic">eqeto</font>, and such is the force of the expression." Then: "But why he sends away T. and E., the writer does not say: but it seems to me that of this also he says, <font face="SPIonic">'En pneumati</font>. Wherefore when," etc.-The meaning is: "He sends them away on this occasion, as he did at Athens: viz. because he could no longer forbear, therefore he thought it good to be left alone." </p>

<p><a name="P1636_1579597"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>St. Chrysostom's reading of v. 4 is peculiar, but does not appear in the vv. 11. of N. T. perhaps because the Edd. of Chrys. conform it to the usual text, which is <font face="SPIonic">Qessal. de, 'Ar. kai Sek. kai Taij Derbaioj kai Timoqeoj</font>, i. e. two Thessalonians, and beside them Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, etc. But in the preceding chapter, v. 29, a Gaius was mentioned along with Aristarchus, and both as Macedonians. Hence it seems St. Chrys. read it with a stop after <font face="SPIonic">Gaioj</font>, of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus and Gaius. In his remark, be seems to be giving a reason for striking out <font face="SPIonic">kai</font> before <font face="SPIonic">Timoqeoj</font>: viz. "How does he call Timothy a Thessalonian, (as a negligent reader might suppose to be the case, viz., Of Thess. Ar. and Sec. and Gaius Derbaeus and Timothy?) He does not say this, but, of Thessalonians he mentions three, and then, of Derbe, Timothy, cf. xvi. x., whereas Gaius was not of Derbe, but of Macedonia, xix. 29." The note of Oecumen. on the passage shows that <font face="SPIonic">Derbaioj</font> was supposed by some to be a proper name: "Of the rest, he tells us what countries they were of: for Timothy he is content with the name, his personal character was distinction enough, and besides he has already told us where T. came from: viz. xvi. 1. But if <font face="SPIonic">Derbaioj</font> here is a noun of nation and not a proper name, perhaps he has here also mentioned his country."</p>
<p><a name="P1637_1581716"></a>
<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Penthkosth</font>, meaning the whole of the seven weeks. The scope of the remark is, Being met for celebration of the Holy Eucharist, which followed the Sermon, and the discourse being lengthened out until midnight, they were fasting all the time (for the Eucharist was taken fasting, see <i>Hom.</i> xxvii. <i>in</i> 1 <i>Cor.</i>): so that, though it was during the weeks after Easter, when there was no fast, and not only so, but the Lord's Day moreover, here was a fast protracted till midnight.</p>
<p><a name="P1638_1582282"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>That the religious observance of Sunday is here alluded to has been generally assumed. Taken in connection with 1 Cor. xvi. 2 and Rev. i. 10, the passage renders it highly probable that at this time (about a.d. 57) the first day of the week was regularly observed by the Christians in memory of the Lord's resurrection, although it is certain that the Jewish Christians still observed the Jewish Sabbath.-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ouk apesth</font>, so as to lose the opportunity of hearing, and forego the "breaking of bread," which was to follow the discourse. Comp. <i>Hom.</i> x. <i>in Gen. init.</i></p>
<p><a name="P1640_1585592"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The narrative requires the interpretation of Chrys. that this was a case of restoration to life, not merely of revival from suspended animation (as Olshausen, Ewald, DeWette). This is established by the fact that Eutychus is said to have seen taken up <font face="SPIonic">nekroj</font>, not <font face="SPIonic">wj nekroj</font>. Moreover to <font face="SPIonic">hrqh /ekroj</font> (v. 9) is opposed <font face="SPIonic">hgagon zwnta</font> (v. 12). He was <i>dead;</i> they brought him <i>alive.</i> It is true that the apostle says: "His life (soul) is in him," but this is said after he had fallen upon and embraced him, or this may have been said from the standpoint of his confidence of a miraculous restoration, as Jesus said of Jairus' daughter: "The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth," meaning that from his standpoint and in view of his power she still lived, although she was in reality dead.-G. B. S.</p>

The fact that the Holy Spirit is mentioned in the next verse (23) in such a way as to be distinguished apparently from "the spirit" here mentioned, has led most critics to believe that "the spirit" was Paul's own spirit (so Meyer, Lechler, Lange, DeWette, Ewald, Alford, Hackett, Gloag). <font face="SPIonic">Dedemenoj</font> should not be taken as meaning bound with chains in prospect, i. e., as seen in his spirit in advance (as Bengel, Conybeare and Howson), but rather constrained, inwardly constrained.-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>6 </sup>mss. Cat. and Edd. <font face="SPIonic">algwmen</font> "let us grieve:" but Savile, <font face="SPIonic">algw men</font>. The next clause <font face="SPIonic">all' oude hgoumai</font>, or, <font face="SPIonic">all' oude,  9Hgoumai</font>, requires something to make sense of it, as in the Translation.</p>

<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Diplh h paramuqia</font>. The meaning is, "It was his face that they would see no more: he chooses that expression by way of softening matters, implying that in spirit he would be present: and again, all ye, not they only, so that the grief was not peculiar to them:" but this being rather obscure, A. substitutes <font face="SPIonic">aqumia</font>, and mod. text <font face="SPIonic">Diplh h luph</font>, i. e. "the dejection (or, the sorrow) was twofold, both the being to see his face no more, and the, All of them."</p>

<sup>8 </sup>Neither of the two ideas which Chrys. draws from v. 25-(<i>a</i>) that though absent in body, he would be present with them in spirit; (<i>b</i>) that the "all" addressed refers to the whole company-comes naturally from the text. The apostle states his firm conviction that he shall not again visit Ephesus. Whether he ever did so or not, we do not know. The probabilities in the case would depend upon the question of a release from his Roman imprisonment. He hoped for such a release and intended to visit Colossae (Philem. 22). On the supposition of such a release and on the consequent supposition of the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral Epistles, a visit after this time to Ephesus becomes very probable. especially since we find the apostle (2 Tim. iv. 13, 2 Tim. iv. 20) at Troas and Miletus.-G.B.S.</p>
<p><a name="P1667_1616235"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>Hence it appears that St. Chrys. reads <font face="SPIonic">Kuriou</font> not <font face="SPIonic">Qeou</font> in this text, though in the citation the Scribes give it according to the other reading, <font face="SPIonic">Qeou</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1668_1616439"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>It is an interesting fact that in this passage where the reading vacillates between <font face="SPIonic">Kuriou</font> and <font face="SPIonic">qeou</font>, whale the report of the Homily has given us <font face="SPIonic">qeou</font>, the citation of the N. T. text favors the reading <font face="SPIonic">Kuriou</font>. The great majority of mss. read <font face="SPIonic">tou Kuriou</font>: <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p> and B. have <font face="SPIonic">tou qeou</font> (the usual Pauline formula). Many critics hold that <font face="SPIonic">Kur</font>. was changed to <font face="SPIonic">q</font>. in accordance with Pauline usage in the Epistles. The idea of the "blood of God" is against the reading <font face="SPIonic">qeou</font>. Modern critics are nearly equally divided. Alford, Westcott and Hort, read <font face="SPIonic">qeou</font>; Meyer, Tischendorf, <font face="SPIonic">Kuriou</font>; to us the latter seems decidedly preferable.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">#Estai xrhstoj kai megaj anhr</font>. The second epithet, being evidently unsuitable, mod. text <font face="SPIonic">xrhstoj anhr kai praoj genhsetai</font>. But perhaps <font face="SPIonic">x. a. kai. m</font>. belongs to the next sentence, as an exclamation on v. 22. "A good and great man!" and for <font face="SPIonic">malassetai: estai</font> we may read <font face="SPIonic">malaxqhsetai</font>.</p>

<sup>14 </sup>Old text: <font face="SPIonic">ina mh kataxwsh autwn thn dianoian</font>, followed by the latter part of v. 27. <font face="SPIonic">Tou anaggeilai umin k. t. l</font>. But the connection may also be, "I have not shrunk-of course in due order and proportion" (or something: of that kind) "that he may not overwhelm their minds, from declaring," etc. It might seem, however, from the comment which follows, viz <font face="SPIonic">thn peri tou parontoj pragmatoj</font>, that Chrys. is here proposing an interpretation of v. 27 different from what was implied in the first exposition, p. 269, and from that of v. 20: i. e. "painful as it is, I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the counsel of God, to wit, as touching the present matter, my separation from you, so that ye shall see my face no more." But this being very unsatisfactory, it is better to take the connection thus: Nor does he now shrink from declaring to them the whole counsel of God concerning the coming events, and their duty and responsibility therein. (We have therefore placed the mark of an hiatus before this clause.)-Mod. text substitutes, "But what is this (that he adds), `Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things.0' What then," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1674_1623440"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>The text is evidently confused or defective here. Mod. text "For that none may fancy it plea enouah for his justification, that he is a disciple while yet he does not yield, therefore having said, I take you to record, he adds, for I have not shunned," etc. </p>

<sup>16 </sup>St. Chrysostom succeeded Nectarius in the Archbishopric of Constantinople, 26th Feb. Coss. Honorius iv. and Eutychianus a.d. 398. Socrat. vi. 2.-From the following passage :t appears that these Homm. though begun after Easter, perhaps of a.d. 400, extended over a considerable period of time, not being preached every day.-Below, mod, text spoils the sense by altering <font face="SPIonic">pikrotera</font> into <font face="SPIonic">koufotera</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1677_1628358"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>Mod. text inserts a <font face="SPIonic">fhsin</font>, and makes the sentence interrogative. "And does this, you will say, profit them nothing nor shield them, that they watch for our souls? But then they watch as they that must give an account: and to some indeed this seems to be terrible." The meaning in general seems to be: "If they perish, yet surely you can comfort yourself with the thought, that you at least are pure from their blood. No, this thought avails nothing to ward off (that sorrow). "Because they watch," etc.-this seems a fearful thing. But if you be lost, it is not the thought of my accountability that gives me most concern-it is the thought of your perishing. Oh! that I might in the last day find you saved though not through me, yea, though I myself thereafter were called to account as not having done my part by you!" </p>

<sup>18 </sup><font face="SPIonic"> 9Eterwqen men oudamoqen, apo de twn genomenwn</font>) meaning perhaps, "From what has been done by us in our ministry: we will endeavor to persuade you by reminding you of all our care and pains for our salvation:") <font face="SPIonic">ta kaq' umaj panta apolusomeqa. 'Apoluesqai (egklhmata</font>), is frequent in Chrys., often confused with <font face="SPIonic">apoduesqai</font>. See Mr. Field's <i>Index and Annotat. in Hom. Matth.</i></p>
<p><a name="P1685_1633462"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>The phrase "which is able" (<font face="SPIonic">tw dunamenw</font>) may be connected with the word "God," or with "the word of His grace." As standing nearer the latter, this would be the natural construction. So our author has taken it, understanding by "the word of His grace" rather the grace itself than the doctrine concerning it. Most critics have preferred to connect the phrase with <font face="SPIonic">tw qew</font> on the ground that it is more appropriate to ascribe the giving of an inheritance among the sanctified directly to God than to His word. (So DeWette, Meyer, Alford, Gloag).-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P1686_1635153"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>By "the weak" Chrys. evidently understands the physically weak, the sick and poor (see the Recapitulation) and we think correctly as opposed to the "weak in faith." The apostle counsels labor in order to liberality toward the needy. So Olshausen, DeWette, Hackett, Gloag, Alford, <i>vs.</i> Neander, Tholuck, Lechler, Meyer.-G. B. S.</p>

One would have expected <font face="SPIonic">eirgasato monon, kai oux wj oi d</font>. But the connection, not fully expressed, may be this : "So different from those "grievous wolves not sparing the flock," the false teachers who would make a gain of them! So then" etc.</p>

<sup>6 </sup>By Syria he seems here to mean the northern parts, about Antioch. "They left Cyprus on the left, but nearer to it than the opposite coast of Syria, because he did not wish to come near that either." Mod. text "This is not said idly, but to show that he did not think fit even to come near it (Cyprus), they sailing straight for Syria." What follows required transposition : the derangement, 2, 1 : 3, 5, 7 : 4, 6, 8. </p>

<sup>8 </sup><i>Hom.</i> x. <i>in Matt.</i> E. "But why, you may ask, did he (the Baptist) use a girdle also with his garment?

<p><a name="P1695_1648556"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>The meaning of the latter part of v. 16 (<font face="SPIonic">agontej par w cenisqwmen Mnaswni tini Kupriw k. t. l</font>.) according to Chrys., is that the disciples from Caesarea conducted Paul to the house of Mnason at Jerusalem where he was to lodge, not (as our Eng. vss.), that they brought with them Mnason on their journey from Caesarea to Jerusalem. The former seems the preferable view as there is nothing in the context to intimate that Mnason was at this time in Caesarea and his residence was evidently Jerusalem. The construction of attraction is also equally well resolved in this way.-G. B. S.</p>
