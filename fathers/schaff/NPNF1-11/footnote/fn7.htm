<sup>1 </sup>The accusations against Stephen were probably true in part and false in part. He had doubtless spoken against Jewish legalism and narrowness and had perhaps shown the bearing of O. T. prophecy and of Jesus' doctrine of fulfilment upon the fate of the Jewish system. The charge that he had spoken "against Moses" had, then, a certain verbal truth which made its moral falseness all the more subtle. The perversion of his words was due in part to their utter incapacity to apprehend Christianity as the fulfilment of their own religion which necessarily involved the passing away of the latter, and partly from their bitter jealousy and hatred of the Christian "sect" and the determination to find some excuse to bring against it all the legal and social forces of the whole Jewish people. In his preaching Stephen had doubtless sought to set forth the distinctive character of Christianity as a religion historically founded in Judaism. but not to be limited and bound by its forms. He but developed germs of truth found in the teaching of Jesus concerning the Sabbath, ceremonial purifications, etc. He was the forerunner of Paul, who brought upon himself the same accusations (Acts xviii. 13; xxi. 21).-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>5 </sup>Edd. from E. "And how, it may be asked, doth the Scripture say this concerning Abraham's father? Because it does not trouble itself about matters that are not very essential. What was useful for us to learn, this only it has taught us, that in consequence of his son's vision, he went out with him: the rest it leaves untold, by reason that he died soon after settling in Charran. `Get thee out of thy kindred.0' Here he shows that these men," etc.</p>

The meaning seems to be: "They boasted of their possession of the land, as the token of God's favor to themselves. See how Stephen will not allow them to rest in this conceit. Abraham was `the friend of God,0' yet to him `He gave none inheritance,0' etc. True `He promised to give it0': but if God said (that) He will give it (spoke of giving it at some future time); this very circumstance shows that the Jews had it from Abraham, in consequence of God's favor to him; not as deserved by themselves."</p>

The wording of the passage is not strictly grammatical, but the sense seems to be as expressed above.-E. D. F. omit this sentence, and substitute, "Seest thou?" So Edd.</p>
<p><a name="P732_606325"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>The relation of v. 6 and 7 to v. 5 is, as Chrys. intimates, to show that the apparent incongruity between the promise of God to give the land to Abraham and his seed, and the fact that Abraham never personally possessed the land, was not accidental nor did it involve the failure of the divine promise. Accompanying the promise were divine assurances (Gen. xv. 13, Gen. xv. 14) that a period of bondage and oppression was to precede the occupation of the land which was to be the inheritance of the nation.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P733_607287"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>E. Edd. omit this sentence: and below for "Here again," etc. the same substitute: "This happened also in the case of Christ: for indeed Joseph is a type of Him: wherefore also he narrates the history at large, hinting (at this meaning)."</p>
<p><a name="P734_607664"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>If it be too strong language to say, with Chrys., that Joseph is set forth here as a "type of Christ," it is clear that the narrative of his ill-treatment by his brethren, subsequent exaltation and his return of good for evil to those who had sold him into bondage, is meant to suggest that their treatment of Jesus had been similar.-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P735_610628"></a>
<sup>6 </sup><font face="SPIonic">h de anastasij kaq eauthn</font>. This clause is found in the Catena alone. Something seems to be required as the antithesis to the preceding clause, <font face="SPIonic">tauta men gar meta proair. anqr. hn</font>-for which E. Edd. have <font face="SPIonic">tauta goun ouk apo proair. hn</font>. "These things however did not come of man's purpose."-At the end of the next sentence, Edd. (with E. alone) omit the clause, <font face="SPIonic">o ofeilwn apoqanein</font>: and for <font face="SPIonic">Eita palin</font>, have, "This he says, by way of showing both him (Moses) as savior, and these ungrateful to their benefactor."</p>

<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Ti gar ei mh aneilon auton tw pragmati</font>; <font face="SPIonic">tw logw aneilon wsper kakeinoi</font>. N. and Catena read <font face="SPIonic">aneilen</font>, both times, as if the Compiler understood the passage in the sense of a preceding comment extracted from S. Clem. Alex. Strom. "<font face="SPIonic">fasi de oi mustai logw monw anelein ton Aiguption</font>: the initiated say that Moses struck the Egyptian dead by a word, as in the Acts Peter is related to have done in the case of Ananias," etc. But Chrys. nowhere thus interprets the fact, and the context, <font face="SPIonic">wsper kakeinoi</font>, is against this view.-Below, <font face="SPIonic">di on ezh meta Qeon</font>: i. e. the Hebrew whom Moses saved, v. 24, who is here supposed to be one of the parties in the strife mentioned in v. 26. This however not being clear, A., as usual omits: and the innovator assuming the passage to be corrupt, substitutes, <font face="SPIonic">di wn esontai meta Qeou</font>, giving them counsel by means of which they shall be with God." So Edd.: only Sav. notes in the margin the genuine reading of the other mss. and Cat.</p>
<p><a name="P737_613118"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>E. "But do thou, observing this, stand amazed at the riches of God's wisdom and resources: for, had those not been plotted against, these had not been saved." So Edd.</p>
<p><a name="P739_613956"></a>
<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Touto kai entauqa armottei eipein</font>. Edd. from E. only, <font face="SPIonic">touto kai autouj hrmotte tote eipein</font>: "This was also suitable for them to say at that time." It was not perceived that the recapitulation begins here. See note 5 p. 102. </p>
<p><a name="P740_614706"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>Edd. from E. D. F. "how they exhibited a great (example of) philosophy."</p>
<p><a name="P741_615122"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>Edd. (from E. alone) <font face="SPIonic">kai ouk atimwrhti</font>, "not unavenged (upon their enemies)." But the meaning is, "Their enemies shall not be able to be avenged of them."</p>
<p><a name="P742_615555"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>E. D. F. insert for explanation, <font face="SPIonic">patriarxaj de fhsi touj progonouj</font>: "he calls their ancestors, patriarchs." This is the "humoring" spoken of above: in C.'s time, "patriarch" had become a title of honor.</p>

<sup>13 </sup>Edd. from E. "But they not only did not loose (the afflictions), but even cooperated with those afflicting them, when they ought rather to have cut through them (the afflictions)."</p>
<p><a name="P744_616791"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>Morel. Ben. with E. D. F. omit this clause: Savile transposes it. "But as this (Joseph) reigns there as king where they sold him, so does Christ in His death," etc.-In the next sentence, <font face="SPIonic">touto</font> seems to refer to the description in Gen. xli. 42, Gen. xli. 43, of the distinctions conferred upon Joseph, which perhaps Chrys. cited.-After this sentence, Edd. have (from E. only) the formula of recapitulation, <font face="SPIonic">'All' idwmen k. t. l</font>., which is quite misplaced.-Below, A. and the mod. t. insert <font face="SPIonic">#Ora</font>, before <font face="SPIonic">dia limon oia kataskeuazei</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P745_617799"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>The reading of <font face="SPIonic">tou Suxem</font> (T. R.), doubtless meaning the "father of Sychem" (Gen. xxxiii. 19), is replaced by Tisch., W. and H. (after <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p>.B.C.) with <font face="SPIonic">en Suxem</font>, making <font face="SPIonic">Suxem</font> the name of the place just mentioned-not of the person referred to in the O. T. The Vulgate renders <i>filii Sichem</i> thus coming into collision with the O. T. <i>l. c.</i>-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P746_619681"></a>
<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kai paideia kai grammasin</font>, as the comment on <font face="SPIonic">epaideuqh</font> v. 22, which must be supplied. Cat. has, <font face="SPIonic">kai paideia kai grammata</font>. E. omits the clause, and substitutes, as the beginning of the next sentence, <font face="SPIonic">'Emoi qaumazein eperxetai pwj</font>. "To me it occurs to wonder how he could be forty years," etc. So Edd. </p>
<p><a name="P747_621263"></a>
<sup>17 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ef eautou</font>, b.c. F. D. N. but A. E. Edd. <font face="SPIonic">epi toutou</font> "in the case of this man." So perhaps Oecumen. <font face="SPIonic">epieikwj nun tw adikounti prosferetai</font>.-Below, E. Edd. "With the same spirit they appear to say the same with reference to Christ, `We have no king but Caesar.0' Thus was it ever habitual to the Jews to act, even when receiving benefits. Do you mark their madness? Him who was to save them, they accuse, by saying, `As thou,0' "etc.</p>
<p><a name="P749_623327"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>So A. B. N. Cat. (in C. the sentence <font face="SPIonic">!Idou</font>-<font face="SPIonic">'Iakwb</font> is omitted by an oversight caused by the homoeoteleuton <font face="SPIonic">'Iakwb</font>.) Edd. "Not only does he here show that the Angel which appeared unto him was the Angel of the Great Counsel, but he shows also what loving-kindness God exhibits by this manifestation."</p>
<p><a name="P751_624835"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>i. e. "I have heard their groaning:" not simply ("I have come down) because of their calamities." The expression, "I have heard" denotes His ready sympathy.-But the modern text: "He does not simply say, `I have heard;0' but because of their calamities."</p>
<p><a name="P752_625761"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>Edd. from E. "Therefore in order that having come out of much affliction into rest, they may not be insolent, he permits them to be afflicted." </p>
<p><a name="P753_626659"></a>
<sup>21 </sup><font face="SPIonic">diakroueqe ta legomena</font>. Edd <font face="SPIonic">diamwkasfe</font>, "make a mock at."-Below all the mss. agree in <font face="SPIonic">oioj hn o Kain pro toutou</font>. Either the text is corrupt, or something is needed for explanation. </p>
<p><a name="P755_631801"></a>
<sup>22 </sup><font face="SPIonic">malista de oudeij auton atimazei</font>. Savile justly retains this sentence from the old text. Montf. rejects it, as superfluous, and disturbing the sense. Downe ap. Sav. proposes <font face="SPIonic">oti ouk htimasqn</font>: "<i>non ambit honorem, sed bene secum actum putat si nulla affectus sit ignominia.</i>" But in the old text there is no <font face="SPIonic">alla</font> before <font face="SPIonic">agapa</font>: and the meaning is not, "he thinks himself well off," etc., nor as Ben., "he rejoices that," etc., but, "he is content not to be honored; knowing this at any rate, that nobody can dishonor him."</p>
<p><a name="P756_634958"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>E. Edd. "Thence also the gormandizers (<font face="SPIonic">gastrizomenoi</font>) themselves complain of one another, are in ill humor, haste to be rid of the filth within. Still, even after it is cast out," etc. And below:-"fever and diseases. `Yes,0' say you, `they are sick and are disgusting; it is waste of words to tell us all this, and make a catalogue of diseases: for it is I that am diseased. etc, ...while these luxurious livers one may see in good plight, sleek, merry, riding on horseback.0'" </p>
<p><a name="P757_638032"></a>
<sup>24 </sup>Edd. from E. "in the sea, under a violent storm in winter," and below, "the fishes floating at top, dead, which by reason of the cold had not power to sink to the bottom." </p>
<p><a name="P765_644633"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Here the innovator, not perceiving that the renewed exposition began above, inserts the formula <font face="SPIonic">'All' idwmen anwqen ta eirhmena</font>, and then has: "This, it says, is Moses, which said, A Prophet, etc. To this, I suppose, Christ refers, when He says, `Salvation is of the Jews,0' hinting at Himself. This is he that was in the wilderness, with the Angel that spake unto him. Lo, again he shows, that it was He," etc. So Edd.</p>
<p><a name="P766_645450"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>The meaning of v. 38 is that Moses became (<font face="SPIonic">genomenoj</font>) a mediator between God (represented by the Angel) and the people. Cf. Gal. iii. 19 where the law is said to have been "ordained through angels, by the hand of a mediator" (Moses). No mention is made of angels as revealers of the law in Exodus xix. the first mention of angels in connection with the giving of the law being in a highly poetic passage in Moses' benediction, Deut. xxxiii. 2. (Even here the Heb. text is uncertain. Cf. the lxx. <i>in loco</i>). The function of angels in the giving of the law has a prominent place in later Jewish theology as opposed to the action of mere human ministers. The New Testament notices on the subject reflect this later phase of thought (Cf. Acts vii. 53; Heb. ii. 2). See Lightfoot on Gal. ii. 19.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P767_646604"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>By <font face="SPIonic">logia zwnta</font> are meant living oracles in the sense of operative, effectual, as Jesus affirmed his words to be "spirit and life" (John vi. 63). They contain vital truth. The law was indeed "weak" (Rom. viii. 3) but it was so "through the flesh," i.e. human sinfulness. It was not inherently weak but was so relatively to the great power of sin in man which needed to be overcome.-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P768_647699"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>It is not probable that this passage (v. 39, 40) means that the people proposed to return to Egypt (as Chrys.). In the O. T. the constant representation is that the golden calf (or bull) was worshipped as the image of the divinity who had <i>led them out of Egypt</i> (Ex. xxxii. 4; 1 Kings xii. 28). It seems clearly implied in Ezek. xx. 7, Ezek. xx. 8, Ezek. xx. 24, that the Israelites while in Egypt had been much addicted to the idolatry of the country. The meaning here is that, being discouraged and disappointed on account of Moses' continued absence in the mount, they were ready to transfer their allegiance from Jehovah to some of the divinities to whose worship they had previously been accustomed. The worship of cattle was especially common, as of Apis at Memphis and Mnevis at Heliopolis.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P769_648870"></a>
<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">!Enqa men euxaristein edei</font>, A, B, C. D. F., but N. and Cat. <font face="SPIonic">axaristein</font>.-<font face="SPIonic">E. Kai enfa men autouj axaristein hn</font>. Edd. <font face="SPIonic">eux</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P770_649300"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This clause, omitted by A. b.c., is preserved by N. and the Catena. The calf was one, yet they called it Gods: on which St. Chrys. remarks elsewhere, that they added polytheism to idolatry.-The next sentence may perhaps be completed thus: "that they did not even know that there is One God."-Edd. from E.F.D. "So frantic are they, that they know not what they say."</p>
<p><a name="P771_650369"></a>
<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">dia gar touto epishmainetai</font>. The meaning is: Stephen was accused of speaking against "the customs,"-sacrifices, temple, feasts, etc. Therefore he significantly points to that critical conjuncture. from which these "customs" date their introduction: namely, the Provocation at Horeb. Prior to that, he tells of "living oracles," life-giving precepts: after it, and as its consequence, sacrifices, etc., those statutes which were not good, and ordinances by which a man shall not live, as God says by Ezekiel. Not a word of sacrifice till then: and the first mention is, of the sacrifices offered to the calf. In like manner, "they rejoiced," "the people ate and drank, and rose up to play:" and in consequence of this, the feasts were prescribed: <font face="SPIonic">kai eufrainonto, fhsin: dia touto kai eortai</font>.-<font face="SPIonic">'Epishmainetai</font> might be rendered, "he marks," "puts a mark upon it" (so the innovator, who substitutes, <font face="SPIonic">touto kai Dauid epishmainomenoj legei</font>): we take it passively, "there is a mark set over it-it is emphatically denoted." In the active, the verb taken intransitively means "to betoken or announce itself," "make its first appearance."-In the Treatise <i>adv. Judaeos,</i> iv. §6. tom. i. 624. C. St. Chrysostom gives this account of the legal sacrifices: "To what purpose unto Me is the multitude of your sacrifices? etc. (Isaiah i., 11, ff.) Do ye hear how it is most plainly declared, that God did not from the first require these at your hands? Had He required them, He would have obliged those famous saints who were before the Law to observe this practice. `Then wherefore has He permitted it now?0' In condescension to your infirmity. As a physician in his treatment of a delirious patient, etc.: thus did God likewise. For seeing them so frantic in their lust for sacrifices, that they were ready, unless they got them, to desert to idols: nay not only ready, but that they had already deserted, thereupon He permitted sacrifices. And that this is the reason, is clear from the order of events. After the feast which they made to the demons, then it was that He permitted sacrifices: all but saying: `Ye are mad, and will needs sacrifice: well then, at any rate sacrifice to Me.0'"-(What follows may serve to illustrate the brief remark a little further on, <font face="SPIonic">Kai h aixmalwsia kathgoria thj kakiaj</font>.) "But even this, He did not permit to continue to the end, but by a most wise method, withdrew them from it ...For He did not permit it to be done in any place of the whole world, but in Jerusalem only. Anon, when for a short time they had sacrificed, he destroyed the city. Had He openly said, Desist, they, such was their insane passion for sacrificing, would not readily have complied. But now perforce, the place being taken away, He secretly withdrew them from their frenzy." So here: "Even the captivity impeaches the wickedness (which was the cause of the permission of sacrifice.")</p>

<sup>8 </sup>Our passage here follows the lxx. which speaks of Moloch and Remphan. The terms in the original (vid. R. V.: Amos v. 25-27) are "Siccuth" and "Chiun." It is a disputed point whether these are in the prophecy names of divinities or whether they mean respectively "tabernacle" and "shrine" (or image). The difficulty lies in the ambiguity of the Hebrew text. The name Moloch being akin to the Hebrew word for king (<font face="SPTiberian">rlm</font></p>
<p>), confusion might easily arise. The N. T. text varies from the lxx. only in adding the word <font face="SPIonic">proskunein</font> (43) to lay emphasis upon the charge of idolatry, and in replacing Damascus by Babylon (43), an interpretation from the standpoint of subsequent history. The statement of our text that the Israelites fell into the worship of these divinities <i>in the wilderness</i> rests upon extra-Pentateuchal tradition, derived, perhaps, from such prohibitions of Moloch-worship and similar idolatries as are found in Lev. xviii. 21, and Deut. xviii. 10. The charge in the prophecy of Amos is a general one referring to the frequent lapses of the people into image-worship down to his own time.-G. B. S. </p>

N. <font face="SPIonic">wj o kuwn eidetw (idetw X.) oti</font>. We restore the true reading by omitting <font face="SPIonic">wj</font>. "The dog" is anger: the devil <font face="SPIonic">sainei</font>, not <i>as</i> the dog, but <i>upon</i> the dog, as the <font face="SPIonic">allotrioj</font> in the preceding sentence. "Let our faithful watch-dog see at once that he is an intruder."

<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">an de autouj kai trefh o allotrioj kai outw blaptousin (A. blayousin</font>). The antithesis seems to require the sense to be, "While, if the stranger even feed them, for all that, they do him a mischief." But the words <font face="SPIonic">trefh</font> and <font face="SPIonic">blaptousin</font> are scarcely suitable in the sense, <font face="SPIonic">trofhn didw</font> and <font face="SPIonic">lumainontai</font>.

"If the devil be suffered to pamper our anger, that which should have been our safeguard will prove a bane to us."-Perhaps this is the sense intended in the old reading; but if so, <font face="SPIonic">kai outw</font> is unsuitable. </p>

See note 2.-Montf. notes, "Unus, <font face="SPIonic">eisto mh anelein</font>." But this reading does not appear in any of our mss. though the Catena has it. Edd. from E, have; "How it was that they did not take occasion from what he had said to kill him, but are still mad, and seek an accusation, one may well wonder. So ever in trouble are the wrong-doers. Just then as the chief priests, in their perplexity, said," etc. F. D. adopting part of this addition, "but are still mad, and seek an accusation.

<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">touto de eusebeiaj hn to rhma</font>. i. e. all that Stephen had spoken in accusation of their wickedness, especially v. 51-53, was the language of piety, of a devout man zealous for the honor of God: they could not say, "This is impious;" and they were waiting to catch at something which might enable them to cry out, "He blasphemeth:" and, disappointed of this, they were cut to the heart.-Below Ben. retains (from E. alone) <font face="SPIonic">mh palin kainon ti peri auton allo genhtai</font>, though Savile had restored the genuine reading <font face="SPIonic">mh palin aidesimwteroj genhtai</font>.

The clause <font face="SPIonic">wj pou dieceisin</font> seems to have been intended by the innovator, not as part of the text, but as a gloss, "as is somewhere shown at large." But what Chrys. says is, that Christ was pleased to appear in this attitude to Stephen for the sake of the Jews, in order, etc.-Hom. vi. <i>in Ascens.</i> (Cat. in 1,) he says, "Why standing, and not sitting? To show that He is in act to succor His martyr.

Comp. de Mundi Crest. Hom. ii. t. vi. 447. C. "Why did He cause the face of Stephen to shine? Because he was to be stoned as a blasphemer for saying `Behold,0' etc., therefore God, forestalling this, crowned his face with angelic beauty, to show those thankless ones, that if he were a blasphemer, he would not have been thus glorified." But E. (Edd.) <font face="SPIonic">apo toutou stoxazomai dedoc</font>. "I conjecture that it was from this vision (Erasm.,from this time: Ben. hence) that his face was glorified."

<sup>8 </sup>Chrys, seems to assume that <font face="SPIonic">andrej eulabeij</font> refers to Christian men, a view that has been taken by some modern expositors (as Ewald and DeWette). It is better to understand by the term. pious Jews who were favorably disposed to Christianity (So Meyer, Olshausen, Lechler, Lange, Gloag, Hackett). The usage of <font face="SPIonic">eulabhj</font> in the N. T. favors this view as it is applied to devout persons who were not Christians (vid. ii. 5; Luke ii. 25) in every case, except in xxii. 12 when it refers to Ananias, a Christian, but is used in describing him in a legal point of view: <font face="SPIonic">eulabhj kata ton nomon</font>. Moreover, if Christians had been meant, they would not probably have been designated by so vague a term, but, as uniformly, would have been called <i>disciples</i> or <i>brethren.</i> The burial of Stephen by devout Jews recalls the burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathaea and Nicodemus (John xix. 38, John xix. 39).-G. B. S.</p>
