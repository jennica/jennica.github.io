Mexri gar toutou sugkexwrhto taij yuxaij en tw adh einai</font>. (The latter part is adopted also by D. F.) "Whence also his death became divine. For until this time it had been granted to the souls to be in Hades." This comment is derived from St. Cyril. Al. from whom the Catena cites: "Since we are justified by faith in Him ...He hath wrought a new thing for us, <font face="SPIonic">to mhketi men eij adou trexein taj twn swmatwn apallattomenaj yuxaj kaqa kai prwhn, pempesqai de mallon eij xeiraj Qeou zwntoj</font>: that our souls, on their deliverance from our bodies, no longer as aforetime haste into Hades, but are conveyed into the hands of the Living God. And knowing this, Saint Stephen said, "Lord Jesus receive my spirit." Oecumen, repeats this, almost in the same words.</p>

<sup>12 </sup>The modern text E. F. D. Edd. "But although the persecution then most gained strength, nevertheless God again delivered them, <font face="SPIonic">epiteixisaj autoij ta shmeia</font>. Stephen's death, however, did not quench their rage, nay, increased it rather, wherefore also the teachers, etc. But observe again how good things take their turn with them, and how they are in joy. `For there was great joy,0' it says, `in that city.0' And yet there had also been `great lamentation.0' Thus is God ever wont to do, and to temper things grievous with things joyful, that He may be more held in admiration. But of a long time had this disease been upon Simon; wherefore not even thus is he rid of it." But in the genuine text, (A. b.c. N. Cat. ad. v. 15-17, and 3, 4.) the subject to <font face="SPIonic">eceileto</font> and <font face="SPIonic">epeteixise</font> is not <font face="SPIonic">Qeoj</font>, but <font face="SPIonic">diwguoj</font>: and the persons delivered are not the disciples, but the Samaritans, described as <font face="SPIonic">prokatexomenoi</font>, viz. under the influence of Simon's sorceries. In the last sentence, the meaning is entirely mistaken: for the <font face="SPIonic">noshma</font> is the infatuation of the Samaritans, not the wickedness of Simon.-<font face="SPIonic">'Epeteixise gar autoij ta shmeia</font> can hardly be rendered without an awkward periphrasis: <font face="SPIonic">epiteix. ti tini</font>, a phrase frequently used by St. Chrys., means to raise up something against a person as an <font face="SPIonic">epiteixisma</font>, (as Decelea in Attica against the Athenians in the Peloponnesian war:) see Mr. Field's Index to <i>Hom. in Matt.</i> </p>
<p><a name="P806_692686"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>So A. b.c. N. Cat. Of the Edd., Savile alone retains this clause, the rest follow the mod. text, which rejects it. And indeed it can hardly be doubted, that St. Chrys. himself would have expunged, or altered this statement, had he revised these Homilies: for in the next Hom. he shows that the Philip of vv. 26 ff. was certainly not the Apostle, but probably one of the seven deacons. The fact seems to be, that having had no occasion until now to discuss this question, he had assumed (as others had done before him) that the Philip of the Eunuch's history was the Apostle of that name: thus in <i>Hom. ad Gen.</i> xxxv. §2 (delivered but a few years before), he takes this for granted. Here, however, he perceives that the Philip who preached at Samaria could not be the Apostle: but at present he is still under the impression, that the person by whom the Eunuch was converted was St. Philip the Apostle, and accordingly speaks as in the text, "This Philip, I take it, was one of the Seven; he of the story of the Eunuch was one of the Apostles." Of course it was impossible on a review of the circumstances to rest in this conclusion; and in the very beginning of the next Homily he tacitly revokes the notion here advanced, and points out how the command, "Arise, and go to the south," must have been addressed to Philip in Samaria (the deacon), and not Philip the Apostle in Jerusalem. (See the note there.) The early writers frequently confound the Philip of this chapter (the deacon and evangelist, Acts xxi. 9, with the Apostle: Polycrates <i>ap. Eus. H. E.</i> iii. 30, and v. 24, (see Vales and Heinichen on the former passage.) <i>Const. Apol.</i> vi. 7. S. Clementine <i>Strom.</i> iii. p. 192. Comp. St. Augustin <i>Serm.</i> 266. §5.-S. Isadore of Pelusium, Ep. 448, in reply to a correspondent who was not satisfied with his statement (Ep 447), that "Philip who baptized the Eunuch and catechized Simon was not the Apostle, but one of the Seven," and requested proof from Scripture (<font face="SPIonic">'Epeidh kai marturian zhteij gpafikhn</font> ...<font face="SPIonic">'Epeidh pollown apodeicewn eraj</font>,) bids him observe, ch. viii. 1. that the Apostles remained at Jerusalem: that Philip the Apostle would have been competent to impart the gift of the Spirit: and further suggests, that Philip the deacon, fleeing from the persecution, was on his way through Samaria to Caesarea his native place, (where we afterwards find him xxi. 9), when these events befell, viz. the preaching, etc., at Samaria, and the conversion of the Eunuch.-In the next sentence, <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoi</font> (i.e. the Apostles) <font face="SPIonic">ouk echesan: wkonomhqh toutouj</font> (i.e. Philip the deacon and others) <font face="SPIonic">ecelqein: kai ekeinouj</font> (the Apostles) <font face="SPIonic">usterhsai</font>: "should come after," or rather, "should be lacking, be behindhand, not be forthcoming (at the time):" but Cat. <font face="SPIonic">kai ekeinouj eterwj</font>, "and those (the Apostles) otherwise."-The modern text, after "next to Stephen," proceeds thus: "Wherefore also, when baptizing, he did not impart the Spirit to the baptized, for neither had he authority to do so, since the gift belonged only to the Twelve. But observe; those went not forth; it was Providentially ordered that these should go forth, <font face="SPIonic">oi kai usteroun thj xaritoj dia to mhpw labein Pn. #A</font>., who were deficient in the grace because they had not et received the Holy Ghost. For they received power, etc. Consequently, this was the prerogative of the Apostles."</p>

<sup>16 </sup>Chrys. a propriately remarks that the word <font face="SPIonic">idwn</font> (18) implies that there were visible manifestations connected with the gifts of the Spirit here spoken of. This would seem to show that when it said (16) that the Holy Spirit had not fallen upon any of the Samaritans. that the ordinary influences of the Spirit which accompany conversion, were not referred to, but some special and miraculous endowments such as the gift of tongues. and of prophecy and perhaps of miracles were meant.-G.

<sup>18 </sup>What follows, to the end of the Exposition, has by some accident fallen into strange confusion. In the Translation we have endeavored to restore the proper order. In the first place it should be observed, that the portion beginning <font face="SPIonic">Oi men diamarturamenoi</font>, p. 148. D. Ben and ending at <font face="SPIonic">ote prwton episteusan</font>, p. 149. A. consisting of about 20 lines, is interchanged with the portion of about 25 lines, beginning <font face="SPIonic">Deon oun touton</font>, and ending <font face="SPIonic">ekei tou apostolou</font>, p 149, C. These being restored to their proper order, which is evident from the contents of the two portions, we have, to the end of the Recapitulation, two portions, dividing at <font face="SPIonic">ouk isxusen elein touj apostolouj (ecistato</font>,) p. 148, B. the former beginning with the exposition of v. 4, the second with v. 7, and both ending at v. 24. These, it may be supposed, are two several and successive expositions. But it will be seen on comparing them, that each in itself is often abrupt and incomplete, and that their parts fit into each other in a way which can hardly be accidental. It may also be remarked, that the length of each is the same; each containing about 46 lines. We have marked the order of the mss. and Edd. by the letters <i>a, b,</i> prefixed to the several parts.</p>

A. b.c. This, which is the conclusion of (<i>a</i>), is both corrupt and defective.

The reading <font face="SPIonic">elein t. ap</font>. is probably the true one: <font face="SPIonic">oti ealw</font> is twice said of Simon. Perhaps the passage may be restored somewhat thus: "Seeing his miracles, he was amazed, and came over." He thought to escape detection, he thought the thing was an art: but when he had not power to resist, he plays the hypocrite, as the magicians did, who said, "This is the finger of God. Having seen the Apostles," (hence the reading <font face="SPIonic">idein t. ap</font>.) how by laying on of hands etc.; again he thought it was an art, he thought to purchase it with money: but when he was not able to defeat the Apostles (as it was said above, "he wished to get matter of accusation against them,") again he plays the hypocrite, and says, "Pray ye for me. etc."-Edd. from E. "Seeing signs wrought he was amazed, showing that all was a lie (on his part). It is not said, <font face="SPIonic">Proshlqen</font>, but, <font face="SPIonic">'Ecistato</font>.

<sup>26 </sup>The preaching of Philip in Samaria was the first Gentile mission, for the Samaritans were a mixed people and were regarded as heathen by the Jews. An interesting concatenation of events took its rise in the bold preaching of Stephen. On the one side there proceeded from this the increased opposition of the Jewish nation and the sad calamity of the preacher's own death, but on the other there flowed from this opposition and the persecution which was consequent upon it great benefit. The Christians were indeed scattered abroad by ill-treatment, but with them went the gospel message, and the great work of heathen missions dated directly back to the martyrdom of Stephen. Christian history furnishes no more impressive illustration of the saying of Tertullian: "The blood of martyrs is seed."-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P823_712101"></a>
<sup>27 </sup>In St. Chrysostom's time, little had been done for the conversion and instruction of the peasantry: hence in the latter half of the fourth century <i>paganus</i> came to be as synonymous with "heathen." Even Christian proprietors neglected their duty in this regard, while they improved their properties, and swelled their revenues by great oppression of their tenants and laborers : see <i>Hom. in Matt.</i> xliii., lxi. and at the same time connived at the practice of the old idolatries , for the sake of the dues accruing to them from the temples which still remained. Thus Zeno of Verona, <i>Serm.</i> xv. p. 120, complains: <i>In proediis vestris fumantia undique sola fana non nostis, quoe, si vera dicenda sunt, dissimulanda subtiliter custoditis. Jus templorum ne quis vobis eripiat, quotidie litigatis.</i> The Christianity which was outwardly professed in the country parts was often for want of Churches and Clergy little more than nominal: and the heathen orator Libanius, in his <i>Oratio pro Templis,</i> addressed to the Emperor Theodosius: perhaps did not greatly exaggerate in the following description: "When you are told , that through this proceeding on your part (viz. the destruction of the Temples and suppression of the sacrifices) many are become Christians, you must not forget to distinguish between show and reality . They are not a whit changed from what they were before: they only say they are so. They resort indeed to public acts of religion, and mingle themselves with the general body of Christians . But when they have a show of praying, they invoke either none or the Gods."-Moreover, the country clergy were often themselves ill-taught and needing instruction. Thus <i>Hom. in Col.</i> (t. xi. p. 392) delivered at Constantinople, Chrys. says: "How much instruction is needed by your brethren in the country, and by their teachers (<font face="SPIonic">kai touj ekeinwn didaskalouj</font>)!" Which perhaps was the result of a law passed a.d. 398, <i>Cod. Theodos.</i> xvi. tit. 2 l. 33 which enacted, that the clergy for the Churches founded on states, or in villages, should be from no other state or village, but that to which the Church pertained: and of these a certain number, at the discretion of the bishop, according to the extent of the village, etc.-On the other hand, Chrys. "on the Statues," Or, xix. t. ii. p. 189 dwells with much delight on the virtues and patriarchal simplicity of the rural clergy in Syria, and the Christian attainments of their people.</p>

<sup>9 </sup>It is probable that this eunuch was an Ethiopian by birth and a Jewish proselyte. It was customary for such foreign proselytes, as well as for Jewish non-residents, to go up to Jerusalem to worship. Others suppose him to have been a Jew, resident in Ethiopia; but he is designated as "an Ethiopian." The fact that those in his condition were not admitted to full standing in the congregation of Israel (Deut. xxiii. 1) is not a sufficient reason for the opinion of Meyer that this man must have been an uncircumcised heathen-a "proselyte of the gate," since he could occupy the same relation as native Jews in his condition. Ethiopia lay to the S. of Egypt and Candace was queen of Meroe, the northern portion of the country. Eunuchs not only served as keepers of the harem but sometimes, as here, as royal treasurers.-G. B.

<sup>16 </sup>The eunuch must have heard much said about Jesus at Jerusalem for he had been crucified but five or six years before. In this time of persecution and excitement, discussions would be rife concerning the Christian interpretation of prophecy. The eunuch seems to have heard two theories concerning the prophecies (e.g. Is. liii.) relating to the "Servant of Jehovah," one that the prophet was speaking of the Messiah (whom the Christians asserted Jesus to be) and the other that the prophet spoke concerning himself in these prophecies, an opinion not wholly abandoned in modern times. The eunuch's sudden conversion presupposes prolonged consideration of the claims of Jesua to be the Messiah and a keen interest in religious truth.-G. B. S. </p>

Yet this he did, and to his tongue committed his salvation, and endured to put himself in the position of a learner: yea, beseeches, intreats, supplicates, saying, `I pray thee, of whom saith the Prophet this?0' and receives with profound attention what he says. And not only so, but having received, he was not remiss, did not put off, did not say, `Let me get back to my own country, let me see my friends, my family, my kinsfolk0'-which is what many Christians say now-a-days when called to baptism: `let me get to my country, let me see my wife, let me see my children with my other kinsfolk: with them present, and making holiday with me, so will I enjoy the benefit of baptism, so partake of the Grace.0' But not these words spake he, the barbarian: Jew as he was, and trained to make strict account of places, especially with (the Law) ever sounding in his ears the duty of observing the Place, insomuch that he had gone a long journey to Jerusalem, on purpose that he might worship in the place which God commanded: and behold, all at once casting away all that he had been used to in this regard, and relinquishing this strict observance of place, no sooner is the discourse finished, and he sees a fountain by the roadside, than he says, `See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?0'"</p>

The old text has: <font face="SPIonic">ouk hn eukoloj, o profhthj gar auton kathxhsen</font>, but A. rightly omits <font face="SPIonic">gar</font>. Something is wanting; e. g. either, "until Philip catechized him," or rather, "but yet the prophet catechized him." What follows is much confused in the mss. By "the prophecy itself" Chrys. probably means more than the two verses given in the Acts, viz. Isai. liii. 7-12.-"It is likely he had heard that He had been crucified," so C. D. F. (i. e. as appears further on, the eunuch when at Jerusalem had heard of the Crucifixion, had seen the rent in the rocks, etc., another reason why it was fit that he should have first visited Jerusalem:) but B., "Perhaps he had not heard:" and E.

<sup>28 </sup>In the quotation the N. T. follows the LXX. (Is. liii: 7, Is. liii: 8), which but imperfectly renders the original. The meaning is obscure in Hebrew, but the best rendering is probably that of the R. V. which renders v. 8 thus: "By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who <i>among them</i> considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living?" for which the LXX. and N. T. have: "In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare, for his life is taken from the earth." It is almost useless to inquire what the LXX. translators could have meant by this rendering. Concerning the meaning of the first clause, there are four theories: (1) The judgment announced by His enemies was taken away, i. e., annulled by God (Bengel, Lechler). (2) His judicial power was taken away during his humiliation, i.e., he did not appear as men's judge (Humphrey). (3) His judgment (punishment) was taken away, i. e., ended-by death (Meyer, Robinson). (4) The judgment due him-the rights of justice-was withheld by his enemies (Gloag, Hackett).</p>
<p>The latter part of the LXX. trans.: "who shall declare," etc., has been understood in the following ways: (1) Who shall declare his divine Sonship?-the reference being to the "eternal generation" of the Son (the Patristic view). (2) Who shall declare the number of his spiritual seed, i.e., predict the extent of his kingdom? (the Reformers). (3) Who shall declare the wickedness of his contemporaries, for he was put to death (Meyer, De Wette, Lechler, Alford, Gloag). This interp. assigns to the word "generation," the same meaning which the R. V. gives to it in the original passage and is the preferable view. It should be admitted that this is a probable theory of what the LXX. ought to have meant by the words which they used; that they did consciously mean this is far less certain.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>7 </sup>The narratives given by Paul himself of his conversion in Acts xxii. and Acts xxvi. as well as allusion to the subjects in his epistles, present some harmonistic difficulties, which have, however, been greatly exaggerated by a criticism which is unfavorable to the historical character of the Acts. The constant factors in all the accounts are: the light from heaven, the voice of Jesus and Saul's answer, and the solemn charge commissioning Saul to bear the name of Christ to the Gentiles. In Acts xxvi. the interview with Ananias is omitted; in chap. xxii. it is narrated, but the occasion of Ananias' going to Saul is not given; in chap. ix. the Lord is represented as speaking to him and bidding him go, and it is affirmed that at the same time Saul has a vision of his coming. In xxii. the address of Ananias is considerably more extended than in ix. Some minor points of difference have been noted, as: in ix. 7 it is said that Saul's companions heard the voice but saw no one, while in xxii. 9, it is said that they saw the light but heard not the voice of Him who spoke. The discrepancy is resolved by many by translating <font face="SPIonic">hkousan</font> (xxii. 9) "understood"-an admissable sense (so, Lechler, Hackett, Lange). It is certainly an unwarranted criticism which rejects the common matter of the various narratives upon the ground of such incidental variations in the traditions in which a great and mysterious experience has been preserved.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>8 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Skeuoj de kaleitai dikaiwj: deiknuntoj tou logou oti ouk esti fusikh h kakia: skeuoj, fhsin, ekloghj: to dokimon gar ekleg-omeqa</font>. A. b.c. N. i.e. "Justly is he called a <font face="SPIonic">skeuoj</font>, for he is well-fitted for the work of Christ by his energy and earnestness. These need but to be turned to the right objects. It is contrary to right reason to say, that evil is a physical quality or essence, and therefore unchangeable. (See this argued <i>Hom.</i> lix. <i>in Matt.</i> p. 596.) A fit implement, therefore, and of no common kind: a <font face="SPIonic">skeuoj ekloghj</font>, of all others to be chosen, because of its approved suitableness for the purpose." Thus St. Chrysostom constantly interprets this expression. <i>Hom.</i> xviii. <i>in Rom.</i> §6 t. ix. 638. "When the stars were created, the Angels admired: but this man Christ Himself admired, saying, A chosen vessel is this man to Me!" <i>Comm. in</i> c. 1. <i>Gal.</i> §9, t. x. 674 "Called me by His grace. Yet God saith, that He called Him, because of his virtue, (<font face="SPIonic">dia thn arethn</font>,) saying, A chosen vessel, etc.: i.e. fit to do service, and do a great work. . But Paul himself everywhere ascribes it all to grace." <i>Hom.</i> iii. <i>in</i> 1 <i>Tim.</i> §1, t. xi. 562. "God, foreknowing what he would be before he began to preach, saith, A chosen vessel etc. For as they who in war bear the royal standard, the <i>labarum</i> as we call it, have need of much skill and bravery not to deliver it into the enemy's hands, so they that bear the name of Christ," etc. And <i>de Compunct. ad Demetr. lib.</i> i. §9, t. i 138. "Since grace will have our part, (<font face="SPIonic">ta par' hmwn zhtei</font>,) therefore some it follows and abides with, from some it departs, and to the rest it never even reaches. And to show that God first examined well the bent of the will (<font face="SPIonic">proairesij</font>,) and thereupon gave the grace before this blessed man had done aught wonderful, hear what the Lord saith of him: A chosen vessel," etc.-The modern text: "And having said <font face="SPIonic">Skeuoj</font>, so as to show that the evil in him (<font face="SPIonic">h kakia autou</font>) is not physical, He adds, <font face="SPIonic">ekloghj</font>, to declare that he is also approved; for," etc.-Oecumen. <font face="SPIonic">deiknusin oti ouk esti fusikh h kakia autw</font>, "The Lord shows that vice is not natural to him." </p>

<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">dia touto tauta legei</font>: i.e. Ananias' objection, (v. 13) in fact comes to this: this was the feeling' which prompted his words.

Edd.-The meaning is; "In saying, `I will show him how much he shall suffer,0' etc. the Lord rebukes Ananias' reluctance to baptize him, and restore his sight: his answer, `Lord, I have heard,0' etc. was in fact as good as saying, Let him reemain blind, it is better so." The parenthetic, <font face="SPIonic">proj to #Ina anableyh, tauta eirhtai</font>, looks like a marginal note of one who did not perceive the connection.-E. makes it, "To that saying, `That he may receive his sight,0' let this be added."</p>

<sup>12 </sup>It is noticeable that in chap. xxii. 17, Paul is reported as connecting his going to Jerusalem directly with the narrative of his conversion, while in Gal. i. 16, Gal. i. 17 he states that it was not until three years after his conversion that he went up to Jerusalem. The various notices can only be matched together on the view that the coming to Jerusalem mentioned in ix. 26 was the same as that of Gal. i. 18, and that this occurred about three years after his conversion. The <font face="SPIonic">hmerai ikanai</font> of v. 23 must therefore include the time spent in Arabia (Gal. i. 17)., after which Paul must have returned to Damascus, before going up to Jerusalem. In this way the narratives can be harmonized without admitting a contradiction [as Baur, Zeller, De Wette); it is probable, however, that Luke did not know of the visit to Arabia, but connected Paul's going to Jerusalem closely with his conversion.-G. B. S.</p>

V. ...The reference is to the band of converts whom he had been successful in winning at Damascus. In Paul's own narrative of his escape from Damascus (2 Cor. xi. 33) he states more specifically that he was let down "<i>through a window, through the wall.</i>" This may have been either through the window of a house overhanging the wall. or through a window in the face of some portion of the wall (Cf. Josh. ii. 15; 1 Sam. xix. 12).-G. B. S.</p>
