<sup>26 </sup>The old text <font face="SPIonic">kai ebouleto ekeinoj o analiskwn kai thn oikeian eupragian mikran proj thn ekeinou</font>, evidently requires correction, and the emendation assumed in the translation is, <font face="SPIonic">kai eb. ekeinoj einai</font> (<font face="SPIonic">o anal</font>. may perhaps be rejected as a gloss) <font face="SPIonic">kai thn oikeian eupr. m. orwn p. t. ekeinou</font>. Thus the whole passage, from <font face="SPIonic">kai o men idiwthj</font>, refers to the <font face="SPIonic">id</font>. or person feasted, and <font face="SPIonic">ekeinou</font> throughout is the entertainer. The edited text has: <font face="SPIonic">'Ekeinoj de o anal. kai thn oikeian eupr. mikran oran edokei p. t. ekeinou</font>: of which Erasm. makes, <i>Ille autem qui sumptus impendit et suam felicitatem parvam cum ea quam ex sumptu habebat conspicere putabat.</i> But even if this sense lay in the words, it is not easy to see the connection of the following sentence, <font face="SPIonic">Dia touto</font>, etc., Montf. translates, <i>Qui vero sumptus fecit, suam proe illius felicitate parvam putabat,</i> as if <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoj</font> and <font face="SPIonic">ekeinou</font> in the same sentence referred to two different and contrasted persons. The meaning of the passage is, As, on the day before, the entertainer had <font face="SPIonic">to pleon thj eufumiaj</font>, it is but fair that on the following day <font face="SPIonic">to pleon thj afumiaj</font> should be transferred to him. This is expressed by <font face="SPIonic">Dia touto th ust. antididoasin</font>: which however, Erasmus renders, <i>Ideireo sequenti die reddunt sibi vestes iterum:</i> Montf. <i>redduntur vestes.</i> (Perhaps there is an allusion to the legal phrase <font face="SPIonic">antidosij</font>. v. Isocrat. <font face="SPIonic">peri antid</font>). </p>

<sup>27 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Eij anafhmata oude eij, krubdhn</font>. The modern text has <font face="SPIonic">eij aconaj oude eij, kurbeij</font>, alluding to the peculiar form of tables on which the laws of Athens were written. On critical grounds we retain the reading of the old text, which, as being the more difficult one, is not likely to have been substituted for the other. <font face="SPIonic">Ouk eij anafhmata</font>; "not on public monuments for display." Laws of an Emperor, for instance, engraved on handsome monuments, may be called <font face="SPIonic">anafhmata.

<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">#Ora, poion hn touto mega, to eipein k. t. l</font>. i.e. "He says as yet <font face="SPIonic">oudn mega</font>, nothing great, concerning Christ: nothing even that would be great if said of an ordinary Prophet. For, observe: <font face="SPIonic">poion mega</font>, what sort of great thing was it, to say that Christ was sent from God?" In the following sentences Chrys. seems to have been scarcely understood by his reporter. His meaning may be thus represented: "And yet, so It is: everywhere in the Scriptures we find examples of this remarkable <font face="SPIonic">meiwsij</font>: "Christ was sent from God," seems to be the point most studiously inculcated (<font face="SPIonic">to spoudazomenon</font>): nay, we find it carried to the utmost (<font face="SPIonic">meq' uperbolhj</font>) in some of Christ's own expressions. And so here: when Peter stands up-he, the leader of the Apostles, the lover of Christ, the good shepherd, the man entrusted with the keys of the kingdom of heaven. the man who has received the deposit of the Wisdom of the Spirit-after he has subdued the audience by the terrors of the coming judgments, has shown that he and his company have received wonderful gifts as foretold by the Prophet, and has made it felt that they have a right to be believed: you may well expect after all this that his first word about Christ will be something great; that he will certainly launch out boldly into the declaration, He is risen! Only think, though, what boldness to say this in the midst of the murderers!-Nothing of the kind. He begins with, "Jesus the Nazarene, a man proved to be from God unto you by signs, etc. which-(He did? no, but) God did by Him, etc. Wait awhile, however: the Orator will say all that needs to be said in due time."</p>

<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Ei gar kai wrismenon hn, fhsin, omwj androfonoi hsan</font>. b.c. after <font face="SPIonic">apall. tou egklhmatoj</font>, and before the text. As the sentence so placed seemed to make Chrys. contradict himself, the other mss. and Edd. before Ben. omit it. Something is wanting, which perhaps may be supplied from Oecumen. <font face="SPIonic">'Alla kai apallasswn ouk afihsin autouj panth tou egklhmatoj. 'Epagei gar, oti dia xeirwn anomwn aneilete</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P413_244351"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>In v. 23, the preferable reading is <font face="SPIonic">dia xeiroj anomwn</font>, "through the hand of lawless men," instead of <font face="SPIonic">dia xeirwn anomwn</font> of the Text. Recep. So A, B, C, D, Tisch. W. and H., Lach. Treg. R. V. This reading is also to be preferred in accordance with Bengel's first rule of text-criticism-<i>Lectio difficilior principatum tenet.</i>-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P414_245167"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>The confusion may be cleared up by supposing that Chrys. here commented upon the words <font face="SPIonic">dia xeirwn anomwn</font> as admitting of a double connection: viz.: with <font face="SPIonic">ekdoton labontej</font> and with <font face="SPIonic">prosp. aneilete</font>. In the former, it refers to Judas: while at the same time, it is shown that of themselves they had no power against Him. He was delivered up by the predestination and will of God, by means of the wicked hands of Judas; upon whom (already gone to his doom) the evil is shifted entire. But again, as <font face="SPIonic">ekdoton</font> is not put simply and without addition (<font face="SPIonic">aplwj</font>), so neither (<font face="SPIonic">oude</font>) is <font face="SPIonic">aneilete</font>: but "by wicked hands ye slew," i. e. by the soldiers.</p>
<p><a name="P415_246408"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The text seems to be corrupt: <font face="SPIonic">kai auto didontoj estin ti: deiknusin oti</font>. B. omits <font face="SPIonic">estin ti</font>. Perhaps <font face="SPIonic">kai auto</font> is derived from an abbreviation of <font face="SPIonic">krateisqai auton</font>: and <font face="SPIonic">didontoj estin ti</font>: may be, "is (the expression) of one assigning something. i.e. some special prerogative to Him:" or, possibly, "For the expression, <font face="SPIonic">Kaqoti ouk hn dunaton</font> even of itself implies the granting of something (in His case):" viz. as a postulate. E. <font face="SPIonic">kai auton didonta emfainei katasxein: kai oti</font>, i.e. "that it Was even He that gave death the power to hold Him:" this, which is adopted by Edd. is, however, not a various reading, but only an attempt to restore the passage. Oecumen. gives no assistance: he has only, <font face="SPIonic">dia de tou, kaqoti ouk hn dun. auton krat., to megaleion autou paristhsi, kai oti ouketi apoqnhskei</font>. In the next sentence E. and Edd. have: "For by `pains of death0' Scripture is everywhere wont to express `danger:0'" but Oecumen. and Cat. agree with the old reading, <font face="SPIonic">h Palaia</font>. Possibly the meaning of the whole passage may be somewhat as follows. "It is something great and sublime that Peter has darkly hinted in saying, `it was not possible that He should be holden of it.0' And the very expression <font face="SPIonic">kaqoti</font> implies that there is something to be thought of (comp. Caren. in 1). Then, in the Old. Test., the expression <font face="SPIonic">wdinej qanatou</font> means pains in which death is the agent; but here they are the pangs inflicted upon death itself, travailing in birth with Christ `the first-begotten from the dead.0' It shows then both that death could not endure to hold Him, and, that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more. For the assertion, etc. But then, without giving them time to ponder upon the meaning of what he has darkly hinted, he goes off to the Prophet," etc.-On the expression <font face="SPIonic">wdinaj luein</font> Mr. Field, <i>Index to Hom. in Matt.</i> s. v., remarks, that "it is said sometimes of the childbearing woman herself, as p. 118. B., sometimes of the child born, as p. 375. A., sometimes of the person aiding in the delivery, as Job xxxix, 2. Hence the obscure passage Acts ii, 34 is to be explained. See Theophylact in 1."</p>
<p><a name="P416_248616"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>It is noteworthy that this interpretation of <font face="SPIonic">wdinaj tou qanatou</font> (24) is exactly that of Meyer who explains thus: "Death travailed in birth-throes even until the dead was raised again. With this event these pangs ceased, <i>they were loosed;</i> and because <i>God</i> had made Christ alive, <i>God</i> has loosed the pangs of death." Other interpretations are: (1) The <i>snares</i> or <i>bands</i> of death, on the ground that <font face="SPIonic">wdinej</font> is used in the lxx. to translate the Hebrew <font face="SPTiberian">lbx</font></p>
<p> (e. g. Ps. xviii. 5), which has this meaning. So Olsh. (2) That the pains <i>of Jesus</i> connected with the whole experience of death are meant. He is popularly conceived as enduring these pains until the resurrection when God loosed them, the conception being that he was under their power and constraint. We prefer this view. So Lechler, Gloag, Hackett.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P417_250050"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>i. e. The former part of the passage cited, down to, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell," as far as the words go, is no more than David might say in reference to himself, or any other saint: viz. he set God always before his face, etc. therefore (<font face="SPIonic">dia touto</font>, referring to v. 26. <font face="SPIonic">dia touto eufr</font>.) death was not in the number of things that cause grief. And St. Peter instead of going at once to that in the prophecy which is peculiar to Christ, with wise management begins with what is less exalted, <font face="SPIonic">ate eisagwgikwterwn logwn deomenoij</font>, Oecumen.-For <font face="SPIonic">dia touto ou twn lupountwn o fanatoj</font>, E. and Edd. have <font face="SPIonic">ina deich, oti ou</font> ..."to show that death," etc. </p>
<p><a name="P419_254953"></a>
<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">tewj manfanwmen kai hmeij outw katexein</font>. As the text stands, this can only mean, "And here by the bye let us also learn how to hold fast Christ; not to hold Him withpain, like one in travail-pangs, who therefore cannot hold fast, but is in haste to be delivered," etc. But this can hardly have been St. Chrysostom's meaning. Something seems to be omitted after <font face="SPIonic">kai hmeij</font> or <font face="SPIonic">outw</font>.-Edd. <font face="SPIonic">tewj de manfanomen kai hmeij dia twn eirhmenwn ti esti to katexein</font>. If this is: "What is the meaning of the expression <font face="SPIonic">katexein</font>, the emphatic <font face="SPIonic">kai hmeij</font> is superfluous; and besides, the word <font face="SPIonic">katexein</font> does not occur in the text commented upon. Oecum. and the Catena give no help.</p>

"Above, St. Peter gave the prophecy by itself: now he adds his own exposition and reasoning, "Being therefore a Prophet." etc.</p>

<sup>14 </sup>i. e. the expression "Lord" is derived from David's, "My Lord:" the expression "Christ," or rather <font face="SPIonic">kai Xriston o Qeoj epoihj en</font>, is from the Psalm: meaning perhaps the second Psalm.

<sup>15 </sup>The two Old Test. pp. (Joel ii. 28-32; Ps. xvi. 8-11) which occur in this chapter are quoted from the lxx., the former freely, the latter with great exactness. The following peculiarities of phraseology are noticeable in the first passage. (1) "In the last days," more definite expression for the Heb. and lxx. "afterward." (2) The partitive expression: "I will pour out <i>of</i> my Spirit," is after the lxx. vs. the original which reads: "I will pour out my spirit." (3) The phrases: "saith God" and "they shall prophesy" (17, 18) are added to both Heb. and lxx. (4) "Vapor" is from lxx. for Heb. "columns." (5) If we read <font face="SPIonic">kai epifanh</font> at the end of v. 20 (as Mey., W. and H.) it is from the lxx. an inaccurate trans. of Hebrew for "fearful," occasioned by misunderstanding on the part of the Seventy of the derivation of the Heb. word. The second pp. follows the lxx. exactly and in several deviations from the original.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>17 </sup>In the modern text the connection is supplied, and the thought expanded. "And yet neither is it any ordinary being that promises it: but One who is beyond comparison greater than the Kingdom itself. Now when the promise is a Kingdom, and God the Giver thereof, it is a great thing, the very receiving from such a Giver. </p>

<sup>18 </sup>In the original the pronouns are <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoj</font> (God), <font face="SPIonic">outoj</font> (the Devil; for which however our mss. have <font face="SPIonic">ou ta</font> and <font face="SPIonic">auta</font>): then inversely, <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoj</font> (the Devil), <font face="SPIonic">outoj</font> (God). The modern text reduces the antithesis to regularity by transposing the first and second clause, with <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoj, outoj</font>, in each member. Mr. Field, however, <i>Hom. in Matt.</i> 709 B. not. has remarked, that St. Chrys. is negligent in his use of these pronouns, and this passage may be added to those cited.</p>
<p><a name="P431_267208"></a>
<sup>19 </sup><font face="SPIonic">!Idwmen ti xrhsimwteron, ti dai</font> (<font face="SPIonic">de</font>, A. N.) <font face="SPIonic">wfelimwteron</font>.

The addition in N. is perhaps the result of unintentional repetition. If meant for emendation, it supposes an antithesis of <font face="SPIonic">xrhj</font>. and <font face="SPIonic">wfelimwteron</font>: "let us grant which is more serviceable (to others): but (the question is) which is more profitable (to one's self)." This, however, is not what the context requires. Rather it seems that something is omitted after <font face="SPIonic">eiphj</font>: e.g. <font face="SPIonic">all' idwmen ti eukolwteron</font>, "But let us see which is more easy." In the following sentence, it is not clear whether <font face="SPIonic">malista men</font> belongs to <font face="SPIonic">dei kai p. u</font>. "of course, if the former appear to be the case, it is necessary," etc. or, to the preceding clause, as in the translation: "above all (consider that it is the devil who gives the bidding), if that appear to be the case (i.e. that it is the easier of the two): it is needful," etc.-Edd. "But not only this, but bethink you that he indeed is the devil: for above all if that be shown, again the prize of victory shall be greater."</p>

<sup>22 </sup>Here is another instance of the negligent use of the pronouns <font face="SPIonic">ekeinoj</font> and <font face="SPIonic">outoj</font> noticed above (note 1).

<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Touto gar en tw baptismati parelabon</font>. St. Chrysostom cannot mean to say that they received the gift of faith in baptism, not having it before: (see Mark xvi. 16, Acts viii. 37.) But the meaning seems to be, with allusion to the <i>traditio symboli</i> in baptism, "He does not as yet say, "Believe:" the question, "Dost thou believe?" would be put to them in their baptism, when the Creed was delivered to them. So that the injunction "Believe" is in fact included in the "Be baptized."</p>

By many it is thought to mean <i>communication</i> (to the needy) in the having all things common (<font face="SPIonic">koina</font>), Ols., Lechler, et al. By others it is understood to refer to the Lord's Supper, but against this view is the fact that <font face="SPIonic">koinwnia</font> did not become a name for the sacrament until the third or fourth century. Others render: <i>fellowship</i> understanding either the participation in common meals (<font face="SPIonic">agapai</font>) or the enjoyment of mutual sympathy, helpfulness and encouragement-the fellowship of Christian friendship. So Bengel, Mey., Hack., Gloag. This view is the preferable one.-G. B. S.</p>

This he says, showing that what had been said," etc. But it is evident that the recapitulation begins here, with v. 37. and <font face="SPIonic">ta lexqenta</font>, and <font face="SPIonic">ekeina</font>, mean the preceding discourse, v. 14-36.; <font face="SPIonic">tauta</font>, not "the many other words," v. 40. but, "Repent and be baptized."</p>

<sup>7 </sup>The main lines of the picture which Luke here draws of the Apostolic community are: (1) Constant teaching and exhortation on the part of the Apostles. (2) Christian fellowship, with prayer and the regular observance of the Lord's Supper. (3) The doing of miracles. (4) The contribution of all to the common fund-not all at once, but gradually and as occasion required-as the imperfects and <font face="SPIonic">kaqoti an tij xreian eixen</font> (v. 44) show. (5) The confident hope and exultant joy with which the work of the new kingdom was carried forward in the conviction that the gospel was for all (v. 39). The <font face="SPIonic">pasin toij eij makran</font> must, we think, refer to the heathen (Calv., Beng., Lech., De W., Lange, Alf., Hack., Gl.) and not merely to distant members of the Jewish nation (Baumg., Mey.).-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>8 </sup>In the old text (mss. and Catena) after <font face="SPIonic">twn pleionwn logwn to kefalaion</font> comes the clause <font face="SPIonic">touto esti, fhsin, h dwrea tou 9A. Pn</font>. where it is clearly misplaced: for <font face="SPIonic">to eukolon k. t. l</font>. is, "Be baptized, and ye shall receive," etc., and <font face="SPIonic">tote epi ton bion agei</font> refers to v. 40.: "And with many other words," of which <font face="SPIonic">pleionwn logwn</font> the <font face="SPIonic">kefalaion</font> is, "Save yourselves," etc. Hence the clause must belong to v. 39. and accordingly the Catena gives the whole passage from <font face="SPIonic">9Aciopistoj o logoj</font> to <font face="SPIonic">epi to bapt. ecerxontai</font>. as the comment on v. 30, 39. We have restored the proper order, and supplied the omitted citations.-The modern text after <font face="SPIonic">to kefalaion</font>, has <font face="SPIonic">kai touto prostiqhsi, deiknuj, oti h dwrea tou 0A. IIn</font>. "Since the hearer, etc. this also he adds, showing that it is the gift of the Holy Ghost."-But the "hearer" is the person hearing or reading the narrative.</p>

St. Chrys. here returns to v. 42. in which he read in his copy the word <font face="SPIonic">omoqumadon</font>. Commenting on that expression, he refers to v. 46 (as his remark on that verse above was that they were taught, <font face="SPIonic">thj didaskaliaj apelauon</font>, in the Temple). Or perhaps this clause may have been added by the scribe, because he did not find <font face="SPIonic">proskart. omoq</font>. in v. 42, but did find it in v. 46.-E. "But he says not <font face="SPIonic">omou</font>, but <font face="SPIonic">omoq</font> since it is possible to be <font face="SPIonic">omou</font> yet not <font face="SPIonic">omoq</font>., when people are divided in opinion.

<sup>2 </sup>There is no evidence that Peter and John attended upon the Jewish worshipsimply "for expediency." There is much to the contrary. The early Christians had no idea of ceasing to be Jews. Peter at this time supposed it to be necessary for the Gentile converts to be circumcised (Gal. ii.). It was incident to the gradual separation of Christianity from Judaism that those who had been zealous adherents of the latter should suppose that its forms were still to be the moulds of the new system. They were not for this reason less honestly and genuinely Christian, but had not yet apprehended the principle of Christian liberty as Paul afterward expounded it. The point of difficulty was not so much the entrance of the Gentiles into the Kingdom of God as the question whether they should enter through the gate of Judaism-G. B. S.</p>

"But let us look over again what has been said. `They went up,0' he says, 'at the hour of prayer, the `ninth hour.0' Perhaps just at that time they carried and laid the lame man, when people," etc. In the old text the clause <font face="SPIonic">auton bastazontej aphnegkan</font> (which should be oi <font face="SPIonic">oi bast. auton</font>) seems meant to explain <font face="SPIonic">kaq hmeran</font>: they bore him daily, and the same persons carried him away.</p>

This is well denoted by <font face="SPIonic">epeginskon</font>: for we use this word, <font face="SPIonic">epi twn molij gnwrizomenwn</font>: strange as it was, they were satisfied that it was he, the man whom they all knew so well. </p>

<sup>11 </sup>It can hardly be imagined that St. Chrysostom's meaning is correctly reported here. <font face="SPIonic">'En arxh tou dihghmatoj</font>, can only mean, In the beginning of the narrative (of this miracle). It seems that the case of this man, who at first lies at the gate of the temple, unable to stir, and in the end, enters with the Apostles walking and leaping and praising God, furnished the theme for the ethical part of the discourse. "There is the like cure for our souls: let us not give over for want of success in the first attempt, but begin again after every failure." </p>
