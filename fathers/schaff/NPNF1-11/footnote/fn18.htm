Possibly the scribes took it to refer to the soldiers: but this is very unsatisfactory. To make sense, it must be read interrogatively: "Well then, at any rate that now, they have got him out of the city, they desist from further attempts?

And yet, Felix might say, it is ye Jews that have been the movers of sedition: in these words ye describe yourselves."-Mod. text "v. 2, 3, 4. And yet ye have done this: then what need of an orator? See how this man, also from the very outset wishes to deliver him up as a revolutionary and seditious person, and with his praises preoccupies the judge. Then as having much to say, he passes it by, and only says this, But that I be not further tedious unto thee."</p>

<sup>6 </sup>As Felix had been many years a judge, he was conversant enough with the habits of the Jews to be aware that the Pentecost which brought Paul to Jerusalem was but twelve days past: so that there had not been time to raise a commotion. Mod. text. "And what did this contribute to the proof? A great point: for he shows that Felix himself knew that Paul had done nothing of all that he was accused of. But if he had ever raised an insurrection, Felix would have known it, being judge, and such an affair would not have scaped his notice."-Below, <font face="SPIonic">dia touto entauqa auton elkei</font>, we suppose <font face="SPIonic">auton</font> to be Felix: Mod. text substitutes <font face="SPIonic">enteuqen afelkwn</font>, referring it to the accuser. The meaning is obscure. but it seems to be, "draws the attention of his judge to this point," viz., of his having come up to worship, and therefore <font face="SPIonic">endiatribei toutw tw dikaiw</font> lays the stress upon this point, of Felix being a <i>just</i> judge.

<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">#Airesij</font> in v. 14 has the same meaning as in v. 5. The meaning is therefore obscured by rendering it (as A. V.) in the former verse by "sect" and in the latter by "heresy." It is <i>party</i> or <i>sect</i> in both cases, used as a term of reproach. Paul's accusers considered him a member of a sect which they contemptuously called the Nazarenes. In his defence he takes up their own word.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>9 </sup>Vv. 5 and 6 had contained the three charges preferred by Tertullus, viz.: sedition, sectarianism and profanation of the temple. Paul was charged with creating disturbances among the Jews (5). To this he replies (11, 12), that the charge is not sustained by facts; he worshipped in the temple, but neither there, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city, did he create a disturbance or gather a crowd. To the second charge that he is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes (5), Paul replies by conceding that he worships the God of his fathers after a way which they call a sect, but he denies that this fact involves rejection or contempt of the law or the prophets (14). To the third charge that he had attempted to profane the Temple (6), he replies by alleging that he had, on the contrary, brought offerings to the Temple service and that he had there peaceably taken part in the religious rites of the Nazarites (17, 18). He concludes by insisting that his whole offence consists in having stoutly maintained the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.-G. B. S.</p>

The part (<i>b</i>) he keeps in its place, viz. before the Recapitulation: there remained (<i>a</i>), and this he prefixes to <i>b,</i> though its contents clearly show that it belongs to the Recapitulation of v. 31. </p>

This may consist with what was said above, <font face="SPIonic">ekballei autwn to proswpon</font>: (see p. 297, note 1) viz. though he does this, and deprives them of the credit they took to themselves, for it was not that they found him; and as to his behavior in the temple, he will not admit their testimony, for they were not present: yet even these he challenges to testify to that of which they were cognizant.-Mod. text "from Asia, saying, Who ought to accuse me before thee, if they had aught against me. So confident was he to be clear as to the matters of which he was accused, that he even challenges them. But not only those from Asia, nay, those also from Jerusalem."</p>

<sup>1 </sup><font face="SPIonic">!Anesij</font> better rendered "relaxation" or "indulgence" (R. V.) than "liberty" (A. V.). Meyer understands by this that he was to be allowed <i>rest,</i> "to be spared all annoyance." Others (DeWette, Lange) suppose <font face="SPIonic">anesij</font> to refer to release from <i>chains,</i> the so-called <i>custodia libera</i> of the Romans in which the prisoner went free on bail or upon the responsibility of some magistrate. This view is, however, inconsistent with the fact that Felix committed Paul to the keeping of a centurion (23) as well as with his leaving Paul bound (27). The custody was doubtless the <i>custadia militaris</i> and <font face="SPIonic">anesij</font> denotes the relaxation of the rigors of his imprisonment.-G.B.S. </p>
<p><a name="P1827_1805175"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Paul's reasoning "concerning righteousness" was directed against the well-known injustice of a prince of whom Tacitus says that he acted as if there were no penalty for villainy. His reasoning "concerning self-control" (<font face="SPIonic">ekrateia</font>) was in opposition to his sensuality. He had unlawfully married Drusilla who was the wife of Azizus, the king of Emesa (Jos. <i>Ant.</i> xx. 7, 2). His references to the judgment to come might well have been directed against the governor's murder of Jonathan, the high priest.-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P1828_1811584"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>This formula is placed by C and mod. text just before the text "Go thy way," etc., v. 25, as if what is said of the wife also hearing, etc., related to the hearing before Agrippa and his wife Bernice.</p>

<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">to</font>, "<font face="SPIonic">fulattesqai</font>;" this seems to refer to xxiii. 35: in v. 4, the expression is <font face="SPIonic">threisqai</font>. Perhaps Chrys. said, "He was safe in custody, for Felix had ordered him <font face="SPIonic">fulattesqai</font>, and there he was still. Then what needs this fresh order that he should <font face="SPIonic">threisqai</font>? He is not attempting to escape, is he?

In the next sentence, he seems to be commenting upon the <font face="SPIonic">pleiouj hmeraj</font> of v. 14 to this effect: "See how his cause is lengthened out by all these delays: the time (ten days) of Festus' stay at Jerusalem; then the second hearing; now again, <font face="SPIonic">pleiouj hmeraj</font>: but for all this, his enemies are not able to effect their design.</p>

<sup>2 </sup>This is the comment on "forgiveness of sins:" the <font face="SPIonic">epieikej</font> consisting in the not enlarging upon the greatness and aggravation of their sins.

<sup>3 </sup>Mod. text "Whether He (as) first to rise from the dead should declare light: as if he had said, Christ as the first that rose dieth no more." It is manifest from the declaring this to all, that they also (have to) expect it for themselves. Then Festus seeing the boldness, since he all along addressed himself to the king, not once ceasing to look full towards him, was as annoyed (<font face="SPIonic">wsper epaqe ti</font>), and says, "Thou art mad, Paul."

"With little ado"-i. e. thou makest short work to persuade me, as if this were an easy thing, to be done in brief: therefore Paul answers, Be it in little, or be it in much, I could pray to God, with no brief and hasty prayer, but <font face="SPIonic">epitetamenwj</font>, much and earnestly.-For <font face="SPIonic">kai oux aplwj</font>, we read <font face="SPIonic">kai en pollw: oux a</font>. and transpose <font face="SPIonic">ti estin en oligw</font> <font face="SPIonic">para mikron</font>, to its fitting place.

<p><a name="P1852_1843574"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The correct interpretation of v. 28, 29 depends upon the ff. points: (1) Whether the remark of Agrippa is sincere or ironical. (2) Whether the true text in v. 29 is <font face="SPIonic">en pollw</font> or <font face="SPIonic">en meralw</font>. (3) What noun, if any, is to be supplied with the adjectives <font face="SPIonic">oligw</font> and <font face="SPIonic">megalw</font> (or <font face="SPIonic">pollw</font>). Regarding the first question, the considerations in favor of the view that Agrippa's remark is <i>ironical</i> are (<i>a</i>) the frivolous character of the man, (<i>b</i>) the current use of <i>Christian</i> among Jews and Romans as a term of reproach and contempt. Touching the second point, we find that <font face="SPIonic">megalw</font> is favored by <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p> A. B. Syr. Copt. Aram. Vulg., as against G. H. for <font face="SPIonic">pollw</font>. The former reading is adopted by Tischendorf, Lachmann, Meyer, Westcott and Hort, and most modern critics, and the evidence in its favor may be considered decisive. Whether any noun is to be supplied to <font face="SPIonic">oligw</font> and <font face="SPIonic">megalw</font> (as most) or not (as Meyer) is not important. In any case the sense must be completed. What do "in little" and "in great" mean? The sense may be completed by supplying (<i>a</i>) the idea of time-"in a little time," i. e. almost. In this case, <font face="SPIonic">en megalw</font> would have to be rendered "wholly" or "altogether," a meaning which <font face="SPIonic">en megalw</font> cannot well convey. Another rendering which might be derived from supplying the idea of time-differing but slightly from the foregoing-would be: "in a little time thou art persuading me!" i. e. dost thou think <i>so soon</i> to persuade me? and Paul replies: "Whether in a little time or in a long time-whether soon or late-I could wish," etc. The first interpretation lays emphasis upon the state of Agrippa's mind-persuaded <i>almost</i>-persuaded <i>altogether;</i> the second upon the element of time required to accomplish the persuasion (ironically spoken of). (<i>b</i>) The idea of labor, trouble or argument may be supplied thus: "Easily-with few words-or with little trouble-thou persuaded me!" and Paul's answer is: Whether with little (labor) or with much, I would to God that," etc. This view we prefer, because, (<i>a</i>) it harmonizes best with the natural meaning of <font face="SPIonic">en megalw</font> which (if the true reading) requires taking both phrases in a quantitative sense. (<i>b</i>) It is favored by the evidently <i>ironical</i> character of Agrippa's remark. There is no ground for the opinion of Chrys. (followed by Calvin) that <font face="SPIonic">en oligw</font> is used in different senses in the language of Agrippa and Paul, much less for the idea that Paul did not understand what <i>en oligw</i> meant!-G. B. S.</p>

That is, "the consequence is that Paul makes his first appearance at Rome, not merely as one who has cleared himself of all charges brought against him at home, but, after these repeated examinations, clear from all suspicion."-Below <font face="SPIonic">oiate kuriwn ouk ontwn twn katadikazontwn auton</font>: the sense intended may be, "seeing they were not his judges, even if they wished to condemn him." </p>

<sup>11 </sup>Mod. text "But not before the tribunal of Lysias alone does he this, but also before Festus, and again here." Ben. cites the old text only to condemn it. Inconsiderately: for it <i>was</i> in the hearing <font face="SPIonic">epi Lusiou</font> xxii. 3-5. (Lysias had no "tribunal") and here, that St. Paul thus challenged the testimony of the Jews: not before Felix, which is what is meant by <font face="SPIonic">ekei</font>, still less before Festus.</p>

The innovator not understanding the phrase, and its reference to <font face="SPIonic">Ei paqhtoj o Xristoj</font> etc., substitutes, "And puts their (words) in the midst."-The meaning is: "He had greater things to say than what the prophets had said:" he could say, "The Christ whom ye slew is risen, for I have seen Him: but instead of this, he put it as a subject for discussion, Did the prophets teach that the Christ was to suffer and to rise again?" </p>

<sup>13 </sup>See above, p. 310, note 1, and.* Yet some modern commentators assert that <font face="SPIonic">en oligw</font> cannot mean, as Chrys. says, <font face="SPIonic">para mikron</font>: that this sense requires <font face="SPIonic">oligou</font>, or <font face="SPIonic">oligou dein</font>, or <font face="SPIonic">par oligon</font>: so that, in their view, Chrysostom's remark <font face="SPIonic">outwj idiwthj hn</font> would be quite out of place.-In the next sentence <font face="SPIonic">ou boulomai</font>, all our mss. and Edd. But Ben. renders it without the negative <i>Et non dixit, Vellem.</i></p>

<sup>14 </sup>He is commenting upon 2 Tim. ii. 9. "I suffer trouble as an evil-doer even unto bonds." To others, this might seem a twofold aggravation: both that he was treated as a malefactor, and that his destruction was intended. For if indeed he was put in bonds <font face="SPIonic">wj ep agaqw</font>, the thing bore its comfort with it, and such was the case to him, but not in their intention; which was, that he should be in chains <font face="SPIonic">kai wj kakourgoj kai wj epi toij deinoij</font>.

<sup>2 </sup>The fast referred to was that which occurred on the great day of atonement (Lev. xxiii. 27) i. e. on the tenth of the seventh month (Tisri). This would be about the end of September, after the autumnal equinox, when navigation was considered dangerous.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>3 </sup>Preponderant authority favors the reading <font face="SPIonic">eurakulwn</font> from <font face="SPIonic">euroj</font>, the S. E. wind and the Latin <i>Aquilo,</i> a N. wind (so <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p>, B* A. Vulgate Erasmus Mill, Bengel, Olshausen, Hackett, Tischendorf, Lachmann, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, R.V.) If <font face="SPIonic">eurokaudwn</font> is read, it is disputed whether the first part of the word is <font face="SPIonic">euroj</font> (Alford, Gloag, Howson,) or <font face="SPIonic">euruj</font>, broad. Meyer defends the latter reading, on the ground that the phrase <font face="SPIonic">o kaloumenoj</font> requires that the word <font face="SPIonic">eur</font>. denote a <i>name</i> and not merely the direction of the wind and that it is easier to suppose that this reading should be modified into the former than the reverse. Alford supposes that <font face="SPIonic">eurakulwn</font> was the name of the wind, which the Greek sailors did not understand and pronounced <font face="SPIonic">eurokludwn</font>. Meyer's argument is inadequate, and the probabilities favor the reading <font face="SPIonic">eurakludwn</font> with the meaning, N. E. wind, a signification, moreover, which answers all the conditions of the narrative. (See Bib. Dict. <i>sub voce.</i>)-G.B.S.</p>

<sup>5 </sup>R. V. "they lowered the gear" (<font face="SPIonic">skeuoj</font>). The word <font face="SPIonic">skeuoj</font>-utensil, implement-is in itself indefinite and must be understood from the context. It has here been taken to mean "anchor;" "mast" (Olshausen); "sail" (Meyer, Lechler, Hackett, A. V.): "gear," meaning the ropes and topsails in order to set the ship in a direction off shore.-G. B.

<sup>5 </sup>The dialogue seems to proceed thus. "If the devil was the cause of Adam's fall, at this rate it ought to follow that all whom the devil tempts should perish (<font face="SPIonic">edei kata touto pantaj touj peirazomenouj apollusqai</font>): if this be not the case, as certainly it is not, then, the cause (of our perishing) is with ourselves (<font face="SPIonic">ei de mh apolluntai, par hmaj h aitia</font>)."

Only it may be doubted whether <font face="SPIonic">ta enantia</font> is to be taken here as above, "Good also are adverse things, or, "their opposites," i. e. "freedom from sorrow, and care, and want, if in moderation." But the context speaks for the latter: viz. "(In moderation), for each of them (both these things and of their opposites) being out of measure destroys: and as the one leaves no solidity or stability (<font face="SPIonic">kai to men xaunoi</font>, i. e. immoderate joy, ease, comfort), so the other by excessive tension breaks."-So below by <font face="SPIonic">tauta</font> we understand "these things and their opposites," which are described as <font face="SPIonic">ta men pikra, ta de hmera</font> (mod text <font face="SPIonic">hdea</font>). </p>
