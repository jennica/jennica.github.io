Oecumen. seems to have considered this as a lowly title, for he says: "And of Christ he speaks lowly, <font face="SPIonic">tw prosqeinai, ton Paida</font>." But to this remark he adds, "For that which in itself is glorified, can receive no addition of glory."-Below <font face="SPIonic">kaqwj en tw prooimiw</font> may refer to the prefatory. matter (after the citation from Joel) of the sermon in ch. ii.: see below, in the Recapitulation, whence we might here supply, <font face="SPIonic">anwterw elegen</font>, "<font face="SPIonic">Ihsoun ton Naz. k. t. l</font>." "As in the opening address [above, he said: `Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God,0' etc.]." Or, "like as in the opening words of this discourse he speaks in lowly manner of themselves." Oecumen. "He still keeps to lowlier matters, both as to themselves, and as to Christ. As to themselves, in saying that not by their own power they wrought the miracle. As to Christ," etc.</p>

The second, "It was ordered by the counsel of God:" as below, "And he puts this by way of apology," etc. The Edd. have adopted the absurd innovation, "`Through ignorance ye did it:0' this is one ground of excuse: the second is, `As did also your rulers:0'" E.

D. N. <font face="SPIonic">klausoumenon</font>, ("to him that shall weep,") A. <font face="SPIonic">kausamenon</font>, Cat. <font face="SPIonic">kausoumenon</font>, the true reading. The scribes did not perceive that Chr. is commenting on the word <font face="SPIonic">anayucewj</font>, "refrigeration," as implying a condition of burning: hence the alteration, <font face="SPIonic">klausomenon</font>, or in the "Doric" form (Aristoph.) <font face="SPIonic">klausoumenon</font>. E. and Edd. <font face="SPIonic">Dio kai outwj eipen eiswj oti proj ton pasxonta kai paramuq. zhtounta k. t. l</font>. "Wherefore also he speaks thus, knowing that it is to the case of one who is suffering," etc.-In the text here commented upon, <font face="SPIonic">opwj an elqwsi kairoi anay</font>., E. V. makes <font face="SPIonic">opwj an</font> temporal, "When the times of refreshing," etc. But here and elsewhere in the N. T. Matt. vi. 5; Luke ii. 35; Acts xv. 17; Rom. iii. 4; the correct usage is observed, according to which, <font face="SPIonic">opwj an</font> is nearly equivalent to "so (shall);" i. e. "that (<font face="SPIonic">opwj</font>) they may come, as in the event of your repentance (<font face="SPIonic">an</font>) they certainly shall." And so Chrys. took the passage: <font face="SPIonic">Eita to kerdoj epagei #Opwj k. t. l</font>. "Then he adds the gain: So shall the times," etc.</p>

<sup>10 </sup>Peter sharpens his accusation of them by the following contrasts: (1) This healing at which you wonder is to the glory of <i>Christ,</i> not of us. (2) <i>God</i> has glorified whom <i>you</i> have betrayed and denied. (3) This you did though Pilate himself would have released him. (4) You preferred to kill the <i>holy and just one</i> and let a <i>murderer</i> go free. (5) You sought to put to <i>death</i> the Author of <i>Life.</i> Vv. 12-15.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>11 </sup>The meaning of the following passage is plain enough, but the innovator has so altered it as to make it unintelligible. Yet the Edd. adopt his reading (E. D. F.) without notice of the other and genuine reading. "And yet if it was <font face="SPIonic">h eij auton pistij</font> that did all, and that (<font face="SPIonic">oti</font>) it was <font face="SPIonic">eij auton</font> that the man believed, why did (Peter) say, not <font face="SPIonic">Dia tou onomatoj</font>, but <font face="SPIonic">'En tw onomati&gt;\/</font> Because they did not yet," etc. </p>

<sup>14 </sup>There is one extenuating circumstance: they did it in ignorance (Cf. Luk. xxiii. 34; 1 Cor. ii. 8; Acts xiii. 27). This fact forms the transition-point to the presentation of a different side of the death of Jesus. It was their crime, but it was also God's plan. They did it from motives of blindness and hate, but God designed it for their salvation. So that Peter, in effect, says: There is hope for you although you have slain the Lord, for his sacrificial death is the ground of salvation. To this view of the death of Christ he now appeals as basis of hope and a motive to repentance (<font face="SPIonic">oun</font> v. 19).-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P520_360241"></a>
<sup>15 </sup><font face="SPIonic">megalhn deiknusi thn boulhn</font>, meaning the determinate counsel of God above spoken of. Above, after <font face="SPIonic">kai palin</font>, some other citation is wanting, in illustration of his remark that the prophecies of the Passion are all accompanied with denunciations of punishment.</p>
<p><a name="P521_361167"></a>
<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">h gar kata agnoian, h kata oikonomian</font>. Edd. omit this interlocution, Sav. notes it in the margin. "Repent ye therefore." Why repent? for either it was through ignorance, or it was predestinated. (Nevertheless, you must repent, to the blotting out of your sins, etc.)</p>
<p><a name="P522_361686"></a>
<sup>17 </sup><font face="SPIonic">touto monon</font>, b.c. N. "this is all:" i. e. no more than this: he does not impute that one great sin to them, in all its heinousness: he only speaks of their sins in general. A. and the other mss. omit these words. </p>
<p><a name="P523_362008"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>The reference is hardly to the resurrection, but to the <i>Parousia.</i> To the hope of this event, always viewed as imminent, all the expressions: "times of refreshing," "times of restitution" and "these days" (vv. 19-24) undoubtedly refer. So Olshansen, Meyer, Alford, Hackett, Gloag, Lechler and most recent critics.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P524_362774"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>The modern text; "Saying this, he does not declare, Whence, but only adds," etc.-<font face="SPIonic">'Akmhn decasqai</font>. Ben. <i>Utique suscipere.</i> Erasm. <i>adhuc accipere.</i> It means, Is this still to take place, that he should say <font face="SPIonic">on dei decasqai</font>, as if the event were yet future? And he answer is, "He speaks in reference to former times, i. e. from that point of view. (So Oecumen. in loc. <font face="SPIonic">to dei anti tou edei</font>.) And then as to the necessity; this <font face="SPIonic">dei</font> is not meant in respect of Christ's Divine Nature (for of that he forbears to speak), but the meaning is, So it is ordered," etc. The report, however, is very defective, especially in what follows. He is commenting upon the words, "Until the time of restitution (or making good) of all that God spake," etc. <font face="SPIonic">pantwn wn elalhsen o Qeoj</font>, which expression he compares with what is said of the Prophet like unto Moses, <font face="SPIonic">pantwn osa an lalhsn</font>. Christ is that Prophet: and what He spake, the Prophets, obscurely indeed, spake before. He adds, that Peter's mention of the yet future fulfilment of all that the Prophets have spoken is calculated also to alarm the hearers. See the further comment on these verses at the end of the recapitulation.</p>

<sup>20 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Ou ouden newteron</font>.

We restore it thus: <font face="SPIonic">'Eplhrwsen</font>; <font face="SPIonic">#A edei paqein eplhrwqh, a de genesqai exrhn oudepw</font>.

A. omits the words <font face="SPIonic">muria</font> . ...<font face="SPIonic">oti</font>, which disturb the sense of the passage. In the translation we have rejected the second <font face="SPIonic">gar</font>. For <font face="SPIonic">eipen</font>, Sav. marg. gives <font face="SPIonic">eipoi tij an</font>, which we have adopted.

<sup>22 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Tauta ola epagwga</font> is strangely rendered by Ben. <i>hoec omnia adjecta sunt.</i> But this is the comment, not upon the threatening in v. 23, but upon the matters contained in the following verses, 24-26.</p>
<p><a name="P528_368375"></a>

D. <font face="SPIonic">kai gar</font>, Cat. <font face="SPIonic">oukoun mh</font>. E. and Edd., which also add at the end of the sentence, <font face="SPIonic">h apobeblhmenoi</font>, where the other mss. have, <font face="SPIonic">Palin h anastasij</font>, as comment on <font face="SPIonic">anasthsaj</font>. </p>
<p><a name="P529_369195"></a>
<sup>24 </sup><font face="SPIonic">To de, Wj eme oudamou logon an exoi</font>. He had before said. that in the very description of "the Prophet like unto Moses," it is shown that He is more than like Moses: for instance, "Every soul which will not hear," etc. would not apply to Moses. Having finished the description, he now adds, You see that the <font face="SPIonic">wj eme</font> nowhere holds as the whole account of the matter: to be raised up (from the dead) and sent to bless, and this by turning every one from his iniquities, is not to be simply such as Moses. The modern text adds, "Unless it be taken in regard of the manner of legislation:" i. e. Christ is like unto Moses considered as Deliverer and Lawgiver, not in any other respect.</p>
<p><a name="P530_370379"></a>
<sup>25 </sup>E. and Edd. "that they shall hear all things which Christ shall say: and this not in a general way, but with a fearful menace" It is a powerful connection, for it shows that for this reason also they ought to obey Him. What means it, "Children of the Prophets," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P533_372453"></a>
<sup>26 </sup><font face="SPIonic">legw dh to mh orgizesqai</font>, as the explanation of <font face="SPIonic">eij touto</font>. The other text confuses the meaning by substituting <font face="SPIonic">kai to mh org</font>. "Not to swear, and not to be angry, is a great help to this." Which increases the "intricacy" of which Ben. complains in the following passage, where oaths are first said to be the wings of wrath, and then are compared to the wind filling the sails. Here instead of, <font face="SPIonic">wsper gar pneuma thj orghj o orkoj, fhsin, esti</font>, (cited as an apothegm), the modern text gives, <font face="SPIonic">wsper gar pn. h orgh kai o orkoj esti</font>. "For wrath and swearing is as a wind." The imagery is incongruous: oaths, the wings of wrath: oaths the wind, and wrath (apparently) the sails: but the alterations do not mend the sense.</p>
<p><a name="P534_373754"></a>
<sup>27 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kan gar mh epiorkhte, omnuntej olwj ouk iste</font>. The modern text, <font face="SPIonic">kai oute epiorkhsete, oute omosesqe olwj. Ouk iste</font>. Which does not suit the context. "Make it a law with the passionate man, never to swear. ...The whole affair is finished, and you will neither perjure yourselves, nor swear at all." He seems to be speaking of oaths and imprecations, by which a man in the heat of passion binds himself to do or suffer some dreadful thing. "Suppose you do not perjure yourself, yet think of the misery you entail upon yourself: you must either study all sorts of expedients to deliver your soul, or, since that cannot be without perjury, you must spend your life in misery, etc. and curse your wrath."-<font face="SPIonic">'Anagkh tini kai desmw</font>, with comma preceding: so Sav. but A. b.c. <font face="SPIonic">anagkh</font> nom. preceded by a full stop: "For needs must you, binding yourselves as with a cord," etc: and so the modern text, with other alterations (adopted by Sav.) which are meant to simplify the construction, but do not affect the sense. Below, <font face="SPIonic">'Epeidh gar hkousate, kai to pleon umin katwrqwtai</font>. Ben makes this a sentence by itself, <i>Quia enim audistis, magna pars ret a vobis perfecta est.</i> Savile connects it with the following, <font face="SPIonic">fere dh k. t. l</font>. See p. 53, where he alludes to some who laughed at him, perhaps even on the spot. </p>

<p><a name="P538_378109"></a>

That this is the meaning, is shown by what follows: <font face="SPIonic">oti ton Qeon ubrisai anexh</font>: "he insults God, and you suffer him to do it." </p>
<p><a name="P541_382995"></a>
<sup>32 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Touj perittouj, kai pantaj emoi agagete</font>. E. and Edd. for <font face="SPIonic">touj perittouj kai</font> have <font face="SPIonic">touj de mh peiqomenouj</font>. The following passage relates to a practice of swearing by touching, the Sacred Volume on the Holy Table. Against this custom he inveighs in one of his Sermons <i>ad Pop. Antioch.</i> xv. §. 5. (t. ii. 158. E.) "What art thou doing, O man? On the Holy Table, and where Christ lies sacrificed, there sacrificest thou thy brother? .... sacrificest him in the midst of the Church, and that, with the death to come, the death which dieth not? Was the Church made for this, that we should come there to take oaths? No, but that we should pray there. Does the Table stand there, that we should make men swear thereby? No, it stands there that we may lose sins, not that we may bind them. But do thou, if nothing else, at least reverence the very Volume which thou holdest forth to the other to swear by: the very Gospel which thou, taking in thine hands, biddest the other make oath thereby,-open it, read what Christ there saith concerning oaths, and shudder, and desist."-Here, he forbids the sacristans to admit persons for any such purpose. "Let such be brought to me, since I must needs be the person to be troubled with these things, as if you were little children, needing to be taught such a simple matter as this."</p>
<p><a name="P542_385220"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>i. e. to take an oath by_the head of your child. So in the <i>Tract. de Virgin.</i> t. i. 309 D. it is remarked, that "men of rude and dull minds, who do not scruple to swear by God in great matters and small, and break their oath without remorse, would not for a moment think of swearing by the head of their children: although the perjury is more heinous, and the penalty more dreadful, in the former than in the latter case, yet they feel this oath more binding than that."</p>
<p><a name="P543_385856"></a>
<sup>34 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kai xairontaj ekaterouj apopemyw</font>. i. e. "both of them glad (to be rid of the quarrel):" unless it is a threat, in the form of an ironical antiphrasis. In a law-suit one party comes off rejoicing (<font face="SPIonic">xairwn</font>): here let both exult-if they can.</p>
<p><a name="P544_386545"></a>

<p><a name="P553_391351"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>It is more likely that <font face="SPIonic">kataggelein en tw 'Ihsou thn anastasin k. t. l</font>. means "to declare in (the case of) Jesus the resurrection," i. e. that the reference is specifically to the resurrection of Jesus instead of (as Chrys.) to the resurrection generally.-G. B. S. </p>
<p><a name="P554_391743"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>So A. C. N. Cat. but B. omits <font face="SPIonic">ouk</font>. Edd. "They had their hands still reeking with the blood of their former victim and they were not chilled (<font face="SPIonic">enarkwn</font>), but again laid them upon others, to fill them with fresh blood. Or perhaps also they feared them as having now become a multitude, and for this reason the captain," etc. But the statement, <font face="SPIonic">uko edeisan to plhqj</font> is explained in the Recapitulation: they led Christ to trial immediately, for fear of the multitude; but not so here.</p>

N. <font face="SPIonic">ergazetai, oude toutouz foboumeqa: ton xwlon anesthse</font>, and so Cat. which however has <font face="SPIonic">esthsan</font>. The meaning is obscure, especially the emphatic <font face="SPIonic">oude toutouj</font>: but perhaps it may be explained: "He was crucified; they did their worst to Him, to how little purpose! therefore neither need we fear these men, what they can do to us." But the report is otherwise so defective and confused, that perhaps what Chrys. actually said here was meant of the priests: "We were able to crucify the Master, therefore we do not fear these common men, His followers, though, as they say, it is He that does these works, that made the lame man walk."</p>
<p><a name="P557_394848"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Something is wanting here: perhaps a remark on the mention of Annas as the high-priest, whereas elsewhere Caiaphas appears to have been high-priest shortly before.</p>

<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">apo tou prooimiou diekwmwdhsen</font>, i. e.

"And he rung them, nay, rather also reminded them," etc. <font face="SPIonic">Diakwdwnizein</font> is a word elsewhere used by St. Chrys., and would suit the passage very well, either as "he put their unsoundness to the proof (like false metal, or cracked earthenware)," or "he sounded an alarm in their ears:" but the other is equally suitable, and better accredited here.

But see the comment in the recapitulation. "Where need was to teach, they allege prophecies; where, to show boldness, they affirm peremptorily." <font face="SPIonic">katorqwsai</font>, "to carry their point," "to come off in the right;" viz. here, to convince by argument.</p>

<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">anatreyai (fhsin) to genomenon ouk eni</font>, A. b.c. Cat. A proverbial expression. Edd. <font face="SPIonic">anatreyai to renomenon ouk isxusan</font>, "Since then they had not power to undo," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P563_402436"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>We have supplied the text, instead of which C. inserts, "What shall we do to these men?" adopted by E. and Edd. Below, after the text 5. 28. E. inserts the latter part of v. 17. "Let us straitly threaten them," etc.</p>

<sup>9 </sup>All our mss. and Cat. <font face="SPIonic">peisqentoj oti anesth, kai touto</font> (A. C. N. <font face="SPIonic">toutou</font>, Cat. <font face="SPIonic">to</font>) <font face="SPIonic">tekm. lab., oti esti Qeoj</font>, except that B. reads <font face="SPIonic">oti an esth Qeoj</font>. Hence we read, <font face="SPIonic">oti anesth</font>. The repetition of these words may have led to the alteration. </p>
<p><a name="P565_403351"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The modern text adds, "And marvel not that they again attempt what had been vainly essayed before."</p>
<p><a name="P566_403747"></a>
<sup>11 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Kai mhn anw kai katw elegon</font>. E. F. D. for the sake of connection insert <font face="SPIonic">dia touto</font> before <font face="SPIonic">elegon</font>, adopted in Edd.</p>
<p><a name="P567_403927"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>The same mss. and Edd. "And that in the Name of Jesus, this man stands before you whole." And below: "And besides, they themselves held, etc. ...: but now they disbelieve and are troubled, taking counsel to do something to them." Again, after "the wickedness of the many:"-"And pray why do they not deliver them up to the Romans? Already they were," etc. All these variations are due to the innovator, who did not perceive that the recapitulation began at the place marked above.</p>
<p><a name="P568_404983"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>The modern text inserts <font face="SPIonic">Kai ti dhpote ou paradidoasin autouj  9Rwmaioij</font>; "And why do they not deliver them over to the Romans? Already they were," etc. And after <font face="SPIonic">wste mallon eautouj ekakizon</font>, the same adds, <font face="SPIonic">upertiqemenoi thn autwn endeiyin</font>: and below, "But concerning these, they neither were bold, nor yet do they take them to Pilate."</p>

<sup>14 </sup><font face="SPIonic">pwz exei kai to baru ta rhmata</font>; <font face="SPIonic">kai en toutoij egumnazonto</font>. i. e. "how their words have the rhetorical quality of <font face="SPIonic">to baru</font>-grave and dignified impressiveness. Even in these, i.e. in the use of words," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P571_407659"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Chrys. rightly remarks upon the great boldness and force of Peter's answer to the Sanhedrin (8-12). The <font face="SPIonic">ei anakrinomeqa, k. t. l</font>. (9) is ironical: "If for doing a good deed a man must make answer." Then follow the bold declarations which are almost of the nature of a challenge (10) "Be it known to <i>you all,</i>" etc., and the assertion that it was in the name which they despised-the "Nazarene"-that the miracle had been wrought and all this is pointed by the contrast: "Ye crucified" but "God raised" and the charge of opposition to the divine plan in that they had rejected the stone which God had made the head of the corner.-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Ou gar ta rhmata monon, kai ta sxhmata edeiknunto to afpontistwj estanai peri toioutwn kpinomenouj</font>. A. C. but the former has <font face="SPIonic">edeiknuon</font>, N. <font face="SPIonic">edeiknu</font>. Our other mss. have, <font face="SPIonic">ou gar toij rhmasi monon edeiknunto afrontistountej p. t. krinomenoi</font>: which is only an attempt to make the passage grammatical. The comment is on the word <font face="SPIonic">qewrountez</font>: they beheld the boldness, for not words only, their gestures also, declared it.-Below, <font face="SPIonic">thn parrhsian enefainon thn kata tou laou. 'Ey wn efqeggonto eqaumazon iswj</font>. Edd. <font face="SPIonic">thn parr. enefainon epi rou laou ey wn efqeggonto. 'Eqaumazon de iswj</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P573_411860"></a>
<sup>17 </sup><font face="SPIonic">af wn elegon</font>; Edd. and Erasm. take this affirmatively: but this can hardly be the Author's meaning; as he has just said that "from the things they uttered, they marvelled" that the speakers should be illiterate and common men. Something perhaps is wanting: e. g. "Not from the matter, but from the dialect, or from the brevity and abruptness of Peter's style, or, from the appearance of the men.-In the mss. the next sentence is, <font face="SPIonic">wste epeskhyan an autoij</font>, <i>Extrema auctoritate mandassent iis,</i> Erasm. <i>Acrius in eos egissent,</i> Ben. Here and in what follows we have endeavored to restore the proper order. In the mss. in consequence, as it seems, of a confusion between the two clauses, <font face="SPIonic">ou, dunameqa apnhsasqai</font>, and <font face="SPIonic">ou dunameqa gar &lt;\=85_mh lalein</font>, the order of the comments is deranged: viz. "So that they would-been with them." "And they recognized-stopped their mouths:" "`Whether it be right-judge ye.0' When the terror-mere bravery. `Whether it be right,0' he says, and, `We cannot deny it.0' So that they would-better to let them go. `Whether it be right-more than unto God.0' Here by God-His Resurrection."</p>
<p><a name="P574_413337"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>The author seems to give two different interpretations of the statement: "They recognized them that they had been with Jesus." (1) They perceived that these were the men whom they had before seen in company with Jesus. (2) They saw that their words and acts betokened association with Jesus. It is evident that the former only is meant in this place.-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P575_414359"></a>
<sup>19 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Kaitoi pantaxou ai arxai deinai kai duskoloi</font>. "If at the beginning you failed, how can you expect to succeed now? for the beginning being always the hardest part of any difficult undertaking, if you could not stop it then, much less afterwards." The modern text unnecessarily alters it to <font face="SPIonic">oupw p. ai a. xalepai te kai dusk</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P576_414975"></a>
<sup>20 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Pollw mallon autoij beltion hn autouj afeinai</font>. N. has a colon at <font face="SPIonic">autoij</font>, which perhaps is better; then the first clause may be the comment on <font face="SPIonic">to kaqolou mh fqeggesqai</font>: "not to speak at all: much more to them. It had been better to dismiss them (at once)." For this sentence E. alone has, <font face="SPIonic">Panu ge, touj ouden umaj hgoumenouj kai apeilountaj</font>: "Aye, men who make nothing of you for all your threatening:" which is adopted by Edd. </p>
<p><a name="P577_415768"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>E. and Edd. "That a notable miracle is done, we cannot deny:" and below "Here they say, of God, for, `of Christ.0' Do you see how that is fulfilled which He said unto them, `Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of wolves; fear them not.0' Then once more they confirm," etc. For <font face="SPIonic">tou Qeou</font>, A. B. have <font face="SPIonic">tou Xristou</font>.</p>

<sup>22 </sup>The various readings are <font face="SPIonic">qsmatwn</font> for <font face="SPIonic">dramatwn</font>, and <font face="SPIonic">merh</font> for <font face="SPIonic">melh</font>. Below, <font face="SPIonic">twn de ekelse legomenwn kai khrugmatwn kai rhmatwn memnhtai pantwn</font>. The mod, omits <font face="SPIonic">kai khr</font>. The meaning is, "He cannot carry away in his memory the preaching which he hears in Church: but the preachments (proclamations) which he hears in the theatre he remember, every word."</p>
<p><a name="P581_420963"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>A description of the attire of a philosopher. Lucian mentions the long beard and the staff, but as the vestment, the <font face="SPIonic">tribwnion</font> or <i>tritum pallium.</i> The <font face="SPIonic">ecwmij</font> elsewhere denotes (in opposition to <font face="SPIonic">epwmij</font>) a tunic without sleeves, forming part of the dress of old men, and slaves, and also used in comedy. Here it seems to mean a cope, perhaps (Doun. ap. Savil.), the original of the academic hood, <i>caputium.</i> </p>
<p><a name="P583_422952"></a>
<sup>24 </sup><i>Tertull. de Corona militum. "Ad omnem progressum atque promotum, ad omnen aditum et exitum, ad calceatum, ad lavacra, ad mensas, ad lumina, ad cubilia, ad sedilia, quaecunque nos conversatio exercet, frontem crucis signaculo terimus."</i></p>
<p><a name="P584_424941"></a>
<sup>25 </sup><font face="SPIonic">uper twn fugadeusantwn auton</font>. When the "intercession" of Moses is spoken of, it is natural to suppose that the reference is to Exod. xxxii. 11 ff. But Sav. and Ben. refer this to Num. xii. 13, perhaps because of <font face="SPIonic">eboa</font> (LXX. <font face="SPIonic">ebohse</font>). But the addition, "for those who had driven him into banishment," does not suit the latter and less memorable occasion: for Miriam and Aaron did but "speak against Moses," not attempt to banish or expel him. More fully expressed, the meaning may be, "For a people who began by making him a fugitive, Ex. ii. 15, Acts vii. 29, and now had put the finishing stroke to their ingratitude." Comp. Ex. xvii. 4; Num. xiv. 10, Num. xiv. 13, etc. </p>

"Here again explaining the `<font face="SPIonic">to auto</font>,0'" etc.-It is in allusion to the same expression that he says a little further on, <font face="SPIonic">'Idou kardia kai yuxh</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P595_434168"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>i. e. the <font face="SPIonic">epi to auto</font> is not local, but moral, the union of all believers in one heart and soul: q. d. "Do not object that it is impossible for all believers to be together now."</p>

<p><a name="P599_438332"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Against the Arians, who from such texts as Matt. xii. 28, inferred the inferiority of the Son, Chrys. says, "Observe, the Father Himself is here said to speak by the Holy Ghost." This is lost in the modern text, which substitutes <font face="SPIonic">Swthr</font> for <font face="SPIonic">Pathr</font>. The text is given in our mss. with these variations. Comp. note a. A. C. <font face="SPIonic">Despota o Qeoj</font> (<font face="SPIonic">o</font> Cat.) <font face="SPIonic">tou patroj hmwn (o N.) dia Pn. 'A stomatoj D. B. Desp. o Q. twn patrwn hmwn o dia Pn.

"Observe how they say nothing idle, but speak of His power only: or rather, just as Christ said to the Jews, If I by the Spirit of God do speak, so these also say, `By the Holy Ghost.0' Behold, the Saviour also speaks by the Spirit. And hear what it is that they my, `Lord, the God Who by the mouth of David,0'" etc.</p>
