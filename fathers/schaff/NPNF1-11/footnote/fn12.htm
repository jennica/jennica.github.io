<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">!Hdh wkeiwto thn proairesin</font>. Strangely rendered by Erasmus, <i>Jam proeelectione assumptus familiariter erat,</i> and Ben. <i>Jam proeelectionem in familiaritatem assumserat.</i> </p>

<sup>14 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ouden ubristikon, o dh kai epi twn prof. epoioun</font>. The meaning appears from the context to be: he speaks throughout with much <font face="SPIonic">epieikeia</font>. When he says <font face="SPIonic">apwqeisqe</font>, he does not upbraid them with this as <font face="SPIonic">ubrij</font>, a personal outrage to himself and Barnabas. though in fact he might have done so, being just what their fathers did to the prophets: but he does not say, Ye repulse us, for the affront is not to us. And he says it to show that in what he is going to say, "Ye judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life," he does not mean that they do this of humility. In short, he says it not by way of complaint, but to justify what he adds, "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles."</p>
<p><a name="P1203_1156956"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Mod. text omits this clause, which we take as an interlocution: q. d. "If the Lord ordered you to go to the Gentiles, why did ye not do this in the first instance." In the next sentence, A. C. <font face="SPIonic">kai touto ou par hmwn par umwn de gegone to, pro umwn</font> (B., with accidental omission, <font face="SPIonic">kai touto pro umwn. Outw gar</font>), meaning, "And this is not our doing, but yours, the `before you:0' i.e. the Gentiles hearing the word before you. But Cat., <font face="SPIonic">kai touto ou pro umwn, par umwn de k. t. l</font>. (attested by the mutilated reading in B.) which we have expressed in the translation.-The mod. text has <font face="SPIonic">plhn touto ou par hmwn, par umwn de gegone to pro umwn ofeilon</font>: which Ben. takes to be corrupt, but leaves in the text, only adopting in the translation <font face="SPIonic">to par hmwn ofeilon</font>, which <i>interpres legisse videtur.</i> Downe <i>ap. Sav.</i> proposes <font face="SPIonic">to pro toutwn umin ofeilomenon</font> <i>vel</i> <font face="SPIonic">ofeilon</font>. <i>Sed praestare videtur lectio quam propono, quamque secutus est vetus Interpres Latinus,</i> Ben. forgetting that the Latin version is Erasmus's (<i>Veruntamen hoc non ex nobis facimus. A vobis autem factum est. quod a nobis oportebat,</i> Erasm.) and was made from E. which has no such reading here. Ed. Par. Ben. 2. expresses the sense of E. thus, <i>Quod nos oporteat ante vos gentes erudire,</i>' it is your doing that it is become our duty to teach the Gentiles before you.</p>

<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">aplastouj ontaj</font> (i.e. the Gentiles who would otherwise have received the Apostles) <font face="SPIonic">kakourgwj dieqhkan</font>, evidently the interpretation of <font face="SPIonic">ekakwsan</font>: not evil-treated the Apostles, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1206_1160407"></a>
<sup>17 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Mh touto elattwsewj einai nomishj</font>. The innovator (Edd.), mistaking the meaning, connects this and the following clauses thus: "For when they said, <font face="SPIonic">ote gar elegon</font>, "Which witnessed," saith it, "before Pontius P., then the (His?) boldness was shown, but here he speaks concerning the people:" what he meant is not easy to see, nor does it much matter. Below, <font face="SPIonic">entauqa peri tou laou fhsin</font>, i.e. the <font face="SPIonic">parrhsia</font> is in reference to their own nation (Israel): they spake boldly to the Gentiles, fearless of the reproaches of the Jews. </p>
<p><a name="P1207_1161296"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>It seems clear from the fact that the apostles are said to have been aware (v. 6) of what the Jews had done against them, that the word <font face="SPIonic">ormh</font> (v. 5) can hardly mean an "assault" (A. V.) or even "onset" (R. V.) in the sense of any open violence. There would be no propriety in Luke adding that they became aware of an attack upon them. <font face="SPIonic"> 9Ormh</font> must have here the sense of <i>appetitus animi</i>-a strong movement of mind, an intention to attack them- "Trieb" "Drang." (Meyer.) The word occurs in but one other passage (Jas. iii. 4) where the <font face="SPIonic">ormh</font> of the pilot is spoken of as directing the ship, evidently, meaning the "purpose" or "intention." (So Trench, Gloag, Meyer, Lechler, Alford.)-G. B. S.</p>
<p><a name="P1208_1162036"></a>
<sup>19 </sup><font face="SPIonic">oudamou ton qumon autwn ekkaiontej</font> (restored to its fitting-place after <font face="SPIonic">katefugon</font>), i. e. as on all occasions we find them for-bearing to kindle the wrath of their enemies, so here, seeing the intended assault, they fled. Mod. text <font face="SPIonic">enqa oudamou</font> and <font face="SPIonic">ekkaiein hn</font>, "fled to Derbe," etc. where (the enemies) had nowhere power to let their wrath blaze against them: so that they went away into the country-parts, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1210_1163444"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>So the order must be restored instead of, <font face="SPIonic">kai touto fhsi dia pistewj ouk ec hmwn: alla to pleon tou Qeou: Qeou gar fhsi to dwpon</font>. The mod. text, "And that it is not ours, but the more (part) God's:" hear Paul saying, "And this not of ourselves, it is the gift of God:" omitting <font face="SPIonic">dia pistewj</font>, which is essential to the sense.-Perhaps we may read, <font face="SPIonic">kai touto, fhsi, to &lt;\dq_dia p</font>."</p>

<sup>22 </sup><font face="SPIonic">dia thn wmothta kai thn apanqrwpian</font>. A strong expression, but so in the <i>Homily on the Parable of the Virgins,</i> Matt. p. 751, Am. Ed. p. 470, he interprets that the oil is charity (alms-giving), and that even virgins, lacking this, "are cast out with the harlots:" <font face="SPIonic">kai ton apanqrwpon kai ton anelehmona isthsi met= autwn</font> (sc. <font face="SPIonic">twn pornwn</font>).</p>

Erasmus translates loosely, <i>videns puerum, quem supra modum tenere amat, oegrotum, illi frigida et quoecumque ablectant, porrigat.</i> Ben., <i>si pater nimis molli puero, etsi infirmanti, frigidam placentam et quoe solum oblectant porrigat.</i> If the text be not corrupt, <font face="SPIonic">pera tou d. malq</font>. may mean, "brought up more tenderly than need be although ill," and <font face="SPIonic">yuxrou</font>, "silly." But the <font face="SPIonic">yuxron</font> following may rather imply the physical sense as above expressed: the child is a poor creature, with no warmth or life in it, yet the father instead of warm and nourishing food, gives it cake and cold drink, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1216_1171411"></a>
<sup>26 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Dia ti ekrothsate</font>; even now while he was protesting against this evil custom, derived from the theatres, some of the hearers could not refrain from expressing their approbation by applause.-Comp. <i>de Sacerdot.</i> lib. v. init. <i>Hom.</i> xv. in <i>Rom.</i> fin, <i>Hom,</i> vii. <i>in Laz.</i> ยงI. xvii. <i>in Matt</i> ยง7.</p>
<p><a name="P1217_1172493"></a>
<sup>27 </sup><font face="SPIonic">malista men oude outw xrhsimoj o epainoj</font>. i.e. as appears from the context, "to the preacher:" it does him no good, it is even a harm, both by hindering him (<font face="SPIonic">kwluma</font>) and by elating his mind (<font face="SPIonic">skirthmata kai phdhmata thj yuxhj</font>). In the intermediate clause, <font face="SPIonic">all' ouk an hkribologhsamhn, mh me tij agroikiaj grafetw</font>, the meaning implied seems to be-"as it would be easy to show, were it not ungracious to point out to you how little your praise is worth." </p>
<p><a name="P1218_1174790"></a>
<sup>28 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Perieimi gar toutouj zhtwn</font>. Read <font face="SPIonic">tropouj</font>. Mod. text adds <font face="SPIonic">pantaj eidena</font> to the former sentence, and here II. <font face="SPIonic">gar kai autoj tropou pantoiouj epizhtwn</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1219_1175638"></a>
<sup>29 </sup><font face="SPIonic">dia twn xrwmatwn thj arethj</font>. Erasm. and Ben. ungrammatically, <i>propter (ob) coloris virtutem;</i> as meaning that such is the virtue or value of the colors, that they are fit to be employed only on imperial portraits. But the connection is plainly this: "the colors are the hues of virtue, the pencil is the tongue, the Artist the Holy Spirit." In the next sentence the old text has: <font face="SPIonic">ouk eukolon touto alla to mh pollh sunhqeia katorqwqhnai</font>, which is corrupt, unless indeed it may be construed, "but (it is) the not being, by reason of long habit, successfully achieved: i.e. it only shows that I have not, such is the force of long habit, succeeded in carrying my point." The mod. text <font face="SPIonic">Ouk euk, to pragma dokei</font>, <font face="SPIonic">kai touto ou fusei alla tw sunhqeia pollh mhpw katorqoun auto memaqhkenai</font>."It seems to be no easy matter, this: and this, not naturally, but by reason that from long habit you have not yet learnt to effect this reformation."</p>

<sup>3 </sup>All our mss. <font face="SPIonic">twn profhtwn</font>. From the recapitulation we restore <font face="SPIonic">twn aoratwn</font>. The meaning may be, He abstains from the mention of things invisible, because he would recall them from their polythesim, therefore avoids whatever would seem to favor the notion of inferior gods. With the restoration <font face="SPIonic">aoratwn</font> we obtain a suitable connection for the part <i>b,</i> both grammatically (in respect of the <i>plur.</i> <font face="SPIonic">emaqon</font>), and in respect of the sense: they spoke only of things visible, for they had learned not always to speak according to the dignity of the subject, but according to the needs of the hearers. In the next sentence (<i>a</i>) in A. b.c. <font face="SPIonic">ti oun</font>; <font face="SPIonic">ei pantwn esti dhmiourgoj, dia ti mh kai eij tauta pronoei</font>; we may understand by <font face="SPIonic">eij tauta</font> "the nations of the world, or their doings:" but the sense perhaps would be improved by supplying <font face="SPIonic">eij</font> after <font face="SPIonic">ei</font>, and restoring <font face="SPIonic">eij</font> for <font face="SPIonic">eij</font>. Perhaps also <font face="SPIonic">tauta</font> is a corruption of <font face="SPIonic">panta</font>. "If One be the Maker of all, why not One also direct all by His Providence:" i. e. if One Creator, why not One Providence? Why imagine a number of inferior Providences?-Mod. text "nowhere mentioning the Prophets, nor, saying for what reason, being Maker of all, He left the Gentiles independent, <font face="SPIonic">ta eqnh afhken autonoma</font>."</p>
<p><a name="P1231_1180787"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>From this point to the end of the recapitulation the matter required to be rearranged. The letters show the sequence of the parts in the old text: in the mod. text a partial restoration of the order has been attempted. The "method" of the derangement explains itself thus-the true order being denoted by the figures 1, 2, 3, etc. we have two portions transposed into the order, 2, 1; (<i>a, b</i>): then four portions taken alternately in the order 1, 3, 2, 4. (<i>c</i> to <i>f</i>): then again two portions in the order 2, 1, (<i>g, h</i>): then again four portions in the alternate order 1, 3, 2, 4, (<i>i</i> to <i>m</i>): and lastly, two in the order 2, 1.</p>
<p><a name="P1232_1181945"></a>
<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">alla mallon epi ton Qeon to pan agein autouj ekeinouj</font>, A. b.c. As v. 17, "Nevertheless," etc. is placed in the mss. before "Observe, he does not wish," etc. the intention is that <font face="SPIonic">to pan</font> should refer to the contents of that verse: "he does not say this to increase their culpability, but he wishes them to refer all to God." But then <font face="SPIonic">ekeinouj</font> is idle, accordingly mod. text substitutes <font face="SPIonic">paideuei</font>. We have removed the text v. 17. to the end of this sentence, so that its comment is (<i>c</i>) <font face="SPIonic">ora pwj lanqanontwj k. t. l</font>. and <font face="SPIonic">ora ou bouletai k. t. l</font>. will belong to v. 10, and <font face="SPIonic">to pan</font> will refer to their ignorance and walking in their own ways.-So Cat. seems to take it, reading <font face="SPIonic">agei h autouj ekeinouj</font>, viz. he rather refers the whole to God, than to those (the heathen) themselves.</p>
<p><a name="P1233_1183224"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>There was doubtless something polemic in the words of vv. 16, 17 inasmuch as the apostle ascribes to the "living God" alone the blessings which the heathen were wont to attribute to their divinities. The language has also a conciliatory element. Their guilt is mitigated, no doubt, by their limited light, but by no means removed, because God had given them evidences of his goodness and power in the return of seasons and harvests. The thought is closely akin to that in the address at Athens (xvii. 23-31) where God is said to have overlooked the times of the ignorance of the heathen, and to that of Rom. i. 18-32; Rom. ii. 14, Rom. ii. 15, where emphasis is laid upon the revelation of God to the heathen world which renders their sinful lives without excuse. The three passages combined yield the following ideas: (1) God has revealed Himself to the heathen in nature and conscience. (2) This revelation is sufficient to found responsibility. (3) As obedience to this inner law would merit God's approval (Rom. ii. 14), so disobedience to it would merit his displeasure. (4) As matter of fact the Gentiles have not followed the light which they had and thus they have wickedly brought upon themselves the wrath of God and the penalties of his moral law.-G. B. S. </p>

"but there they needed <font face="SPIonic">pollhj paramuqiaj</font>, and especially they of the Gentiles, who behooved to be taught much."-The <font face="SPIonic">qermothj</font> of Paul, shown in his zeal for the establishment of the Gospel among the Gentiles: see below at the end of the recap. Then, <font face="SPIonic">eita allh paramuqia</font>, if it be not an accidental repetition of the clause before v. 23. must be referred to the clause. "They commended them to the Lord," which it follows in the mss.</p>
<p><a name="P1237_1189261"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The appointment of elders in every church (which the apostles visited on this journey) is made by Paul and Barnabas. Meyer supposes that the apostles only superintended the popular choice by the church itself. The word employed (<font face="SPIonic">xeirotonej</font>), meaning to stretch forth the hand, as in voting would seem especially appropriate to the idea of a popular election, but the participle here employed (<font face="SPIonic">xeirotonhsantej</font>) has not the <i>church</i> but Paul and Barnabas for its subject. It seems necessary, therefore, to take it in the general and derived sense-to elect-to choose. There were several elders for each church as there had been several for each synagogue, the model for the constitution of the early churches. They were also called bishops (<font face="SPIonic">episkopoi</font>). These with the deacons were the only church officers. (Phil. 1. 1.) Their duty was to be leaders, teachers, and rulers in the churches. They were at once pastors, teachers and rulers. Their functions were co"r-dinate. No one of them was above the others in any particular church. Each church had several co-pastors, teachers or bishops.-G. B. S. </p>

<sup>3 </sup>With Luke's narrative of the Apostolic council at Jerusalem should be compared Paul's (Gal. ii.) which gives additional particulars. The conference marked an epoch in the history of the church. Here came into decisive conflict two opposing tendencies-the Pharisaic tendency which insisted that the Gentiles must enter the Kingdom through the door of the law, and the catholic spirit which, following the principles of Stephen's apology and appreciating the revelations made to Peter, insisted that adherence to the Mosaic law was not only unnecessary, but was positively inconsistent with the freedom and completeness of Christ's salvation. The decree of the council was, no doubt, of great service in checking the Judaizing tendencies of the early church. It was in the line of this decree that the work of Paul was done, as the champion of catholic Christianity. The chief points to be noted in v. 1-12 are: (1) The representatives of the narrower Jewish view came to Antioch on purpose to antagonize the work of Paul and Barnabas among the Gentiles (v. 1). (2) They took the extreme position that salvation depended on circumcision and caused great anxiety and debate among the Gentile Christians regarding their relations to the Mosaic law (v. 2). (3) The Apostles and messengers who were sent to appeal the question to the leaders of the mother church at Jerusalem answered their objections by the <i>fact</i> of the Gentiles' conversion (v. 3-5). (4) Peter's position was now clear and pronounced. This is implied even in his subsequent conduct at Antioch whence he withdrew from the Gentiles (Gal. ii. 11 sq.) which Paul represents as an <i>inconsistency.</i> (5) Peter's view is first given both on account of his prominence among the Apostles and because he had been the first to bear the gospel to the Gentiles.-G. B. S.</p>

<sup>4 </sup>In the mss. and Edd. the part marked (<i>b</i>) is transposed to the beginning (<i>c</i>) of the remarks introductory to the morale, so that the Recapitulation (announced by mod. text at the end of the first sentence of (<i>a</i>) is split into two halves and the latter given first.

Yet even then the will of God was plainly declared. Thus the Apostle argues strongly both from the place-here in the midst of the Jews-and from the time."</p>

Consequently, the heart, not circumcision, is what we must everywhere look to. Nay, he adds, this same expression, <font face="SPIonic">kardiognwsthj</font> was used by the Apostles on the occasion above referred to: so that Peter, by using it here also, declares the Gentiles to be upon a par with the Apostles themselves: no difference between <i>us</i> the Apostles, and them."</p>

This also shows the <font face="SPIonic">epiekeia</font> of Paul and Barnabas, that when they come to Jerusalem, we do not find them complaining of the Jews who had come to Antioch, but they confine themselves to the recital of "all that God had done with them," v. 4: as he had said above, <font face="SPIonic">ouden legousi peri twn eij touj 'Ioudaiouj sumbebhkotwn</font>. The next clause, <font face="SPIonic">'All' ekeiqen palin lambanousin aformhn</font> may be referred to the Apostles, "they again take advantage of this opportunity, viz. of the Judaizing opposition, to establish the freedom of the Gentiles." We have referred it to the Pharisaic brethren, v. 5, for the sake of connection with the following <font face="SPIonic">outwj emeletwn to filarxein</font>.-In the next clause, <font face="SPIonic">kai</font> (mod. text <font face="SPIonic">oi kai</font>), <font face="SPIonic">ouk eidotwn twn apostolwn ememfqhsan</font>, Sav. marg. has <font face="SPIonic">'pemfqhsan</font>, "these Judaizers were not sent with knowledge of the Apostles."</p>

<sup>18 </sup>He means, that to <font face="SPIonic">basileij</font>, when there is an enemy in the field against them, the engrossing theme of discourse, even at table, is how to overcome their enemies. Such was probably the state of things when this Homily was preached: for the note of time in Hom. xliv. implies that it was delivered either at the close of 400 or the beginning of 401 a.d.: now the former of these years was signalized by the revolt and defeat of Gainas. Hence the following passage might be rendered, "they are holding assemblies each day, appointing generals and demanding taxes," etc. The war ended Dec. 400, in the defeat of Gainas. </p>

<sup>2 </sup>This was James, the Lord's brother (Gal. i. 19), who, according to the uniform tradition of the early church, was the Bishop of Jerusalem. He evidently was the chief pastor, as he presides at this conference, and when Judaizing teachers afterwards went down to Antioch from Jerusalem they are spoken of as coming "from James" (Gal. ii, 12). From this it has been inferred that he was the leader of a Judaistic party, but this view is inconsistent with his address here and also with Paul's testimony who says that the "pillar" apostles "imparted nothing" to him, that is, did not correct or supplement his teaching. He was no doubt of a conservative tendency respecting the questions in dispute and may not have been always self-consistent, as Peter certainly was not, but there can be no doubt of his substantial agreement with Paul. His doctrine of justification by works as well as by faith in his epistle is not against this view, since he uses both the words "faith" and "works" in a different sense from Paul, meaning by the former "belief" and by the latter the deeds which are the fruit of the Christian life, instead of meritorious obedience to the Mosaic law.-G. B. S.</p>

"He who in Luke prophesied, Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart."-It is remarkable that it does not occur to Chrys. that Symeon is Simon Peter, though 2 Pet. i. 1 has <font face="SPIonic">Sumewn Petroj</font> in the Cod. Alexandr., and many other mss. In the Mod. text Chrys. is made to say: "Some say that this is he who is mentioned by Luke: others, that he is some other person of the same name. (Acts xiii. 1?) But whether it be the one or the other is a point about which there is no need to be particular; but only. to receive as necessary the things which the person declared."</p>

<sup>4 </sup><font face="SPIonic">apo men tou xronou dhloj hn, to de aciopiston ouk eixe</font>: the former clause seems to be corrupt. The sense in general is, He was manifestly (a prophet), but had not the same authority as the old prophets. Probably the form of opposition was this: <font face="SPIonic">epeidh ekeinoj apo men</font> * * <font face="SPIonic">dhloj hn, apo de tou xronou to aciopiston ouk eixe dia to mh palaioj einai</font>. "Since Symeon, though from * * he was manifestly (a prophet), yet from time had not the like authority because he was not ancient."</p>

<sup>5 </sup>Mod. text, "But it is not of these things that he speaks. And what raising up, you will say, does he mean? That after Babylon." We point it, <font face="SPIonic">poian legei egersin thn meta Babulwna</font>; "Was it raised up? was it not rather razed to the ground (by the Romans)? True it was rebuilt after the return from Babylon, but what sort of raising up does he call that?" For the answer to these questions, not given here, see the Recapitulation (note 4, p. 207).</p>

<sup>6 </sup>Most modern texts omit <font face="SPIonic">panta</font> at the end of v. 17 and then join directly to it <font face="SPIonic">gnwsta ap' aiwnoj</font> only, dropping out the words of the T. R.: <font face="SPIonic">esti tw qewpanta ta erga autou</font>. This reading yields the following translation: "the Gentiles upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from the beginning of the world." (So Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, Westcott and Hort, Gloag. R. V.). This reading encounters the difficulty that the words <font face="SPIonic">gnwsta ap' aiwnoj</font> are considered as a part of the quotation which, in reality, they are not. It is probable that this fact may have led to their expansion into an independent sentence.-G. B. S.</p>

"No more faction. On this occasion I suppose it was that they received the right hand, as he says himself, `They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship.0' On this (same) occasion he says, `They added nothing to me.0' For they confirmed his view: they praised and admired it."</p>
