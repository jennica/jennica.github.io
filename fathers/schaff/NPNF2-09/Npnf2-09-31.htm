text-autospace:none">After Christ was risen from the dead He laid aside all His
passions, I mean His corruption or hunger or thirst or sleep or weariness or
such like. For, although He did taste food after the resurrection<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a> , yet He did not do so because it was a
law of His nature (for He felt no hunger), but in the way of economy, in order
that He might convince us of the reality of the resurrection, and that it was
one and the same flesh which suffered and rose again<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a>
. But He laid aside none of the divisions of His nature, neither body nor
spirit, but possesses both the body and the soul intelligent and reasonable,
volitional and energetic, and in this wise He sits at the right hand of the
Father, using His will both as God and as man in behalf of our salvation,
energising in His divine capacity to provide for and maintain and govern all
things, and remembering in His human capacity the time He spent on earth, while
all the time He both sees and knows that He is adored by all rational creation.
For His Holy Spirit knows that He is one in substance with God the Word, and
shares as Spirit of God and not simply as Spirit the worship accorded to Him.
Moreover, His ascent from earth to heaven, and again, His descent from heaven
to earth, are manifestations of the energies of His circumscribed body. <i>For
He shall so come again to you, saith he, in like manner as ye have seen Him go
into Heaven</i><a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a> .<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

right hand of God the Father, but we do not hold that the right hand of the
Father is actual place. For how could He that is uncircumscribed have a right
hand limited by place? Right hands and left hands belong to what is
circumscribed. But we understand the right hand of the Father to be the glory
and honour of the Godhead in which the Son of God, who existed as God before
the ages, and is of like essence to the Father, and in the end became flesh,
has a seat in the body, His flesh sharing in the glory. For He along with His
flesh is adored with one adoration by all creation<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" style="mso-endnote-id:

do service to the creature in worshipping created nature, or ye say that there

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">Along with the Father and the Holy Spirit we worship the
Son of God, Who was incorporeal before He took on humanity, and now in His own
person is incarnate and has become man though still being also God. His flesh,
then, in its own nature<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a> , if one
were to make subtle mental distinctions between what is seen and what is thought,
is not deserving of worship since it is created. But as it is united with God
the Word, it is worshipped on account of Him and in Him. For just as the king
deserves homage alike when un-robed and when robed, and just as the purple
robe, considered simply as a purple robe, is trampled upon and tossed about,
but after becoming the royal dress receives all honour and glory, and whoever
dishonours it is generally condemned to death: and again, just as wood in
itself<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a> is not of such a nature that it cannot
be touched, but becomes so when fire is applied to it, and it becomes charcoal,
and yet this is not because of its own nature, but because of the fire united
to it, and the nature of the wood is not such as cannot be touched, but rather
the charcoal or burning wood: so also the flesh, in its own nature, is not to
be worshipped, but is worshipped in the incarnate God Word, not because of
itself, but because of its union in subsistence with God the Word. And we do
not say that we worship mere flesh, but God’s flesh, that is, God incarnate.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">The Father is Father<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a>
and not Son<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a> : the Son is Son and not Father: the
Holy Spirit is Spirit and not Father or Son. For the individuality<sup>1<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref10" style="mso-endnote-id:edn10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> is unchangeable. How, indeed,
could individuality continue to exist at all if it were ever changing and
altering? Wherefore the Son of God became Son of Man in order that His
individuality might endure. For since He was the Son of God, He became Son of
Man, being made flesh of the holy Virgin and not losing the individuality of
Sonship<sup>1<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref11" style="mso-endnote-id:edn11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> .<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Further, the Son of God became man, in order that He
might again bestow on man that favour for the sake of which He created him. For
He created him after His own image, endowed with intellect and free-will, and
after His own likeness, that is to say, perfect in all virtue so far as it is
possible for man’s nature to attain perfection. For the following properties
are, so to speak, marks of the divine nature: viz. absence of care and
distraction and guile, goodness, wisdom, justice, freedom from all vice. So
then, after He had placed man in communion with Himself (for having made him
for incorruption<sup>1<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref12" style="mso-endnote-id:edn12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ,
He led him up through communion wills Himself to incorruption), and when
moreover, through the transgression of the command we had confused and obliterated
the marks of the divine image, and had become evil, we were stripped of our
communion with God (for what communion hath light with darkness<sup>1<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref13" style="mso-endnote-id:edn13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> ?): and having been shut out from
life we became subject to the corruption of death: yea, since He gave us to
share in the better part, and we did not keep it secure, He shares in the
inferior part, I mean our own nature, in order that through Himself and in
Himself He might renew that which was made after His image and likeness, and
might teach us, too, the conduct of a virtuous life, making through Himself the
way thither easy for us, and might by the communication of life deliver us from
corruption, becoming Himself the firstfruits of our resurrection, and might
renovate the useless and worn vessel calling us to the knowledge of God that He
might redeem us from the tyranny of the devil, and might strengthen and teach
us how to overthrow the tyrant through patience and humility<sup>1<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14" style="mso-endnote-id:edn14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The worship of demons then has ceased: creation has
been sanctified by the divine blood: altars and temples of idols have been
overthrown, the knowledge of God has been implanted in men’s minds, the
co-essential Trinity, the uncreate divinity, one true God, Creator and Lord of
all receives men’s service: virtues are cultivated, the hope of resurrection
has been granted through the resurrection of Christ, the demons shudder at
those men who of old were under their subjection. And the marvel, indeed, is
that all this has been successfully brought about through His cross and passion
and death. Throughout all the earth the Gospel of the knowledge of God has been
preached; no wars or weapons or armies being used to rout the enemy, but only a
few, naked, poor, illiterate, persecuted and tormented men, who with their
lives in their hands, preached Him Who was crucified in the flesh and died, and
who became victors over the wise and powerful. For the omnipotent power of the
Cross accompanied them. Death itself, which once was maws chiefest terror, has
been overthrown, and now that which was once the object of hate and loathing is
preferred to life. These are the achievements of Christ’s presence: these are
the tokens of His power. For it was not one people that He saved, as when through
Moses He divided the sea and delivered Israel out of Egypt and the bondage of
Pharaoh<sup>1<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref15" style="mso-endnote-id:edn15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> ; nay, rather He
rescued all mankind from the corruption of death and the bitter tyranny of sin:
not leading them by force to virtue, not overwhelming them with earth or
burning them with fire, or ordering the sinners to be stoned, but persuading
men by gentleness and long-suffering to choose virtue and vie with one another,
and find pleasure in the struggle to attain it. For, formerly, it was sinners
who were persecuted, and yet they clung all the closer to sin, and sin was
looked upon by them as their God: but now for the sake of piety and virtue men
choose persecutions and crucifixions and death.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

good gifts? For all are Thine, and Thou askest naught from us save our
salvation, Thou Who Thyself art the Giver of this, and yet art grateful to

incorporeal and uncreate: but after it became flesh, it became also the
subsistence of the flesh, and became compounded of divinity which it always
possessed, and of flesh which it had assumed: and it bears the properties of
the two natures, being made known in two natures: so that the one same
subsistence is both uncreate in divinity and create in humanity, visible and invisible.
For otherwise we are compelled either to divide the one Christ and speak of two
subsistences, or to deny the distinction between the natures and thus introduce

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">The mind was not united with God the Word, as some falsely
assert<sup>1<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" style="mso-endnote-id:edn17" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> , before the
Incarnation by the Virgin and from that time called Christ. That is the absurd
nonsense of Origen<sup>1<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" style="mso-endnote-id:edn18" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
who lays down the doctrine of the priority of the existence of souls. But we
hold that the Son and Word of God became Christ after He had dwelt in the womb
of His holy ever-virgin Mother, and became flesh without change, and that the
flesh was anointed with divinity. For this is the anointing of humanity, as
Gregory the Theologian says<sup>1<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" style="mso-endnote-id:edn19" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> .
And here are the words of the most holy Cyril of Alexandria which he wrote to
the Emperor Theodosius<sup>2<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" style="mso-endnote-id:edn20" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> :
“For I indeed hold that one ought to give the name Jesus Christ neither to the
Word that is of God if He is without humanity, nor yet to the temple born of
woman if it is not united with the Word. For the Word that is of God is
understood to be Christ when united with humanity in ineffable manner in the
union of the oeconomy<sup>2<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref21" style="mso-endnote-id:edn21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> .”
And again, he writes to the Empresses thus<sup>2<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref22" style="mso-endnote-id:edn22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup>
: “Some hold that the name ‘Christ’ is rightly given to the Word that is
begotten of God the Father, to Him alone, and regarded separately by Himself.
But we have not been taught so to think and speak. For when the Word became
flesh, then it was, we say, that He was called Christ Jesus. For since He was
anointed with the oil of gladness, that is the Spirit, by Him Who is God and
Father, He is for this reason<sup>2<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" style="mso-endnote-id:edn23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
called Christ. But that the anointing was an act that concerned Him as man
could be doubted by no one who is accustomed to think rightly.” Moreover, the
celebrated Athanasius says this in his discourse “Concerning the Saving
Manifestation:” “The God Who was before the sojourn in the flesh was not man,
but God in God, being invisible and without passion, but when He became man, He

being <span lang="EL" style="font-family:GraecaII;mso-ansi-language:EL">ajgevnnhton</span>

being <span lang="EL" style="font-family:GraecaII;mso-ansi-language:EL">gevnnhton</span>

co-essential Son arising from the Father alone, and in the case of bodies, the
origin of a co-essential subsistence arising from the contact of male and
female. And thus we perceive that begetting refers not to nature but to
subsistence<sup>2<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" style="mso-endnote-id:edn28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> . For if it did

begotten and unbegotten, could not be contemplated in one and the same nature.
Accordingly the holy Mother of God bore a subsistence revealed in two natures;
being begotten on the one hand, by reason of its divinity, of the Father
timelessly, and, at last, on the other hand, being incarnated of her in time
and born in the flesh.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

begotten of the holy Mother of God is two natures, we reply, “Yea! He is two
natures: for He is in His own person God and man. And the same is to be said
concerning the crucifixion and resurrection and ascension. For these refer not
to nature but to subsistence. Christ then, since He is in two natures, suffered
and was crucified in the nature that was subject to passion. For it was in the
flesh and not in His divinity that He hung upon the Cross. Otherwise, let them
answer us, when we ask if two natures died. No, we shall say. And so two
natures Were not crucified but Christ was begotten, that is to say, the divine
Word having become man was begotten in the flesh, was crucified in the flesh,
suffered in the flesh, while His divinity continued to be impossible.”</p>

the first of a number of brothers. If then the Son of God was called
first-born, but was not called Only-begotten, we could imagine that He was the
first-born of creatures, as being a creature<sup>3<a href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" style="mso-endnote-id:

first-born and Only-begotten, both senses must be preserved in His case. We say
that He is first-born of all creation<sup>3<a href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" style="mso-endnote-id:edn31" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup>
since both He Himself is of God and creation is of God, but as He Himself is
born alone and timelessly of the essence of God the Father, He may with reason
be called Only-begotten Son, first-born and not first-created. For the creation
was not brought into being out of the essence of the Father, but by His will
out of nothing<sup>3<a href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" style="mso-endnote-id:edn32" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> .

Only-begotten, He was also born of a mother. Since, indeed, He participated
just as we ourselves do in blood and flesh and became man, while we too through
Him became sons of God, being adopted through the baptism, He Who is by nature
Son of God became first-born amongst us who were made by adoption and grace
sons of God, and stand to Him in the relation of brothers. Wherefore He said, <i>I
ascend unto My Father and your Father</i><sup>3<a href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" style="mso-endnote-id:edn34" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>

by nature, and “your Father,” in the sense of Father by grace. And “My God and
your God<sup>3<a href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" style="mso-endnote-id:edn35" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> .” He did not say
“our God,” but “My God:” and if you distinguish with subtle thought that which
is seen from that which is thought, also “your God,” as Maker and Lord.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">We confess one baptism for the remission of sins and for
life eternal. For baptism declares the Lord’s death. We are indeed “buried with
the Lord through baptism<sup>3<a href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" style="mso-endnote-id:edn36" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> ,”
as saith the divine Apostle. So then, as our Lord died once for all, we also
must be baptized once for all, and baptized according to the Word of the Lord, <i>In
the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit</i><sup>3<a href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37" style="mso-endnote-id:edn37" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> , being taught the confession in
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Those<sup>3<a href="#_edn38" name="_ednref38" style="mso-endnote-id:edn38" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
, then, who, after having been baptized into Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and
having been taught that there is one divine nature in three subsistences, are
rebaptized, these, as the divine Apostle says, crucify the Christ afresh. <i>For
it is impossible, he saith, for those who were once enlightened, &amp;c., to
renew them again unto repentance: seeing they crucify to themselves the Christ
afresh, and put Him to an open shame</i><sup>4<a href="#_edn39" name="_ednref39" style="mso-endnote-id:edn39" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>
. But those who were not bap tized into the Holy Trinity, these must be
baptized again. For although the divine Apostle says: <i>Into Christ and into
His death were we baptized</i><sup>4<a href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" style="mso-endnote-id:edn40" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup>
, he does not mean that the invocation of baptism must be in these words, but
that baptism is an image of the death of Christ. For by the three immersions<sup>4<a href="#_edn41" name="_ednref41" style="mso-endnote-id:edn41" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> , baptism signifies the three days
of our Lord’s entombment<sup>4<a href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" style="mso-endnote-id:edn42" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> .
The baptism then into Christ means that believers are baptized into Him. We could
not believe in Christ if we were not taught confession in Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit<sup>4<a href="#_edn43" name="_ednref43" style="mso-endnote-id:edn43" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> . For Christ is the
Son of the Living God<sup>4<a href="#_edn44" name="_ednref44" style="mso-endnote-id:edn44" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> ,
Whom the Father anointed with the Holy Spirit<sup>4<a href="#_edn45" name="_ednref45" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn45" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> : in the words of the divine
David, <i>Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
above thy fellows</i><sup>4<a href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" style="mso-endnote-id:edn46" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> .
And Isaiah also speaking in the person of the Lord says, <i>The Spirit of the
Lord is upon me because He hath anointed me</i><sup>4<a href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn47" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> . Christ, however, taught His own
disciples the invocation and said, <i>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit</i><sup>4<a href="#_edn48" name="_ednref48" style="mso-endnote-id:edn48" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
. For since Christ made us for incorruption<sup>5<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" style="mso-endnote-id:edn49" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>
<sup>5<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" style="mso-endnote-id:edn50" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> , and we transgressed His saving
command. He condemned us to the corruption of death in order that that which is
evil should not be immortal, and when in His compassion He stooped to His
servants and became like us, He redeemed us from corruption through His own
passion. He caused the fountain of remission to well forth for us out of His
holy and immaculate side<sup>5<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref51" style="mso-endnote-id:edn51" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ,
water for our regeneration, and the washing away of sin and corruption; and
blood to drink as the hostage of life eternal. And He laid on us the command to
be born again of water and of the Spirit<sup>5<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" style="mso-endnote-id:edn52" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
, through prayer and invocation, the Holy Spirit drawing nigh unto the water<sup>5<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref53" style="mso-endnote-id:edn53" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> . For since man’s nature is
twofold, consisting of soul and body, He bestowed on us a twofold purification,
of water and of the Spirit the Spirit renewing that part in us which is after
His image and likeness, and the water by the grace of the Spirit cleansing the
body from sin and delivering it from corruption, the water indeed expressing
the image of death, but the Spirit affording the earnest of life.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

upon the face of the waters</i><sup>5<a href="#_edn54" name="_ednref54" style="mso-endnote-id:edn54" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
, and anew the Scripture witnesseth that water has the power of purification<sup>5<a href="#_edn55" name="_ednref55" style="mso-endnote-id:edn55" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> . In the time of Noah God washed
away the sin of the world by water<sup>5<a href="#_edn56" name="_ednref56" style="mso-endnote-id:edn56" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup>
. By water every impure person is purified<sup>5<a href="#_edn57" name="_ednref57" style="mso-endnote-id:edn57" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
, according to the law, even the very garments being washed with water. Elias
shewed forth the grace of the Spirit mingled with the water when he burned the
holocaust by pouring on water<sup>5<a href="#_edn58" name="_ednref58" style="mso-endnote-id:edn58" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
. And almost everything is purified by water according to the law: for the
things of sight are symbols of the things of thought. The regeneration, however,
takes place in the spirit: for faith has the power of making us sons (of God<sup>6<a href="#_edn59" name="_ednref59" style="mso-endnote-id:edn59" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> ), creatures as we are, by the
Spirit, and of leading us into our original blessedness.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The remission of sins, therefore, is granted alike to
all through baptism: but the grace of the Spirit is proportional to the faith
and previous purification. Now, indeed, we receive the firstfruits of the Holy
Spirit through baptism, and the second birth is for us the beginning and seal
and security and illumination<sup>6<a href="#_edn60" name="_ednref60" style="mso-endnote-id:edn60" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup>
of another life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

steadfastly keep ourselves pure from filthy works, that we may not, like the
dog returning to his vomit<sup>6<a href="#_edn61" name="_ednref61" style="mso-endnote-id:edn61" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ,
make ourselves again the slaves of sin. For faith apart from works is dead, and
so likewise are works apart from faith<sup>6<a href="#_edn62" name="_ednref62" style="mso-endnote-id:edn62" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
. For the true faith is attested by works.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

those things which are baptized have need of the Holy Trinity for their
maintenance and continuance, and the three subsistences cannot be otherwise
than present, the one with the other. For the Holy Trinity is indivisible.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

was that of the flood for the eradication of sin. The second<sup>6<a href="#_edn65" name="_ednref65" style="mso-endnote-id:edn65" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> was through the sea and the cloud:
for the cloud is the symbol of the Spirit and the sea of the water<sup>6<a href="#_edn66" name="_ednref66" style="mso-endnote-id:edn66" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . The third baptism was that of
the Law: for every impure person washed himself with water, and even washed his
garments, and so entered into the camp<sup>6<a href="#_edn67" name="_ednref67" style="mso-endnote-id:edn67" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
. The fourth<sup>6<a href="#_edn68" name="_ednref68" style="mso-endnote-id:edn68" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
was that of John<sup>7<a href="#_edn69" name="_ednref69" style="mso-endnote-id:edn69" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> ,
being preliminary and leading those who were baptized to repentance, that they
might believe in Christ: <i>I, indeed</i>, he said, <i>baptize you with water;
but He that cometh after me, He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire</i>.<sup>7<a href="#_edn70" name="_ednref70" style="mso-endnote-id:edn70" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> Thus John’s purification with
water was preliminary to receiving the Spirit. The fifth was the baptism of our
Lord, whereby He Himself was baptized. Now He is baptized not as Himself
requiring purification but as making my purification His own, that He may break
the heads of the dragons on the water,<sup>7<a href="#_edn71" name="_ednref71" style="mso-endnote-id:edn71" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup>
that He may wash away sin and bury all the old Adam in water, that He may
sanctify the Baptist, that He may fulfil the Law, that He may reveal the
mystery of the Trinity, that he may become the type and ensample to us of
baptism. But we, too, are baptized in the perfect baptism of our Lord, the
baptism by water and the Spirit. Moreover,<sup>7<a href="#_edn72" name="_ednref72" style="mso-endnote-id:edn72" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
Christ is said to baptize with fire: because in the form of flaming tongues He
poured forth on His holy disciples the grace of the Spirit: as the Lord Himself
says, <i>John truly baptized with water: but ye shall be baptized with the Holy
Spirit and with fire, not many days hence:</i><sup>7<a href="#_edn73" name="_ednref73" style="mso-endnote-id:

baptism of future fire wherewith we are to be chastized.<sup>7<a href="#_edn74" name="_ednref74" style="mso-endnote-id:edn74" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> The sixth is that by repentance
and tears, which baptism is truly grievous. The seventh is baptism by blood and
martyrdom,<sup>7<a href="#_edn75" name="_ednref75" style="mso-endnote-id:edn75" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> which baptism
Christ Himself underwent in our behalf,<sup>7<a href="#_edn76" name="_ednref76" style="mso-endnote-id:edn76" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup>
He Who was too august and blessed to be defiled with any later stains.<sup>7<a href="#_edn77" name="_ednref77" style="mso-endnote-id:edn77" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> The eighth<sup>7<a href="#_edn78" name="_ednref78" style="mso-endnote-id:edn78" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> is the last, which is not saving,
but which destroys evil:<sup>8<a href="#_edn79" name="_ednref79" style="mso-endnote-id:edn79" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>

do not recieve in faith and who do not consider God’s goodness and omnipotence,
but search out divine things with human and natural reasonings. For all the
things that are of God aare above nature and reason and conception. For should
any one consider how and for what purpose God brought all things out of nothing
and into being, and aim at arriving at that by natural reasonings, he fails to
comprehend it. For knowledge of this kind belongs to spirits and demons. But if
any one, under the guidance of faith, should consider the divine goodness and
omnipotence and truth and wisdom and justice, he will find all things smooth
and even, and the way straight. <i>But without faith it is impossible to be
saved</i><sup>9<a href="#_edn93" name="_ednref93" style="mso-endnote-id:edn93" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> . For it is by
faith that all things, both human and spiritual, are sustained. For without
faith neither does the farmer<sup>9<a href="#_edn94" name="_ednref94" style="mso-endnote-id:edn94" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
cut his furrow, nor does the merchant commit his life to the raging waves of
the sea on a small piece of wood, nor are marriages contracted nor any other
step in life taken. By faith we consider that all things were brought out of
nothing into being by God’s power. And we direct all things, both divine and
human, by faith. Further, faith is assent free from all meddlesome
inquisitiveness<sup>9<a href="#_edn95" name="_ednref95" style="mso-endnote-id:edn95" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> .<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

wisdom and power of God. And the power of God is the Word of the Cross, either
because God’s might, that is, the victory over death, has been revealed to us
by it, or because, just as the four extremities of the Cross are held fast and
bound together by the bolt in the middle, so also by God’s power the height and
the depth, the length and the breadth, that is, every creature visible and
invisible, is maintained<sup>10<a href="#_edn103" name="_ednref103" style="mso-endnote-id:edn103" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

as the circumcision was given to Israel: for by it we believers are separated
and distinguished from unbelievers. This is the shield and weapon against, and
trophy over, the devil. <i>This is the seal that the destroyer may not touch
you</i><sup>10<a href="#_edn104" name="_ednref104" style="mso-endnote-id:edn104" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> , as saith the
Scripture. This is the resurrection of those lying in death, the support of the
standing, the staff of the weak, the rod of the flock, the safe conduct of the
earnest, the perfection of those that press forwards, the salvation of soul and
body, the aversion of all things evil, the patron of all things good, the
taking away of sin, the plant of resurrection, the tree of eternal life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

Himself as a sacrifice for our sakes, is to be worshipped as sanctified by
contact with His holy body and blood; likewise the nails, the spear, the clothes,
His sacred tabernacles which are the manger, the cave, Golgotha, which bringeth
salvation<sup>10<a href="#_edn106" name="_ednref106" style="mso-endnote-id:edn106" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> ,
the tomb which giveth life, Sion, the chief stronghold of the churches and the
like, are to be worshipped. In the words of David, the father of God<sup>10<a href="#_edn107" name="_ednref107" style="mso-endnote-id:edn107" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> , <i>We shall go into His

meant is made clear by what follows, Arise, O Lord, into Thy Rest<sup>11<a href="#_edn109" name="_ednref109" style="mso-endnote-id:edn109" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> . For the resurrection comes after
the Cross. For if of those things which we love, house and couch and garment,
are to be longed after, how much the rather should we long after that which
belonged to God, our Saviour<sup>11<a href="#_edn110" name="_ednref110" style="mso-endnote-id:edn110" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup>
, by means of which we are in truth saved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Moreover we worship even the image of the precious
and life-giving Cross, although made of another tree, not honouring the tree
(God forbid) but the image as a symbol of Christ. For He said to His disciples,
admonishing them, <i>Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven</i><sup>11<a href="#_edn111" name="_ednref111" style="mso-endnote-id:edn111" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> , meaning the Cross. And so also
the angel of the resurrection said to the woman, <i>Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth
which was crucified</i><sup>11<a href="#_edn112" name="_ednref112" style="mso-endnote-id:edn112" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> .
And the Apostle said, <i>We preach Christ crucified</i><sup>11<a href="#_edn113" name="_ednref113" style="mso-endnote-id:edn113" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> . For there are many Christs and
many Jesuses, but one crucified. He does not say speared but crucified. It
behoves us, then, to worship the sign of Christ<sup>11<a href="#_edn114" name="_ednref114" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn114" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> . For wherever the sign may be,
there also will He be. But it does not behove us to worship the material of
which the image of the Cross is composed, even though it be gold or precious
stones, after it is destroyed, if that should happen. Everything, therefore,
that is dedicated to God we worship, conferring the adoration on Him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

pre-figured this precious Cross.&lt;mindy&gt; For since death was by a tree, it

top of Joseph’s staff, was the first to image the Cross, and when he blessed
his sons with crossed hands<sup>11<a href="#_edn116" name="_ednref116" style="mso-endnote-id:edn116" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup>

the sea in the figure of the cross and saved Israel, while it overwhelmed
Pharaoh in the depths; likewise also the hands stretched out crosswise and
routing Amalek; and the bitter water made sweet by a tree, and the rock rent
and pouring forth streams of water<sup>11<a href="#_edn118" name="_ednref118" style="mso-endnote-id:edn118" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>

, the tree bringing salvation to those who in faith saw their enemy dead, just
as Christ was nailed to the tree in the flesh of sin which yet knew no sin<sup>12<a href="#_edn121" name="_ednref121" style="mso-endnote-id:edn121" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> .

text-autospace:none">It is not without reason or by chance that we worship
towards the East. But seeing that we are composed of a visible and an invisible
nature, that is to say, of a nature partly of spirit and partly of sense, we
render also a twofold worship to the Creator; just as we sing both with our
spirit and our bodily lips, and are baptized with both water and Spirit, and
are united with the Lord in a twofold manner, being sharers in the mysteries
and in the grace of the Spirit.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

the East is the direction that must be assigned to His worship. For everything
good must be assigned to Him from Whom every good thing arises. Indeed the
divine David also says, <i>Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing
praises unto the Lord: to Him that rideth upon the Heavens of heavens towards
the East</i><sup>13<a href="#_edn129" name="_ednref129" style="mso-endnote-id:edn129" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> .
Moreover the Scripture also says, <i>And God planted a garden eastward in Eden;
and there He put the man whom He had formed</i><sup>13<a href="#_edn130" name="_ednref130" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn130" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> : and when he had transgressed His
command He expelled him and made him to dwell over against the delights of
Paradises<sup>13<a href="#_edn131" name="_ednref131" style="mso-endnote-id:edn131" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ,
which clearly is the West. So, then, we worship God seeking and striving after
our old fatherland. Moreover the tent of Moses<sup>13<a href="#_edn132" name="_ednref132" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn132" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> had its veil and mercy seat<sup>13<a href="#_edn133" name="_ednref133" style="mso-endnote-id:edn133" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> towards the East. Also the tribe
of Judah as the most precious pitched their camp on the East<sup>13<a href="#_edn134" name="_ednref134" style="mso-endnote-id:edn134" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> . Also in the celebrated temple of
Solomon the Gate of the Lord was placed eastward. Moreover Christ, when He hung
on the Cross, had His face turned towards the West, and so we worship, striving
after Him. And when He was received again into Heaven He was borne towards the
East, and thus His apostles worship Him, and thus He will come again in the way
in which they beheld Him going towards Heaven<sup>13<a href="#_edn135" name="_ednref135" style="mso-endnote-id:

Who is good and altogether good and more than good, Who is goodness throughout,
by reason of the exceeding riches of His goodness did not suffer Himself, that
is His nature, only to be good, with no other to participate therein, but
because of this He made first the spiritual and heavenly powers: next the visible
and sensible universe: next man with his spiritual and sentient nature. All
things, therefore, which he made, share in His goodness in respect of their
existence. For He Himself is existence to all, since all things that are, are
in Him<sup>14<a href="#_edn140" name="_ednref140" style="mso-endnote-id:edn140" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> , not only because
it was He that brought them out of nothing into being, but because His energy
preserves and maintains all that He made: and in especial the living creatures.
For both in that they exist and in that they enjoy life they share in His goodness.
But in truth those of them that have reason have a still greater share in that,
both because of what has been already said and also because of the very reason
which they possess. For they are somehow more dearly akin to Him, even though

will, received the power of continuous union with God through his own choice,

death and corruption, the Creator and Maker of our race, because of His bowels
of compassion, took on our likeness, becoming man in all things but without
sin, and was united to our nature<sup>14<a href="#_edn141" name="_ednref141" style="mso-endnote-id:edn141" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup>

our nature should partake in the higher good but every man who wished it, and
that a second birth should take place and that the nourishment should be new
and suitable to the birth and thus the measure of perfection be attained.
Through His birth, that is, His incarnation, and baptism and passion and
resurrection, He delivered our nature from the sin of our first parent and death
and corruption, and became the first-fruits of the resurrection, and made
Himself the way and image and pattern, in order that we, too, following in His
footsteps, may become by adoption what He is Himself by nature<sup>14<a href="#_edn142" name="_ednref142" style="mso-endnote-id:edn142" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> , sons and heirs of God and joint

corruption, so also being born of Him we may be in His likeness and heirs<sup>14<a href="#_edn144" name="_ednref144" style="mso-endnote-id:edn144" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> of His incorruption and blessing

that both the birth and likewise the food should be spiritual too, but since we
are of a double and compound nature, it is meet that both the birth should be
double and likewise the food compound. We were therefore given a birth by water
and Spirit: I mean, by the holy baptism<sup>14<a href="#_edn145" name="_ednref145" style="mso-endnote-id:edn145" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>

from heaven<sup>14<a href="#_edn146" name="_ednref146" style="mso-endnote-id:edn146" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> .
For when He was about to take on Himself a voluntary death for our sakes, on
the night on which He gave Himself up, He laid a new covenant on His holy
disciples and apostles, and through them on all who believe on Him. In the
upper chamber, then, of holy and illustrious Sion, after He had eaten the
ancient Passover with His disciples and had fulfilled the ancient covenant, He
washed His disciples’ feet<sup>14<a href="#_edn147" name="_ednref147" style="mso-endnote-id:edn147" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
in token of the holy baptism. Then having broken bread He gave it to them
saying, <i>Take, eat, this is My body broken for you for the remission of sins</i><sup>14<a href="#_edn148" name="_ednref148" style="mso-endnote-id:edn148" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> . Likewise also He took the cup of
wine and water and gave it to them saying, <i>Drink ye all of it: for this is
My blood, the blood of the New Testament which is shed for you for the
remission of sins. This do ye in remembrance of Me. For as often as ye eat this
bread and drink this cup, ye do shew the death of the Son of man and confess
His resurrection until He come</i><sup>15<a href="#_edn149" name="_ednref149" style="mso-endnote-id:edn149" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>

said in the beginning, <i>Let the earth bring forth grass</i><sup>15<a href="#_edn155" name="_ednref155" style="mso-endnote-id:edn155" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> , and even until this present day,
when the rain comes it brings forth its proper fruits, urged on and
strengthened by the divine command. God said, <i>This is My body</i>, and <i>This
is My blood, and this do ye in remembrance of Me</i>. And so it is at His
omnipotent command <i>until He come:</i> for it was in this sense that He said
until He come: and the overshadowing power of the Holy Spirit becomes through
the invocation the rain to this new tillage<sup>15<a href="#_edn156" name="_ednref156" style="mso-endnote-id:

made by the energy of the Holy Spirit, so also now the energy of the Spirit
performs those things that are supernatural and which it is not possible to
comprehend unless by faith alone. <i>How shall this be</i>, said the holy
Virgin, <i>seeing I know not a man?</i> And the archangel Gabriel answered her:
<i>The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee</i><sup>15<a href="#_edn157" name="_ednref157" style="mso-endnote-id:edn157" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> .

man’s infirmity: for in general man turns away discontentedly from what is not
well-worn by custom: and so with His usual indulgence H e performs His
supernatural works through familiar objects: and just as, in the case of
baptism, since it is man’s custom to wash himself with water and anoint himself
with oil, He connected the grace of the Spirit with the oil and the water and
made it the water of regeneration, in like manner since it is man’s custom to
eat and to drink water and wine<sup>16<a href="#_edn159" name="_ednref159" style="mso-endnote-id:edn159" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>

But if you enquire how this happens, it is enough for you to learn that it was
through the Holy Spirit, just as the Lord took on Himself flesh that subsisted

nothing further save that the Word of God is true and energises and is

pre-ordained by the eternal prescient counsel of God and imaged forth and
proclaimed in diverse images and discourses of the prophets through the Holy

brother, of the tribe of Solomon, took his wife and raised up seed to his

from every secular and carnal desire, and thus keeping her soul as well as her
hotly virginal, as was meet for her who was to receive God into her bosom: for
as He is holy, He finds rest among the holy<sup>20<a href="#_edn201" name="_ednref201" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn201" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> . Thus, therefore, she strove
after holiness, and was declared a holy and wonderful temple fit for the most
high God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Moreover, since the enemy of our salvation was
keeping a watchful eye on virgins, according to the prophecy of Isaiah, who
said, <i>Behold a virgin shall conceive and bare a Son and shall call His name
Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, ‘God with us</i><sup>20<a href="#_edn202" name="_ednref202" style="mso-endnote-id:edn202" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> ,’ in order that <i>he who taketh
the wise in their own craftiness</i><sup>20<a href="#_edn203" name="_ednref203" style="mso-endnote-id:edn203" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup>
may deceive him who always glorieth in his wisdom, the maiden is given in
marriage to Joseph by the priests, a new book to him who is versed in letters<sup>20<a href="#_edn204" name="_ednref204" style="mso-endnote-id:edn204" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> : but the marriage was both the
protection of the virgin and the delusion of him who was keeping a watchful eye
on virgins. But when the fulness of time was come, the messenger of the Lord
was sent to her, with the good news of our Lord’s conception. And thus she
conceived the Son of God, the hypostatic power of the Father, <i>not of the
will of the flesh nor of the will of man</i><sup>20<a href="#_edn205" name="_ednref205" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn205" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> , that is to say, by connection
and seed, but by the good pleasure of the Father and co-operation of the Holy
Spirit. She ministered to the Creator in that He was created, to the Fashioner
in that He was fashioned, and to the Son of God and God in that He was made
flesh and became man from her pure and immaculate flesh and blood, satisfying
the debt of the first mother. For just as the latter was formed from Adam
without connection, so also did the former bring forth the new Adam, who was
brought forth in accordance with the laws of parturition and above the nature
of generation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">For He who was of the Father, yet without mother, was
born of woman without a father’s co-operation. And so far as He was born of
woman, His birth was in accordance with the laws of parturition, while so far
as He had no father, His birth was above the nature of generation: and in that
it was at the usual time (for He was born on the completion of the ninth month
when the tenth was just beginning), His birth was in accordance with the laws
of parturition, while in that it was painless it was above the laws of
generation. For, as pleasure did not precede it, pain did not follow it,
according to the prophet who says, <i>Before she travailed, she brought forth,
and again, before her pain came she was delivered of a man-child</i><sup>20<a href="#_edn206" name="_ednref206" style="mso-endnote-id:edn206" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . The Son of God incarnate,
therefore, was born of her, not a divinely-inspired<sup>20<a href="#_edn207" name="_ednref207" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn207" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> man but God incarnate not a
prophet anointed with energy but by the presence of the anointing One in His
completeness, so that the Anointer became man and the Anointed God, not by a
change of nature but by union in subsistence. For the Anointer and the Anointed
were one and the same, anointing in the capacity of God Himself as man. Must
there not therefore be a Mother of God who bore God incarnate? Assuredly she
who played the part of the Creator’s servant and mother is in all strictness
and truth in reality God’s Mother and Lady and Queen over all created things.
But just as He who was conceived kept her who conceived still virgin, in like
manner also He who was born preserved her virginity intact, only passing
through her and keeping her closed<sup>20<a href="#_edn208" name="_ednref208" style="mso-endnote-id:edn208" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
. The conception, indeed, was through the sense of hearing, but the birth
through the usual path by which children come, although some tell tales of His
birth through the side of the Mother of God. For it was not impossible for Him
to have come by this gate, without injuring her seal in anyway.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The ever-virgin One thus remains even after the birth
still virgin, having never at any time up till death consorted with a man. For
although it is written, <i>And knew her not till she had brought forth her
first-born Son</i><sup>21<a href="#_edn209" name="_ednref209" style="mso-endnote-id:edn209" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> ,
yet note that he who is first-begotten is first-born even if he is
only-begotten. For the word “first-born” means that he was born first but does
not at all suggest the birth of others. And the word “till” signifies the limit
of the appointed time but does not exclude the time thereafter. For the Lord
says, <i>And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world</i><sup>21<a href="#_edn210" name="_ednref210" style="mso-endnote-id:edn210" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> , not meaning thereby that He will
be separated from us after the completion of the age. The divine apostle,
indeed, says, <i>And so shall we ever be with the Lord</i><sup>21<a href="#_edn211" name="_ednref211" style="mso-endnote-id:edn211" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> , meaning after the general
resurrection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">For could it be possible that she, who had borne God
and from experience of the subsequent events had come to know the miracle,
should receive the embrace of a man. God forbid! It is not the part of a chaste
mind to think such thoughts, far less to commit such acts</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">But this blessed woman, who was deemed worthy of
gifts that are supernatural, suffered those pains, which she escaped at the
birth, in the hour of the passion, enduring from motherly sympathy the rending
of the bowels, and when she beheld Him, Whom she knew to be God by the manner
of His generation, killed as a malefactor, her thoughts pierced her as a sword,
and this is the meaning of this verse: <i>Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy
own saul also</i><sup>21<a href="#_edn212" name="_ednref212" style="mso-endnote-id:edn212" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> <sup>21<a href="#_edn213" name="_ednref213" style="mso-endnote-id:edn213" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> .

transforms the pain, proclaiming Him, Who died in the flesh, to be God.</p>

sons and heirs of God: in the words of John the theologian and evangelist, <i>As
many as received Him, to them gave He power to became sons of God</i><sup>21<a href="#_edn214" name="_ednref214" style="mso-endnote-id:edn214" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup><i> . So that they are no longer

Lord of all things is called also King of Kings and Lord of Lords<sup>21<a href="#_edn218" name="_ednref218" style="mso-endnote-id:edn218" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> and God of Gods, surely also the
saints are gods and lords and kings. For of these God is and is called God and
Lord and King. <i>For I am the God of Abraham</i>, He said to Moses, <i>the God
of Isaac and the God of Jacob</i><sup>22<a href="#_edn219" name="_ednref219" style="mso-endnote-id:edn219" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>

. Now I mean gods and kings and lords not in nature, but as rulers and masters
of their passions, and as preserving a truthful likeness to the divine image
according to which they were made (for the image of a king is also called
king), and as being united to God of their own free-will and receiving Him as
an indweller and becoming by grace through participation with Him what He is
Himself by nature. Surely, then, the worshippers and friends and sons of God
are to be held in honour? For the honour shewn to the most thoughtful of
fellow-servants is a proof of good feeling towards the common Master<sup>22<a href="#_edn221" name="_ednref221" style="mso-endnote-id:edn221" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> .<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

The divine Scripture likewise saith that the souls of the just are in God’s
hand<sup>22<a href="#_edn223" name="_ednref223" style="mso-endnote-id:edn223" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> and death cannot
lay hold of them. For death is rather the sleep of the saints than their death.
<i>For they travailed in this life and shall to the end</i><sup>22<a href="#_edn224" name="_ednref224" style="mso-endnote-id:edn224" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> , and <i>Precious in the sight of

the Apostle tells us, saying, Know ye not that your bodies are the temples of

honour to the living temples of God, the living tabernacles of God. These while
they lived stood with confidence before God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

be fountains of salvation to us, pouring forth manifold blessings and abounding
in oil of sweet fragrance: and let no one disbelieve this<sup>23<a href="#_edn230" name="_ednref230" style="mso-endnote-id:edn230" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> . For if water burst in the desert

is it incredible that fragrant oil should burst forth from the martyrs’

honour which He accords His saints.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

considered impure<sup>23<a href="#_edn233" name="_ednref233" style="mso-endnote-id:edn233" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> ,
but these are not dead. For from the time when He that is Himself life and the
Author of life was reckoned among the dead, we do not call those dead who have
fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and in faith on Him. For how
could a dead body work miracles? How, therefore, are demons driven off by them,
diseases dispelled, sick persons made well, the blind restored to sight, lepers
purified, temptations and troubles overcome, and how does every good gift from
the Father of lights<sup>23<a href="#_edn234" name="_ednref234" style="mso-endnote-id:edn234" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
come down through them to those who pray with sure faith? How much labour would
you not undergo to find a patron to introduce you to a mortal king and speak to
him on your behalf? Are not those, then, worthy of honour who are the patrons
of the whole race, and make intercession to God for us? Yea, verily, we ought
to give honour to them by raising temples to God in their name, bringing them
fruit-offerings, honouring their memories and taking spiritual delight in them,
in order that the joy of those who call on us may be ours, that in our attempts
at worship we may not on the contrary cause them offence. For those who worship
God will take pleasure in those things whereby God is worshipped, while His
shield-bearers will be wrath at those things wherewith God is wroth. In psalms

most worshipped in such wise. Let us raise monuments to them and visible
images, and let us ourselves become, through imitation of their virtues, living
monuments and images of them. Let us give honour to her who bore God as being
strictly and truly the Mother of God. Let us honour also the prophet John as
forerunner and baptist<sup>23<a href="#_edn237" name="_ednref237" style="mso-endnote-id:edn237" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> ,

, as saith the Lord, and he became the first to proclaim the Kingdom. Let us
honour the apostles as the Lord’s brothers, who saw Him face to face and
ministered to His passion, <i>for whom God the Father did foreknow He also did
predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son</i><sup>24<a href="#_edn239" name="_ednref239" style="mso-endnote-id:edn239" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup><i> , first apostles, second

. Let us also honour the martyrs of the Lord chosen out of every class, as
soldiers of Christ who have drunk His cup and were then baptized with the
baptism of His life-bringing death, to be partakers of His passion and glory:
of whom the leader is Stephen, the first deacon of Christ and apostle and first
martyr. Also let us honour our holy fathers, the God-possessed ascetics, whose
struggle was the longer and more toilsome one of the conscience: <i>who
wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented; they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of
the earth, of whom the world was not worthy</i><sup>24<a href="#_edn242" name="_ednref242" style="mso-endnote-id:

prophets before grace, the patriarchs anti just men who foretold the Lord’s coming.
Let us carefully review the life of these men, and let us emulate their faith<sup>24<a href="#_edn243" name="_ednref243" style="mso-endnote-id:edn243" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> and love and hope and zeal and way

find fault with us for worshipping and honouring the image of our Saviour and
that of our Lady, and those, too, of the rest of the saints and servants of
Christ, let them remember that in the beginning God created man after His own
image<sup>24<a href="#_edn246" name="_ednref246" style="mso-endnote-id:edn246" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . On what grounds,
then, do we shew reverence to each other unless because we are made after God’s
image? For as Basil, that much-versed expounder of divine things, says, the
honour given to the image passes over to the prototype<sup>24<a href="#_edn247" name="_ednref247" style="mso-endnote-id:edn247" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> . Now a prototype is that which is
imaged, from which the derivative is obtained. Why was it that the Mosaic
people honoured on all hands the tabernacle<sup>24<a href="#_edn248" name="_ednref248" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn248" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> which bore an image and type of
heavenly things, or rather of the whole creation? God indeed said to Moses, <i>Look
that thou make them after their pattern which was shewed thee in the mount</i><sup>25<a href="#_edn249" name="_ednref249" style="mso-endnote-id:edn249" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> . The Cherubim, too, which o’ershadow
the mercy seat, are they not the work of men’s hands<sup>25<a href="#_edn250" name="_ednref250" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn250" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> ? What, further, is the celebrated
temple at Jerusalem? Is it not hand-made and fashioned by the skill of men<sup>25<a href="#_edn251" name="_ednref251" style="mso-endnote-id:edn251" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ?<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Moreover the divine Scripture blames those who
worship graven images, but also those who sacrifice to demons. The Greeks
sacrificed and the Jews also sacrificed: but the Greeks to demons and the Jews
to God. And the sacrifice of the Greeks was rejected and condemned, but the
sacrifice of the just was very acceptable to God. For Noah sacrificed, and <i>God
smelled a sweet savour</i><sup>25<a href="#_edn252" name="_ednref252" style="mso-endnote-id:edn252" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
, receiving the fragrance of the right choice and good-will towards Him. And so
the graven images of the Greeks, since they were images of deities, were rejected
and forbidden.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">But besides this who can make an imitation of the
invisible, incorporeal, uncircumscribed, formless God? Therefore to give form
to the Deity is the height of folly and impiety. And hence it is that in the
Old Testament the use of images was not common. But after God<sup>25<a href="#_edn253" name="_ednref253" style="mso-endnote-id:edn253" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> in His bowels of pity became in
truth man for our salvation, not as He was seen by Abraham in the semblance of
a man, nor as He was seen by the prophets, but in being truly man, and after He
lived upon the earth and dwelt among men<sup>25<a href="#_edn254" name="_ednref254" style="mso-endnote-id:edn254" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
, worked miracles, suffered, was crucified, rose again and was taken back to
Heaven, since all these things actually took place and were seen by men, they
were written for the remembrance and instruction of us who were not alive at
that time in order that though we saw not, we may still, hearing and believing,
obtain the blessing of the Lord. But seeing that not every one has a knowledge
of letters nor time for reading, the Fathers gave their sanction to depicting
these events on images as being acts of great heroism, in order that they
should form a concise memorial of them. Often, doubtless, when we have not the
Lord’s passion in mind and see the image of Christ’s crucifixion, His saving passion
is brought back to remembrance, and we fall down and worship not the material
but that which is imaged: just as we do not worship the material of which the
Gospels are made, nor the material of the Cross, but that which these typify.
For wherein does the cross, that typifies the Lord, differ from a cross that
does not do so? It is just the same also in the case of the Mother of the Lord.
For the honour which we give to her is referred to Him Who was made of her
incarnate. And similarly also the brave acts of holy men stir us up to be brave
and to emulate and imitate their valour and to glorify God. For as we said, the
honour that is given to the best of fellow-servants is a proof of good-will
towards our common Lady, and the honour rendered to the image passes over to
the prototype<sup>25<a href="#_edn255" name="_ednref255" style="mso-endnote-id:edn255" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> .

Cross, and very many other similar things.</p>

was king over the city of the Edessenes, he sent a portrait painter to paint a
likeness of the Lord, and when the painter could not paint because of the
brightness that shone from His countenance, the Lord Himself put a garment over
His own divine and life-giving face and impressed on it an image of Himself and
sent this to Augarus, to satisfy thus his desire.</p>

saith the Lord, <i>not to destroy life law but to fulfil it</i><sup>26<a href="#_edn263" name="_ednref263" style="mso-endnote-id:edn263" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> . For He Himself worked out our
salvation for which all Scripture and all mystery exists. And again, <i>Search
the Scriptures for they are they that testify of Me</i><sup>26<a href="#_edn264" name="_ednref264" style="mso-endnote-id:edn264" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> . And the Apostle says, <i>God,
Who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers

. Wherefore to search the Scriptures is a work most fair and most profitable
for souls. For just as the tree planted by the channels of waters, so also the
soul watered by the divine Scripture is enriched and gives fruit in its season<sup>26<a href="#_edn267" name="_ednref267" style="mso-endnote-id:edn267" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> , viz. orthodox belief, and is
adorned with evergreen leafage, I mean, actions pleasing to God. For through
the Holy Scriptures we are trained to action that is pleasing to God, and
untroubled contemplation. For in these we find both exhortation to every virtue
and dissuasion from every vice. If, therefore, we are lovers of learning, we
shall also be learned in many things. For by care and toil and the grace of God
the Giver, all things are accomplished. <i>For every one that asketh receiveth,

very fair garden of the Scriptures, so fragrant and sweet and blooming, with
its varied sounds of spiritual and divinely-inspired birds ringing all round
our ears, laying hold of our hearts, comforting the mourner, pacifying the
angry and filling him with joy everlasting: which sets our mind on the
gold-gleaming, brilliant back of the divine dove<sup>27<a href="#_edn269" name="_ednref269" style="mso-endnote-id:

but rather zealously and constantly: lest knocking we grow weary. For thus it
will be opened to us. If we read once or twice and do not understand what we
read, let us not grow weary, but let us persist, let us talk much, let us
enquire. For <i>ask thy Father</i>, he saith, <i>and He will shew thee: thy
elders and they will tell thee</i><sup>27<a href="#_edn272" name="_ednref272" style="mso-endnote-id:edn272" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>

revel insatiate: for the Scriptures possess inexhaustible grace. But if we are
able to pluck anything profitable from outside sources, there is nothing to
forbid that. Let us become tried money-dealers, heaping up the true and pure
gold and discarding the spurious. Let us keep the fairest sayings but let us
throw to the dogs absurd gods and strange myths: for we might prevail most
mightily against them through themselves.</p>

, that there are two and twenty books of the Old Testament, one for each letter
of the Hebrew tongue. For there are twenty-two letters of which five are
double, and so they come to be twenty-seven. For the letters Caph, Mere, Nun,
Pe<sup>27<a href="#_edn276" name="_ednref276" style="mso-endnote-id:edn276" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> , Sade are double.
And thus the number of the books in this way is twenty-two, but is found to be
twenty-seven because of the double character of five. For Ruth is joined on to
Judges, and the Hebrews count them one book: the first and second books of
Kings are counted one: and so are the third and fourth books of Kings: and also
the first and second of Paraleipomena: and the first and second of Esdra. In
this way, then, the books are collected together in four Pentateuchs and two
others remain over, to form thus the canonical books. Five of them are of the
Law, viz. Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. This which is the
code of the Law, constitutes the first Pentateuch. Then comes another
Pentateuch, the so-called Grapheia<sup>27<a href="#_edn277" name="_ednref277" style="mso-endnote-id:edn277" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
, or as they are called by some, the Hagiographa, which are the following:
Jesus the Son of Nave<sup>27<a href="#_edn278" name="_ednref278" style="mso-endnote-id:edn278" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> ,
Judges along with Ruth, first and second Kings, which are one book, third and
fourth Kings, which are one book, and the two books of the Paraleipomena<sup>28<a href="#_edn279" name="_ednref279" style="mso-endnote-id:edn279" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> which are one book. This is the
second Pentateuch. The third Pentateuch is the books in verse, viz. Job,
Psalms, Proverbs of Solomon, Ecclesiastes of Solomon and the Song of Songs of
Solomon. The fourth Pentateuch is the Prophetical books, viz the twelve
prophets constituting one book, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel. Then come
the two books of Esdra made into one, and Esther<sup>28<a href="#_edn280" name="_ednref280" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn280" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> . There are also the Panaretus,
that is the Wisdom of Solomon, and the Wisdom of Jesus, which was published in
Hebrew by the father of Sirach, and afterwards translated into Greek by his
grandson, Jesus, the Son of Sirach. These are virtuous and noble, but are not
counted nor were they placed in the ark.</p>

modes. For some fit Him even before the incarnation, others in the union,
others after the union, and others after the resurrection. Also of those that

them declare the union of nature and the identity in essence with the Father,
as this, <i>I and My Father are one</i><sup>28<a href="#_edn283" name="_ednref283" style="mso-endnote-id:edn283" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup>

and so forth. Others declare the perfection of subsistence, as these, <i>Son of
God</i>, and <i>the Express Image of His person</i><sup>28<a href="#_edn286" name="_ednref286" style="mso-endnote-id:

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

Wisdom, Power, Effulgence. For the word is inseparably established in the mind
(and it is the essential mind that I mean), and so also is wisdom, and power in
him that is powerful, and effulgence in the light, all springing forth from
these<sup>29<a href="#_edn291" name="_ednref291" style="mso-endnote-id:edn291" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>And
others make known the fact of His origin from the Father as cause, for instance
<i>My Father is greater than I</i><sup>29<a href="#_edn292" name="_ednref292" style="mso-endnote-id:edn292" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
. For from Him He derives both His being and all that He has<sup>29<a href="#_edn293" name="_ednref293" style="mso-endnote-id:edn293" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> : His being was by generative and
not by creative means, as, <i>I came forth from the Father and am come</i><sup>29<a href="#_edn294" name="_ednref294" style="mso-endnote-id:edn294" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> , and <i>I live by the Father</i><sup>29<a href="#_edn295" name="_ednref295" style="mso-endnote-id:edn295" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> . But all that He hath is not His
by free gift or by teaching, but in a causal sense, as, <i>The Son can do
nothing of Himself but what He seeth the Father do</i><sup>29<a href="#_edn296" name="_ednref296" style="mso-endnote-id:edn296" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . For if the Father is not,
neither is the Son. For the Son is of the Father and in the Father and with the
Father, and not after<sup>29<a href="#_edn297" name="_ednref297" style="mso-endnote-id:edn297" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup>
the Father. In like manner also what He doeth is of Him and with Him. For there
is one and the same, not similar but the same, will and energy and power in the
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>

through His energy, and not as through an instrument or a servant, but as
through His essential and hypostatic Word and Wisdom and Power, because but one
action<sup>30<a href="#_edn299" name="_ednref299" style="mso-endnote-id:edn299" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> is observed in

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

some are in the future tense: for instance, <i>He shall come openly</i><sup>30<a href="#_edn303" name="_ednref303" style="mso-endnote-id:edn303" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> , and this from Zechariah, <i>Behold,

put in the past tense, as, for instance, <i>This is our God: Therefore He was
seen upon the earth and dwell among men</i><sup>30<a href="#_edn306" name="_ednref306" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn306" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> , and <i>The Lord created me in

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The things said, then, that refer to the period
before the union will be applicable to Him even after the union: but those that
refer to the period after the union will not be applicable at all before the
union, unless indeed in a prophetic sense, as we said. Those that refer to the
time of the union have three modes. For when our discourse dears with the
higher aspect, we speak of the deification of the flesh, and His assumption of
the Word and exceeding exaltation, and so forth, making manifest the riches
that are added to the flesh tram the union and natural conjunction with the
most high God the Word. And when our discourse deals with the lower aspect, we
speak of the incarnation of God the Word, His becoming man, His emptying of
Himself, His poverty, His humility. For these and such like are imposed upon
the Word and God through His admixture with humanity. When again we keep both
sides in view at the same time, we speak of union, community, anointing,
natural conjunction, conformation and the like. The former two modes, then,
have their reason in this third mode. For through the union it is made clear
what either has obtained from the intimate junction with and permeation through
the other. For through the union<sup>31<a href="#_edn309" name="_ednref309" style="mso-endnote-id:edn309" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>
in subsistence the flesh is said to be deified and to become God and to be
equally God with the Word; and God the Word is said to be made flesh, and to
become man, and is called creature and last<sup>31<a href="#_edn310" name="_ednref310" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn310" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> : not in the sense that the two
natures are converted into one compound nature (for it is not possible for the
opposite natural qualities to exist at the same time in one nature)<sup>31<a href="#_edn311" name="_ednref311" style="mso-endnote-id:edn311" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> , but in the sense that the two
natures are united in subsistence and permeate one another without confusion or
transmutation The permeation<sup>31<a href="#_edn312" name="_ednref312" style="mso-endnote-id:edn312" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
moreover did not come of the flesh but of the divinity: for it is impossible
that the flesh should permeate through the divinity: but the divine nature once
permeating through the flesh gave also to the flesh the same ineffable power of
permeation<sup>31<a href="#_edn313" name="_ednref313" style="mso-endnote-id:edn313" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> ;
and this indeed is what we call union.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Note, too, that in the case of the first and second
modes of those that belong to the period of the union, reciprocation is
observed. For when we speak about the flesh, we use the terms deification and
assumption of the Word and exceeding exaltation and anointing. For these are
derived from divinity, but are observed in connection with the flesh. And when
we speak about the Word, we use the terms emptying, incarnation, becoming man,
humility and the like: and these, as we said, are imposed on the Word and God
through the flesh. For He endured these things in person of His own free-will.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Of the things that refer to the period after the
union there are three modes. The first declares His divine nature, as, <i>I am
in the Father and the Father in Me</i><sup>31<a href="#_edn314" name="_ednref314" style="mso-endnote-id:edn314" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
, and <i>I and the Father are one</i><sup>31<a href="#_edn315" name="_ednref315" style="mso-endnote-id:edn315" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>
: and all those things which are affirmed of Him before His assumption of
humanity, these will be affirmed of Him even after His assumption of humanity,
with this exception, that He did not assume the flesh and its natural
properties.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The second declares His human nature, as, <i>Now ye
seek to kill Me, a man that hath told you the truth</i><sup>31<a href="#_edn316" name="_ednref316" style="mso-endnote-id:edn316" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> , and <i>Even so must the Son of
Man be lifted up</i><sup>31<a href="#_edn317" name="_ednref317" style="mso-endnote-id:edn317" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> ,
and the like.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Further, of the statements made and written about
Christ the Saviour after the manner of men, whether they deal with sayings or
actions, there are six modes. For some of them were done or said naturally in
accordance with the incarnation; for instance, His birth from a virgin, His
growth and progress with age, His hunger, thirst, weariness, fear, sleep,
piercing with nails, death and all such like natural and innocent passions<sup>31<a href="#_edn318" name="_ednref318" style="mso-endnote-id:edn318" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> . For in all these there is a
mixture of the divine and human, although they are held to belong in reality to
the body, the divine suffering none of these, but procuring through them our
salvation.</p>

man was He in need of these or similar things, but only because His form was
that of a man as necessity and expediency demanded<sup>32<a href="#_edn322" name="_ednref322" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn322" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> . For example, the praying was to
shew that He is not opposed to God, for He gives honour to the Father as the
cause of Himself<sup>32<a href="#_edn323" name="_ednref323" style="mso-endnote-id:edn323" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> :
and the question was not put in ignorance but to shew that He is in truth man
as well as God<sup>32<a href="#_edn324" name="_ednref324" style="mso-endnote-id:edn324" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> ;

up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

and relation<sup>32<a href="#_edn325" name="_ednref325" style="mso-endnote-id:edn325" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> ,
as, <i>My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me</i><sup>32<a href="#_edn326" name="_ednref326" style="mso-endnote-id:

was He ever forsaken by the Father, nor did He become sin or a curse, nor did
He require to be made subject to the Father. For as God He is equal to the
Father and not opposed to Him nor subjected to Him; and as God, He was never at
any time disobedient to His Begetter to make it necessary for Him to make Him
subject<sup>33<a href="#_edn331" name="_ednref331" style="mso-endnote-id:edn331" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> . Appropriating,
then, our person and ranking Himself with us, He used these words. For we are
bound in the fetters of sin and the curse as faithless and disobedient, and
therefore forsaken.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Others are said by reason of distinction in thought.
For if you divide in thought things that are inseparable in actual truth, to
cut the flesh from the Word, the terms ‘servant’ and ‘ignorant’ are used of
Him, for indeed He was of a subject and ignorant nature, and except that it was
united with God the Word, His flesh was servile and ignorant<sup>33<a href="#_edn332" name="_ednref332" style="mso-endnote-id:edn332" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> . But because of the union in
subsistence with God the Word it was neither servile nor ignorant. In this way,
too, He called the Father His God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

us and strengthening our faith, as, <i>And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with

is glorified, but His glory was not manifested nor confirmed to us. Also that
which the apostle said, <i>Declared to be the Son of God with power, according
to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead</i><sup>33<a href="#_edn334" name="_ednref334" style="mso-endnote-id:edn334" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> . For by the miracles and the
resurrection and the coming of the Holy Spirit it was manifested and confirmed
to the world that He is the Son of God<sup>33<a href="#_edn335" name="_ednref335" style="mso-endnote-id:edn335" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>

the personal life of the Jews, in numbering Himself among the Jews, as He saith
to the Samaritan woman, <i>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

after the resurrection some are suitable to God, as, <i>Baptizing them in the

as God; also this, <i>And lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the
world</i><sup>34<a href="#_edn344" name="_ednref344" style="mso-endnote-id:edn344" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> ,
and other similar ones. For He is with us as God. Others are suitable to man,
as, <i>They held Him by the feet</i><sup>34<a href="#_edn345" name="_ednref345" style="mso-endnote-id:edn345" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

Resurrection that are suitable to man there are different modes. For some did
actually take place, yet not according to nature<sup>34<a href="#_edn347" name="_ednref347" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn347" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> , but according to dispensation,
in order to confirm the fact that the very body, which suffered, rose again;
such are the weals, the eating and the drinking after the resurrection. Others
took place actually and naturally, as changing from place to place without
trouble and passing in through closed gates. Others have the character of
simulation<sup>34<a href="#_edn348" name="_ednref348" style="mso-endnote-id:edn348" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> ,
as, <i>He made as though He would have gone further</i><sup>35<a href="#_edn349" name="_ednref349" style="mso-endnote-id:edn349" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> . Others are appropriate to the
double nature, as, <i>I ascend unto My Father and your Father, and My God and
our God</i><sup>35<a href="#_edn350" name="_ednref350" style="mso-endnote-id:edn350" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> ,

understood as though He were ranking Himself with us, in the manner of
separation in pure thought, as, <i>My God and your God</i><sup>35<a href="#_edn353" name="_ednref353" style="mso-endnote-id:edn353" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> .</p>

divine nature, which is superior to passion and body: and those that are humble
must be ascribed to the human nature; and those that are common must be
attributed to the compound, that is, the one Christ, Who is God and man. And it
should be understood that both belong to one and the same Jesus Christ, our
Lord. For if we know what is proper to each, and perceive that both are
performed by one and the same, we shall have the true faith and shall not go
astray. And from all these the difference between the united natures is
recognised, and the fact<sup>35<a href="#_edn354" name="_ednref354" style="mso-endnote-id:edn354" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
that, as the most godly Cyril says, they are not identical in the natural
quality of their divinity and humanity. But yet there is but one Son and Christ
and Lord: and as He is one, He has also but one person, the unity in
subsistence being in nowise broken up into parts by the recognition of the
difference of the natures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;
text-autospace:none">It is to be observed<sup>35<a href="#_edn356" name="_ednref356" style="mso-endnote-id:edn356" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup>
that it is the custom in the Holy Scripture to speak of God’s permission as His
energy, as when the apostle says in the Epistle to the Romans, <i>Hath not the
potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and
another unto dishonour</i><sup>35<a href="#_edn357" name="_ednref357" style="mso-endnote-id:edn357" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup><i>
?</i> And for this reason, that He Himself makes this or that. For He is
Himself alone the Maker of all things; yet it is not He Himself that fashions
noble or ignoble things, but the personal choice of each one<sup>35<a href="#_edn358" name="_ednref358" style="mso-endnote-id:edn358" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> . And this is manifest from what
the same Apostle says in the Second Epistle to Timothy, <i>In a great house
there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth:
and some to honour and some to dishonour. If a man therefore purge himself from
these, he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified, and meet for the master’s
use, and prepared unto every good work</i><sup>36<a href="#_edn359" name="_ednref359" style="mso-endnote-id:edn359" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup>
. And it is evident that the purification must be voluntary: for <i>if a man</i>,
he saith, <i>purge himself.</i> And the consequent antistrophe responds, “If a
man purge not himself he will be a vessel to dishonour, unmeet for the master’s
use and fit only to be broken in pieces.” Wherefore this passage that we have
quoted and this, <i>God hath concluded them all in unbelief</i><sup>36<a href="#_edn360" name="_ednref360" style="mso-endnote-id:edn360" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> , and this, <i>God hath given them
the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should
not hear</i><sup>36<a href="#_edn361" name="_ednref361" style="mso-endnote-id:edn361" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> ,
all these must be understood not as though God Himself were energising, but as
though God were permitting, both because of free-will and because goodness
knows no compulsion.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">His permission, therefore, is usually spoken of in
the Holy Scripture as His energy and work. Nay, even when He says that <i>God
creates evil things</i>, and that <i>there is no evil in a city that the Lord
hath not done</i>, he does not mean by these words<sup>36<a href="#_edn362" name="_ednref362" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn362" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> that the Lord is the cause of
evil, but the word ‘evil<sup>36<a href="#_edn363" name="_ednref363" style="mso-endnote-id:edn363" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> ’
is used in two ways, with two meanings. For sometimes it means what is evil by
nature, and this is the opposite of virtue and the will of God: and sometimes
it means that which is evil and oppressive to our sensation, that is to say,
afflictions and calamities. Now these are seemingly evil because they are
painful, but in reality are good. For to those who understand they became
ambassadors of conversion and salvation. The Scripture says that of these God
is the Author.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">It is, moreover, to be observed that of these, too,
we are the cause: for involuntary evils are the offspring of voluntary ones<sup>36<a href="#_edn364" name="_ednref364" style="mso-endnote-id:edn364" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">This also should be recognised, that it is usual in
the Scriptures for some things that ought to be considered as effects to be
stated in a causal sense<sup>36<a href="#_edn365" name="_ednref365" style="mso-endnote-id:edn365" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> ,
as, <i>Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in Thy sight,
that Than mightest be justified when Thou speakest, and prevail when Thou
judgest</i><sup>36<a href="#_edn366" name="_ednref366" style="mso-endnote-id:edn366" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> .
For the sinner did not sin in order that God might prevail, nor again did God
require our sin in order that He might by it be revealed as victor<sup>36<a href="#_edn367" name="_ednref367" style="mso-endnote-id:edn367" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> . For above comparison He wins the
victor’s prize against all, even against those who are sinless, being Maker,
incomprehensible, uncreated, and possessing natural and not adventitious glory.
But it is because when we sin God is not unjust in His anger against us; and
when He pardons the penitent He is shewn victor over our wickedness. But it is
not for this that we sin, but because the thing so turns out. It is just as if
one were sitting at work and a friend stood near by, and one said, My friend
came in order that I might do no work that day. The friend, however, was not
present in order that the man should do no work, but such was the result. For
being occupied with receiving his friend he did not work. These things, too,
are spoken of as effects because affairs so turned out. Moreover, God does not
wish that He alone should be just, but that all should, so far as possible, be
made like unto Him.</p>

edn368" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> , one good and one bad, we shall
see from this. For good and evil are opposed to one another and mutually
destructive, and cannot exist in one another or with one another. Each of them,
therefore, in its own division will belong to the whole, and first<sup>37<a href="#_edn369" name="_ednref369" style="mso-endnote-id:edn369" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> they will he circumscribed, not by

to each its place. For they will not affirm that they have come to a friendly
agreement with, or been reconciled to, one another. For evil is not evil when
it is at peace with, and reconciled to, goodness, nor is goodness good when it
is on amicable terms with evil. But if He Who has marked off to each of these
its own sphere of action is something different from them, He must the rather
be God.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

they come in contact with and destroy one another, or that there exists some
intermediate place where neither goodness nor evil exists, separating both from
one another, like a partition. And so there will be no longer two but three kingdoms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

that they are at peace, which is quite incompatible with evil (for that which
is at peace is not evil), or they are at strife, which is incompatible with
goodness (for that which is at strife is not perfectly good), or the evil is at
strife and the good does not retaliate, but is destroyed by the evil, or they
are ever in trouble and distress<sup>37<a href="#_edn372" name="_ednref372" style="mso-endnote-id:edn372" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
, which is not a mark of goodness. There is, therefore, but one kingdom,
delivered from all evil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

evil should originate from goodness. We answer then, that evil is nothing else
than absence of goodness and a lapsing<sup>37<a href="#_edn374" name="_ednref374" style="mso-endnote-id:edn374" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
from what is natural into what is unnatural: for nothing evil is natural. For
all things, whatsoever God made, are very good<sup>37<a href="#_edn375" name="_ednref375" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn375" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> , so far as they were made: if,
therefore, they remain just as they were created, they are very good, but when
they voluntarily depart from what is natural and turn to what is unnatural,
they slip into evil.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">By nature, therefore, all things are servants of the
Creator and obey Him. Whenever, then, any of His creatures voluntarily rebels
and becomes disobedient to his Maker, he introduces evil into himself. For evil
is not any essence nor a property of essence, but an accident, that is, a
voluntary deviation from what is natural into what is unnatural, which is sin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

free-will of the devil. Is the devil, then, evil? In so far as he was brought
into existence he is not evil but good. For he was created by his Maker a
bright and very brilliant angel, endowed with free-will as being rational. But
he voluntarily departed from the virtue that is natural and came into the
darkness of evil, being far removed from God, Who alone is good and can give
life and light. For from Him every good thing derives its goodness, and so far
as it is separated from Him in will (for it is not in place), it falls into
evil.</p>

brought what exists into being out of nothing, and has foreknowledge of what
will exist in the future. If, therefore, they were not to exist in the future,
they would neither be evil in the future nor would they be foreknown. For
knowledge is of what exists and foreknowledge is of what will surely exist in
the future. For simple being comes first and then good or evil being. But if
the very existence of those, who through the goodness of God are in the future
to exist, were to be prevented by the fact that they were to become evil of
their own choice, evil would have prevailed over the goodness of God. Wherefore
God makes all His works good, but each becomes of its own choice good or evil.
Although, then, the Lord said, <i>Good were it for that man that he had never
been born</i><sup>38<a href="#_edn379" name="_ednref379" style="mso-endnote-id:edn379" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> ,
He said it in condemnation not of His own creation but of the evil which His
own creation had acquired by his own choice and through his own heedlessness.
For the heedlessness that marks man’s judgment made His Creator’s beneficence
of no profit to him. It is just as if any one, when he had obtained riches and
dominion from a king, were to lord it over his benefactor, who, when he has
worsted him, will punish him as he deserves, if he should see him keeping hold
of the sovereignty to the end.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

For that which God wishes is good. Moreover the precept, which teaches this, is
law, that we, holding by it, may walk in light<sup>38<a href="#_edn380" name="_ednref380" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn380" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> : and the transgression of this
precept is sin, and this continues to exist on account of the assault of the
devil and our unconstrained and voluntary reception of it<sup>38<a href="#_edn381" name="_ednref381" style="mso-endnote-id:edn381" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> .

towards itself and pricks our conscience. And our conscience, too, is called a
law of our mind. Further, the assault of the wicked one, that is the law of
sin, settling in the members of our flesh, makes its assault upon us through
it. For by once voluntarily transgressing the law of God and receiving the
assault of the wicked one, we gave entrance to it, being sold by ourselves to
sin. Wherefore our body is readily impelled to it. And so the savour and
perception of sin that is stored up in our body, that is to say, lust and
pleasure of the body, is law in the members of our flesh.</p>

, that is to say, the assault made through the law that is in our members, or
through the lust and inclination and movement of the body and of the irrational
part of the soul, is in opposition to the law of my mind, that is to
conscience, and takes me captive (even though I make the law of God my will and
set my love on it, and make not sin my will), by reason of commixture<sup>38<a href="#_edn384" name="_ednref384" style="mso-endnote-id:edn384" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> : and through the softness of
pleasure and the lust of the body and of the irrational part of the soul, as I
said, it leads me astray and induces me to become the servant of sin. But <i>what
the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His
own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh </i>(for He assumed flesh but not sin) <i>condemned
sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us

members. For the verse, <i>we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but

Israelites and their carnal love and propensity towards matter in everything,

take their ease from the distraction of material things, they may gather
together unto God, spending the whole of the seventh day in psalms and hymns
and spiritual songs and the study of the divine Scriptures and resting in God.
For when<sup>39<a href="#_edn393" name="_ednref393" style="mso-endnote-id:edn393" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup>
the law did not exist and there was no divinely-inspired Scripture, the Sabbath
was not consecrated to God. But when the divinely-inspired Scripture was given
by Moses, the Sabbath was consecrated to God in order that on it they, who do
not dedicate their whole life to God, and who do not make their desire
subservient to the as though to a Father, but are like foolish servants, may on
that day talk much concerning the exercise of it, and may abstract a small,
truly a most insignificant, portion of their life for the service of God, and
this from fear of the chastisements and punishments which threaten
transgressors. <i>For the law is not made for a righteous man but for the
unrighteous</i><sup>39<a href="#_edn394" name="_ednref394" style="mso-endnote-id:edn394" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> .
Moses, of a truth, was the first to abide fasting with God for forty days and
again for another forty<sup>39<a href="#_edn395" name="_ednref395" style="mso-endnote-id:edn395" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> ,
and thus doubtless to afflict himself with hunger on the Sabbaths although the
law forbade self-affliction on the Sabbath. But if they should object that this
took place before the law, what will they say about Elias the Thesbite who
accomplished a journey of forty days on one meal<sup>39<a href="#_edn396" name="_ednref396" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn396" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> ? For he, by thus afflicting
himself on the Sabbaths not only with hunger but with the forty days’
journeying, broke the Sabbath: and yet God, Who gave the law, was not wroth
with him but shewed Himself to him on Choreb as a reward for his virtue. And
what will they say about Daniel? Did he not spend three weeks without food<sup>39<a href="#_edn397" name="_ednref397" style="mso-endnote-id:edn397" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> ? And again, did not all Israel
circumcise the child on the Sabbath, if it happened to be the eighth day after
birth<sup>39<a href="#_edn398" name="_ednref398" style="mso-endnote-id:edn398" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> ? And do they not

if an ox should fall into a pit on the Sabbath, he who draws it forth is
blameless, while he who neglects to do so is condemned<sup>40<a href="#_edn401" name="_ednref401" style="mso-endnote-id:edn401" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> . And did not all the Israelites
compass the walls of Jericho bearing the Ark of God for seven days, in which
assuredly the Sabbath was included<sup>40<a href="#_edn402" name="_ednref402" style="mso-endnote-id:edn402" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

, therefore, for the purpose of securing leisure to worship God in order that
they might, both servant and beast of burden, devote a very small share to Him
and be at rest, the observance of the Sabbath was devised for the carnal that
were still childish and <i>in the bonds of the elements of the world</i><sup>40<a href="#_edn404" name="_ednref404" style="mso-endnote-id:edn404" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> , and unable to conceive of
anything beyond the body and the letter. <i>But when the fulness of the time
was come, God sent forth His Only-begotten Son, made of a woman, made under the
law, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption
of sons</i><sup>40<a href="#_edn405" name="_ednref405" style="mso-endnote-id:edn405" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup><i>

but under grace: no longer do we serve God in part from fear, but we are bound
to dedicate to Him the whole span of our life, and cause that servant, I mean
wrath and desire, to cease from sin and bid it devote itself to the service of
God, always directing our whole desire towards God and arming our wrath against
the enemies of God: and likewise we hinder that beast of burden, that is the
body, from the servitude of sin, and urge it forwards to assist to the
uttermost the divine precepts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

Christ enjoins on us and those who observe that become superior to the law of
Moses. <i>For when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away</i><sup>40<a href="#_edn408" name="_ednref408" style="mso-endnote-id:edn408" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> :
and when the covering of the law, that is, the veil, is rent asunder through
the crucifixion of the Saviour, and the Spirit shines forth with tongues of
fire, the letter shall be done away with, bodily things shall come to an end,
the law of servitude shall be fulfilled, and the law of liberty be bestowed on
us. Yea<sup>41<a href="#_edn409" name="_ednref409" style="mso-endnote-id:edn409" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> we shall celebrate
the perfect rest of bureau nature, I mean the day after the resurrection, on
which the Lord Jesus, the Author of Life and our Saviour, shall lead us into
the heritage promised to those who serve God in the spirit, a heritage into
which He entered Himself as our forerunner after He rose from the dead, and
whereon, the gates of Heaven being opened to Him, He took His seat in bodily
form at the right hand of the Father, where those who keep the spiritual law
shall also come.</p>

edn410" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> , therefore, who walk by the
spirit and not by the letter, is the complete abandonment of carnal things, the
spiritual service and communion with God. For circumcision is the abandonment
of carnal pleasure and of whatever is superfluous and unnecessary. For the
foreskin is nothing else than the skin which it superfluous to the organ of
lust. And, indeed, every pleasure which does not arise from God nor is in God
is superfluous to pleasure: and of that the foreskin is the type. The Sabbath,
moreover, is the cessation from sin; so that both things happen to be one, and
so both together, when observed by those who are spiritual, do not bring about
any breach of the law at all.</p>

that the number seven denotes all the present time, as the most wise Solomon
says, to give a portion to seven and also to eight<sup>41<a href="#_edn412" name="_ednref412" style="mso-endnote-id:

composed the eighth psalm, sang of the future restoration after the
resurrection from the dead. Since the Law, therefore, enjoined that the seventh
day should be spent in rest from carnal things and devoted to spiritual things,
it was a mystic indication to the true Israelite who had a mind to see God,
that he should through all time offer himself to God and rise higher than
carnal things.</p>

But we, made confident by God the Word that was made flesh of the Virgin,
answer that virginity was implanted in man’s nature from above and in the
beginning. For man was formed of virgin soil. From Adam alone was Eve created.
In Paradise virginity held sway. Indeed, Divine Scripture tells that <i>both
Adam and Eve were naked and were not ashamed</i><sup>41<a href="#_edn416" name="_ednref416" style="mso-endnote-id:

themselves<sup>41<a href="#_edn417" name="_ednref417" style="mso-endnote-id:edn417" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> .

out and destruction of the race by death, marriage was devised that the race of

But God, Who knoweth all things before they have existence, knowing in His
foreknowledge that they would fall into transgression in the future and be
condemned to death, anticipated this and made “male and female,” and bade them
“be fruitful and multiply.” Let us, then, proceed on our way and see the
glories<sup>42<a href="#_edn425" name="_ednref425" style="mso-endnote-id:edn425" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> of virginity: and

themselves and so approach the temple’s shrine and offer victims? And did not
the law call chastity the great vow?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">The precept of the law, therefore, is to be taken in
a more spiritual sense. For there is spiritual seed which is conceived through
the love and fear of God in the spiritual womb, travailing and bringing forth
the spirit of salvation. And in this sense must be understood this verse: <i>Blessed
is he who hath seed in Zion and posterity in Jerusalem.</i> For does it mean
that, although he be a whoremonger and a drunkard and an idolater, he is still
blessed if only he hath seed in Sion and posterity in Jerusalem? No one in his
senses will say this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Virginity is the rule of life among the angels, the
property of all incorporeal nature. This we say without speaking ill of
marriage: God forbid! (for we know that the Lord blessed marriage by His
presence<sup>43<a href="#_edn436" name="_ednref436" style="mso-endnote-id:edn436" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> ,
and we know him who said, <i>Marriage is and the bed undefiled</i><sup>43<a href="#_edn437" name="_ednref437" style="mso-endnote-id:edn437" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> ), but knowing that virginity is
better than marriage, however good. For among the virtues, equally as among the
vices, there are higher and lower grades. We know that all mortals after the
first parents of the race are the offspring of marriage. For the first parents
were the work of virginity and not of marriage. But celibacy is, as we said, an
imitation of the angels. Wherefore virginity is as much more honourable than
marriage, as the angel is higher than man. But why do I say angel? Christ
Himself is the glory of virginity, who was not only-begotten of the Father
without beginning or emission or connection, but also became man in our image,
being made flesh for our sakes of the Virgin without connection, and
manifesting in Himself the true and perfect virginity. Wherefore, although He
did not enjoin that on us by law (for as He said, <i>all men cannot receive
this saying</i><sup>43<a href="#_edn438" name="_ednref438" style="mso-endnote-id:edn438" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup>
), yet in actual fact He taught us that and gave us strength for it. For it is
surely clear to every one that virginity now is flourishing among men.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

not permit the madness of desire to he caromed into unlawful acts. Good is
marriage for those who have no continence: but that virginity is better which
increases the fruitfulness of the soul and offers to God the seasonable fruit
of prayer. <i>Marriage is honourable and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers

was given to Abraham before the law, after the blessings, after the promise, as
a sign separating him and his offspring and his household from the Gentiles
with whom he lived<sup>44<a href="#_edn443" name="_ednref443" style="mso-endnote-id:edn443" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup> .
And this is evident<sup>44<a href="#_edn444" name="_ednref444" style="mso-endnote-id:edn444" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup> ,
for when the Israelites passed forty years alone by themselves in the desert,
having no intercourse with any other race, all that were horn in the desert
were uncircumcised: but when Joshua<sup>44<a href="#_edn445" name="_ednref445" style="mso-endnote-id:edn445" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>
led them across Jordan, they were circumcised, and a second law of circumcision
was instituted. For in Abraham’s time the law of circumcision was given, and
for the forty years in the desert it fell into abeyance. And again for the
second time God gave the law of Circumcision to Joshua, after the crossing of
Jordan, according as it is written in the book of Joshua, the son of Nun: <i>At
that time the Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of stone from the sharp
rock, and assemble and circumcise the sons of Israel a second time</i><sup>44<a href="#_edn446" name="_ednref446" style="mso-endnote-id:edn446" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> ; and a little later: <i>For the
children of Israel walked forty and two</i><sup>44<a href="#_edn447" name="_ednref447" style="mso-endnote-id:

Battaris</i><sup>44<a href="#_edn448" name="_ednref448" style="mso-endnote-id:edn448" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup><i>
, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
uncircumcised, because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord: unto whom the
Lord sware that He would not shew them the goad land, which the Lord swore unto
their fathers that He would give them, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
And their children, whom He raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised:
for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way</i><sup>45<a href="#_edn449" name="_ednref449" style="mso-endnote-id:edn449" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> . So that the circumcision was a
sign, dividing Israel from the Gentiles with whom they dwelt.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

does not cut off a useful member of the body but only a useless superfluity, so
by the holy baptism we are circumcised from sin, and sin clearly is, so to
speak, the superfluous part of desire and not useful desire. For it is quite
impossible that any one should have no desire at all nor ever experience the
taste of pleasure. But the useless part of pleasure, that is to say, useless
desire and pleasure, it is this that is sin from which holy baptism circumcises
us, giving us as a token the precious cross on the brow, not to divide us from
the Gentiles (for all the nations received baptism and were sealed with the
sign of the Cross), but to distinguish in each nation the faithful from the
Faithless. Wherefore, when the truth is revealed, circumcision is a senseless
figure and shade. So circumcision is now superfluous and contrary to holy
baptism. <i>For he who is circumcised is a debtor to do the whole law</i><sup>45<a href="#_edn451" name="_ednref451" style="mso-endnote-id:edn451" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup> . Further, the Lord was
circumcised that He might fulfil the law: and He fulfilled the whole law and
observed the Sabbath that He might fulfil and establish the law<sup>45<a href="#_edn452" name="_ednref452" style="mso-endnote-id:edn452" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> . Moreover after He was baptized
and the Holy Spirit had appeared to men, descending on Him in the form of a
dove, from that time the spiritual service and conduct of life and the Kingdom
of Heaven was preached.</p>

will be in truth, there will be, a resurrection of the dead, and by
resurrection we mean resurrection of bodies<sup>47<a href="#_edn475" name="_ednref475" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn475" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup> . For resurrection is the second
state of that which has fallen. For the souls are immortal, and hence how can
they rise again? For if they define death as the separation of soul and body,
resurrection surely is the re-union of soul and body, and the second state of
the living creature that has suffered dissolution and downfall<sup>47<a href="#_edn476" name="_ednref476" style="mso-endnote-id:edn476" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . It is, then, this very body,
which is corruptible and liable to dissolution, that will rise again
incorruptible. For He, who made it in the beginning of the sand of the earth,
does not lack the power to raise it up again after it has been dissolved again
and returned to the earth from which it was taken, in accordance with the
reversal of the Creator’s judgment.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

and enjoyment. If there is no resurrection, wherein do we differ from the
irrational brutes? If there is no resurrection, let us hold the wild beasts of
the field happy who have a life free from sorrow. If there is no resurrection,
neither is there any God nor Providence, but all things are driven and borne
along of themselves. For observe how we see most righteous men suffering hunger
and injustice and receiving no help in the present life, while sinners and
unrighteous men abound in riches and every delight. And who in his senses would
take this for the work of a righteous judgment or a wise providence? There must
be, therefore, there must be, a resurrection. For God is just and is the
rewarder of those who submit patiently to Him. Wherefore if it is the soul
alone that engages in the contests of virtue, it is also the soul alone that
will receive the crown. And if it were the soul alone that revels in pleasures,
it would also be the soul alone that would be justly punished. But since the
soul does not pursue either virtue or vice separate from the body, both
together will obtain that which is their just due.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:

your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at
the hand of every man’s brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth

I man</i><sup>47<a href="#_edn478" name="_ednref478" style="mso-endnote-id:edn478" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> .
How will He require the blood of man at the hand of every beast, unless because
the bodies of dead men will rise again? For not for man will the beasts die.</p>

even after he had been dead four days, and was stinking<sup>48<a href="#_edn487" name="_ednref487" style="mso-endnote-id:edn487" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> . For He did not raise the soul
without the body, but the body along with the soul: and not another body but
the very one that was corrupt. For how could the resurrection of the dead man
have been known or believed if it had not been established by his
characteristic properties? But it was in fact to make the divinity of His own
nature manifest and to confirm the belief in His own and our resurrection, that
He raised up Lazarus who was destined once more to die. And the Lord became
Himself the first-fruits of the perfect resurrection that is no longer subject
to death Wherefore also the divine Apostle Paul said: <i>If the dead rise not,
then is not Christ raised. And if Christ be not raised, our faith is vain: we
are jet in our sins</i><sup>48<a href="#_edn488" name="_ednref488" style="mso-endnote-id:edn488" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> .
And, <i>Now, is Christ risen from the dead and become the first-fruits of them
that slept</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn489" name="_ednref489" style="mso-endnote-id:edn489" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> ,
<i>and the first-born from the dead</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn490" name="_ednref490" style="mso-endnote-id:edn490" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup>
; and again, <i>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn491" name="_ednref491" style="mso-endnote-id:edn491" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup><i> . Even so</i>, he said, <i>as
Christ rose again.</i> Moreover, that the resurrection of the Lord was the
union of uncorrupted body and soul (for it was these that had been divided) is
manifest: for He said, <i>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
it up</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn492" name="_ednref492" style="mso-endnote-id:edn492" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup> .
And the holy Gospel is a trustworthy witness that He spoke of His own body. <i>Handle
Me and see</i>, the Lord said to His own disciples when they were thinking that
they saw a spirit, <i>that it is I Myself, and that I am not changed</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn493" name="_ednref493" style="mso-endnote-id:edn493" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup><i> : for a spirit hath not flesh
or bones, as ye see Me have</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn494" name="_ednref494" style="mso-endnote-id:edn494" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
. And when He had said this He shewed them His handsand His side, and stretched
them forward for Thomas to touch<sup>49<a href="#_edn495" name="_ednref495" style="mso-endnote-id:edn495" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>
. Is not this sufficient to establish belief in the resurrection of bodies?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">Again the divine apostle says, <i>For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn496" name="_ednref496" style="mso-endnote-id:edn496" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> . And again: <i>It is sown in
corruption, it is raised in incorruption: it is sawn in weakness, it is raised
in power: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is sown a natural
body</i> (that is to say, crass and mortal), <i>it is raised a spiritual body</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn497" name="_ednref497" style="mso-endnote-id:edn497" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">8</span></a></sup> , such as was our Lord’s body
after the resurrection which passed through closed doors, was unwearying, had
no need of food, or sleep, or drink. <i>For they will be</i>, saith the Lord, <i>as
the angels of God</i><sup>49<a href="#_edn498" name="_ednref498" style="mso-endnote-id:edn498" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">9</span></a></sup> :
there will no longer be marriage nor procreation of children. The divine
apostle, in truth, says, <i>For our conversation is in heaven, from whence</i> <i>also
we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus, Who shall change our vile body that it
may be fashioned like unto His glorious body</i><sup>50<a href="#_edn499" name="_ednref499" style="mso-endnote-id:
edn499" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">0</span></a></sup> : not meaning change into another
form (God forbid!), but rather the change from corruption into incorruption<sup>50<a href="#_edn500" name="_ednref500" style="mso-endnote-id:edn500" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">1</span></a></sup> .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">But some one will say, <i>How are the dead raised up?</i>
Oh, what disbelief! Oh, what folly! Will He, Who at His solitary will changed
earth into body, Who commanded the little drop of seed to grow in the mother’s
womb and become in the end this varied and manifold organ of the body, not the
rather raise up again at His solitary will that which was and is dissolved? <i>And
with what body do they come</i><sup>50<a href="#_edn501" name="_ednref501" style="mso-endnote-id:edn501" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">2</span></a></sup><i>
? Thou fool</i>, if thy hardness will not permit you to believe the words of
God, at least believe His works<sup>50<a href="#_edn502" name="_ednref502" style="mso-endnote-id:edn502" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">3</span></a></sup>
. <i>For that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die</i><sup>50<a href="#_edn503" name="_ednref503" style="mso-endnote-id:edn503" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">4</span></a></sup><i> . And that which thou sowest,
thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat
or of some other grain. But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to
every seed his own body</i><sup>50<a href="#_edn504" name="_ednref504" style="mso-endnote-id:edn504" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">5</span></a></sup>
. Behold, therefore, how the seed is buried in the furrows as in tombs. Who is
it that giveth them roots and stalk and leaves and ears and the most delicate
beards? Is it not the Maker of the universe? Is it not at the bidding of Him
Who hath contrived all things? Believe, therefore, in this wise, even that the
resurrection of the dead will come to pass at the divine will and sign. For He
has power that is able to keep pace with His will.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:
none;text-autospace:none">We shall therefore rise again, our souls being once
more united with our bodies, now made incorruptible and having put off
corruption, and we shall stand beside the awful judgment-seat of Christ: and
the devil and his demons and the man that is his, that is the Antichrist and
the impious and the sinful, will be given over to everlasting fire: not
material fire<sup>50<a href="#_edn505" name="_ednref505" style="mso-endnote-id:edn505" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">6</span></a></sup>
like our fire, but such fire as God would know. But those who have done good
will shine forth as the sun with the angels into life eternal, with our Lord
Jesus Christ, ever seeing Him and being in His sight and deriving unceasing joy
from Him, praising Him with the Father and the Holy Spirit throughout the
limitless ages of ages<sup>50<a href="#_edn506" name="_ednref506" style="mso-endnote-id:edn506" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">7</span></a></sup> .
