<sup>419 </sup><i>Tr. in Ps. cxxxvii. 16</i>. Cf. <i>Trin. x. 55</i>, where he refuses to believe that it was with real sorrow that our Lord wept over Jerusalem, that godless and murdetous city. His tears were a dispensa-tion.</p>
<p><a name="P609_405594"></a>
<sup>420 </sup><i>Tr. in ps. xiv. 10</i>, <i>est enirn necessariurn plerumque mendacium, et nonnunquam falsitas utilis est</i>. The latter apparently refers to his second example.</p>
<p><a name="P610_406208"></a>
<sup>421 </sup><i>Hermas, Mand. iii. 3</i>, confesses to wholesale Iying; he had never heard that it was wrong. But the writer of the <i>Shepherd</i> does not represent his mouthpiece as a model of virtue. It is more significant that Tertullian, Pud. 19, classes breach of trust and lying among slight sins which may happen to anyone any day. This was in his strictest and most censorious period. There are grave difficulties in reconciling some of Cyprian's statements concerning his opponents with one another and with probability, but he has not ventured upon any general extenuation of the vice.</p>

<p><a name="P614_409501"></a>
<sup>424 </sup><i>Tr. in Ps. cxviii</i>., Nun, 13, 15. It is in this passage that Hilary gives his views most fully. His aneithesis is between <i>legitima</i> and <i>voluntaria</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P615_410441"></a>
<sup>425 </sup>l.c. Nun, 14, <i>Comm. in Matt, v. 2</i>. In the latter passage there is a piece of practical advice which shews that public fasts were generally recognised. Hilary tells his readers that they must not take literally our Lord's command to anoint themselves when they fast. If they do, they will render themselves conspicuous and ridiculous. The passage, <i>Comm. in Matt. xxvii. 5</i>, 6, on the parables of the Virgins with their lamps and of the Talents cannot be taken, as by Forster, as evidence that Hilary rejected the later doctrine of the supererogatory righteousness of the Saints. He is speaking of the impossibility of contemporaries conveying righteousness to one another in the present life, and his words have no bearing on that doctrine.</p>

<sup>449 </sup>Schwane, ii. 271, says, `Though we reject that part of it which attributes a natural impassibility to the body of Christ, yet Hilary's exposition presents one truth more clearly than the earlier Fathers had stated it, by giving to the doctrine of the representative satisfaction of Christ its reasonable explanation as a <i>free</i> service of satisfaction. He conceives rightly of the Lord's whole life on earth, with all its troubles and infirmities, as a sacrifice of free love on the part of the God-Man; it is only his closer definition of this sacrifice that is inaccurate.... Hilary lays especial stress upon the freedom of the Lord s acceptance of death.0' He quotes <i>Trin. x. 11</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P644_426297"></a>
<sup>450 </sup>He had evidently been long familiar with it (<i>Life, i. 155</i>), but the first mention of its use for missionary purposes is in 1862 (ib. I. 137). He began the translation into Arabic at Tunis in 1890, after his resignation of the bishopric of Lahore (ii. 333), but it seems doubtfill whether he was able to make any progress with it at Muscat. His biographer says nothing of the amount actually accomplished. </p>
<p><a name="P645_427385"></a>
<sup>451 </sup>For Bishop French's view of the importance of this doctrine, see his <i>Life, I. 84</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P647_430155"></a>
<sup>452 </sup>Compare Bishop Lightfoot' comprehensive words on Col. I. 20 The reconciliation of mankind implies `a restitution to a state from which they had fallen, or for which they were destined.0'</p>

<sup>1 </sup>Matt. xiii. 15 ff.</p>
<p><a name="P686_446468"></a>
<sup>2 </sup><i>Hosius</i>, bishop of Cordova in Spain, had been sent by Constantine to Alexandria at the outbreak of the Arian controversy. He had presided at the Council of Nicaea in 325, and had taken part in the Council of Sardinica in 343, when the Nicene Creed was reaffirmed. In his extreme old age he was forced with blows to accept this extreme Arian Creed drawn up at the third Council of Sirmium in the summer of 357. This is what is stated by Socrates, and it is corroborated by Athanasius, <i>Hist. Arian</i>, c. 45, where it is added that he anathematized Arianism before dying. Hilary certainly does Hosius an injustice in deeclaring him to be joint-author of the `blasphemous0' creed.</p>
