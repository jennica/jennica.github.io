<sup>103 </sup><i>Chron.</i> ii. 45.</p>
<p><a name="P246_181215"></a>
<sup>104 </sup>Jerome, <i>Apol. adv. Rufinum,</i> i, 2 says that the total length of the Commentaries on Job and the Psalms was about 40,000 lines, i.e. Virgilian hexameters. The latter, at a tough estimate, must be nearly 35,000 lines in its present state. But Jerome, as we shall see, was not acquainted with so many Homilies as have come down to us; we must deduct about 5,000 lines, and this will leave l0,000 for the Commentary on Job, making it two sevenths of the length of the other. Jerome, however, is not careful in his statements of lengths; he calls the short <i>De Synodis</i> `a very long book0' Ep. v. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P248_182592"></a>
<sup>105 </sup><i>Tractatus</i> ought to be translated thus. It is the term, and the only term. Used so early as this for the bishop's address to the congregation; in fact, one might almost say that <i>tractare, tractatus</i> in Christian language had no other meaning. It is an anachtonism in the fourth century to render <i>praedicare</i> `preach ;0' cf. Duchesne, <i>Liber Pontificalis, i. 126</i>. </p>
<p><a name="P249_183803"></a>
<sup>106 </sup>E.g. <i>fundamen</i>, Tr. in Ps. cxxviii. 10, <i>germen</i>, cxxxiv. 1, <i>revolubilis</i>, ii. 23 <i>peccamen</i>, ii. 9 <i>fin</i>., and often. The shape of sentences though simple is always good; to take one test word, <i>saepe</i>, which was almost if not quite extinct in common use, occurs fairly often near the end of a period, where it was needed for rhythm, which <i>frequenter</i> would have spoiled. Some Psalms, e.g. xiii., xiv., are treated more rhetorically than others.</p>
<p><a name="P251_185101"></a>
<sup>107 </sup>Psalm li. is the only exception, due, no doubt, to careless transcription. The Homilies on the titles of Psalms ix. and xci. do not count; they are probably spurious, and in any case are incomplete, as the text of the Psalms is not discussed.</p>
<p><a name="P253_186279"></a>
<sup>108 </sup>So Zingerle, Preface, p. xiv, to whom we owe the excellent Vienna Edition of the Homilies, the only part of Hilary's writing which has as yet appeared in a critical text. The writer of the former of these two Homilies, in § 2, says that the title of a Psalm always corresponds to the contents. This is quite contrary to Hilary's teaching, who frequently points out and ingeniously explains what seem to him, to be discrepancies. </p>
<p><a name="P255_189850"></a>
<sup>109 </sup>E.g. in the <i>Instruction</i> or discourse preparatory to the Homilies, and in the introductory sections of that on Ps. 118 (119).</p>
<p><a name="P256_190494"></a>
<sup>110 </sup>E.g. <i>Instr. in Ps</i>., § 12, the fifty days of rejoicing during which Christians must not prostrate themselves in prayer, nor fast.</p>
<p><a name="P257_190885"></a>
<sup>111 </sup>Ps. 118, Ain., § 16.</p>
<p><a name="P259_191676"></a>
<sup>112 </sup>The account of exorcism given on Ps. 64, § 10, suggests Cyptian, Ad. Don. 5, but the subject is such a commonplace that nothing definite can be said. </p>
<p><a name="P261_193650"></a>
<sup>113 </sup>He is here cited by the volume and page of the edition by Lommatzsch. His system of interpretation is admirably described in the fourth of Dr. Bigg's Bampton Lectures, <i>The Christian Platonists of Alexandria</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P263_196230"></a>
<sup>114 </sup>Hil. Tr. in Ps. 13, § 3, <i>his igitur ita grassantibus</i>, sq. = Origen (ed. Lommatzsch) xii. 38.</p>
<p><a name="P264_196406"></a>
<sup>115 </sup>E.g. Instr. in Ps., § 15 = Origen in Eusebius, H. E. vi. 25 (Philocalia 3), Hilary on Ps. 51, §§ 3, 7 = Origen xii. 353, 354, and very often on Ps. 118 (119), e.g. the Introduction = Or. xiii. 67 f. Aleph, § 12 = ib. 70. Beth, § 6 = ib. 71, Caph, §§ 4, 9 = ib. 82, 83, &amp;c </p>
<p><a name="P265_197489"></a>
<sup>116 </sup><i>Hares. 64, 12</i> f.</p>
<p><a name="P266_197541"></a>
<sup>117 </sup>Origen xiii. 134, Hilary has omitted this from his Homily on Ps. 134, § 12.</p>
<p><a name="P267_198235"></a>
<sup>118 </sup>Instances of such independence are Ps. 118, <i>Daleth</i>, § 6 (xiii. 74), 119, § 15 (ib. 108), 122, § 2 (ib. 112), 133, § 3 (ib. 131). The references to Origen are in brackets.</p>
<p><a name="P268_199124"></a>
<sup>119 </sup>E.g. Ps. 118, Heth, § 10, 121, § 1; Origen xiii. 80, 111.</p>
<p><a name="P270_200418"></a>
<sup>120 </sup>Ps. 118, Gimel, § 21.</p>
<p><a name="P271_200745"></a>
<sup>121 </sup>Origen xiii. 72; Hilary, Ps. 118, Gimel, § 1.</p>
<p><a name="P272_201025"></a>
<sup>122 </sup>Cf. also Ps. 118, Heth, § 7, Koph, § 4, with Origen xiii. 79, 98. Here again the spirit of independence manifests itself towards the end of the work.</p>
<p><a name="P273_201379"></a>
<sup>123 </sup>Cf. Ps. 118, Samech, § 6 Origen xiii. 92. </p>
<p><a name="P274_201592"></a>
<sup>124 </sup>Ps. 143, § 4; Origen xiii. 149.</p>
<p><a name="P277_205101"></a>
<sup>125 </sup><i>Vir. Ill. 100</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P278_205653"></a>
<sup>126 </sup>J. F. Gamurrini, <i>S. Hilarii Tractatus de Mysteriis et Hymni</i>, etc., 4to., Rome, 1887. The <i>De Mysteriis</i> occupies pp 3 - 28. </p>
<p><a name="P279_207009"></a>
<sup>127 </sup>Ed. Gamurrini, p. 5.</p>
<p><a name="P280_207139"></a>
<sup>128 </sup>ib. p. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P281_207364"></a>
<sup>129 </sup>ib. p. 21; there is the not uncommon play on the two senses of <i>colligere</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P282_207737"></a>
<sup>130 </sup>ib. p. 27.</p>
<p><a name="P283_207974"></a>
<sup>131 </sup>It must be confessed that some authorities refuse to regard this work as the <i>De Mysteriis</i> of Hilary. Among these is Ebert, <i>Litteratur des Mittelaiters, p. 142</i>, who admits that the matter might be Hilary's, but denies that the manner and style are his.</p>
<p><a name="P285_209558"></a>
<sup>132 </sup><i>Comm. in Ep. ad Gal. ii. pref</i>.: <i>Hilarius in hymnorum carmine Gallos indociles vocat</i>. This may mean that Hilary actually used the words `stubborn Gauls0' in one of his hymns. There would be nothing extraordinary in this; the early efforts, and especially those of the Arians which Hilary imitated for a better purpose, often departed widely from the propriety of later compositions, as we shall see in one of those attributed to Hilary himself.</p>
<p><a name="P286_210129"></a>
<sup>133 </sup>It is true that the Fourth Council of Toledo (a.d. 633) in its 13th canon couples Hilary with Ambrose as the writer of hymns in actual use. But these canons are verbose productions, and this may be a mere literary flourish, natural enough in countrymen and contemporaries of Isidore of Seville, who knew, no doubt from Jerome's <i>Viri Illustres</i>, that Hilary was the first Latin hymn writer. </p>
<p><a name="P289_213919"></a>
<sup>134 </sup>Two of the simplest stanzas are as follows:- Extra qualm caper potent Flex quid potuit fidemens humana res tantas penitusmanet Filius in Patre, credulus assequi,rursus quem penes sit Pater ut incorporeo ex Deodignus, qui genitus est profectus fueritFilius in Deum. primogenitus Dei.It is written in stanzas of six lines in the ms.; the metre is the second Asclepiad. Gammurrini, the discoverer, and Fechtrup (in Wetzer Welte's Encyclopaedia) regard it as the work of Hilary. but the weight of opinion is against them. </p>
<p><a name="P291_215566"></a>
<sup>135 </sup>By Gamurrini in <i>Studi e documenti, 1884, p. 83</i> f.</p>
<p><a name="P292_218079"></a>
<sup>136 </sup>Printed in full by Mai, Patrum <i>Nova Bibliotheca, p. 490</i>. He suspends judgment, and will not say that it is unworthy of Hilary. The Benedictine editor, Coustant, gives a few stanzas as specimens, and summarily rejects it.</p>
<p><a name="P293_218581"></a>
<sup>137 </sup>The four quarters of the universe are <i>ortus, occasus, aquilo, septentrio</i>; one of these last must mean the south. This would point to some German land as the home of the author; in no country of Romance tongue could such an error have been perpetrated. <i>Perire</i> is used for <i>perdere</i>, but this is not unparalleled.</p>
<p><a name="P294_219324"></a>
<sup>138 </sup>In Mai's <i>Patrum Nova Bibliotheca</i>, vol. i., is a short treatise on the Genealogies of Christ. The method of interpretation is the same as Hilary's, but the language is not his; and the terms used of the Virgin in §§ 11, 12, are not as early as the fourth century. In the same volume is an exposition of the beginning of St. John's Gospel in an anti-Arian sense. In spite of some difference of vocabulary, there is no strong reason why this should not be by Hilary; cf. especially, §§ 5-7. Mai also prints in the same volume a short fragment on the Paralytic (St. Matt. ix.2), too brief for a judgment to be formed. In Pitra's <i>Spicilegium Solesmense</i>, vol. i., is a brief discussion on the first chapters of Genesis, dealing chiefly with the Fall. It appears, like the Homilies on the Psalms, to be the report of some extemporary addresses, and is more likely than any of the preceding to be the work of Hilary. It is quite in his style, but the contents are unimportant. But we must remember that the scribes were rarely content to confess that they were ignorant of the name author whom they transcribed; and that, being as ill-furnished with scruples as with imagination, they assigned everything that came to hand to a few fandliar names. Two further works ascribed to Hilary are obviously not his. Pitra, in the volunme of an already cited. has printed considerable remains of a Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, which really belongs to Theodore of Mopsuestia; and a Commentary on the seven Canonical Epistles, recently published in the <i>Spicilegium Casinense</i>, vol iii., is there attributed,with much reason,to his namesake of Arles.  </p>
<p><a name="P296_226233"></a>
<sup>139 </sup><i>Contra Auxentium, §7</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P297_226846"></a>
<sup>140 </sup>It is clear from Hilary's account (<i>Contra Auxentium. §7</i>) that the decision lay with the laymen. Auxentius, in his account of the matter, does not even mention the bishops.  </p>
<p><a name="P299_234032"></a>
<sup>141 </sup>This was a gross exaggeration. They cannot have been more than 400, and probably were less and we must remember that the Homoean decision was only obtained by fraud, as Auxentius well knew.  </p>
