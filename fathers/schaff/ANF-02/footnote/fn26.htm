<sup>7 </sup>[The reader is already acquainted ( ) with permissive canons, by which bishops might commend to their brethren, books fit to be read, which they sent, authenticated, not only by hand and seal, but by a clerical messenger whose duty it was (in the language of Bingham) "to go on the bishop's embassies, with his letters or messages to foreign churches; for in those days, by reason of the persecutions, a bishop did not so much as send a letter to a foreign church, but by the hands of one of his clergy. Whence Cyprian calls them literaeclericae." <i>Antiquities</i>, book iii. cap. ii. 3.] </p>

<sup>10 </sup>[I am glad that our learned translator makes nothing of the statement of Photius, that one of the works of Clement (now lost) contained many things unworthy of his orthodoxy and piety; but it may be well to say here, that Photius himself suggests that heretics had corrupted some of his writings, and that his genuine works testify against these very corruptions. Dupin thinks that if Clement ever wrote such things they much have crept into his works from fragments of his earlier writings, while he was a mere Platonist, at most an inquirer into Christianity. But his great repute in the Catholic Church after his decease, is sufficient to place his character far above all suspicions of his having ever swerved from the "faith of the Church."] </p>

<sup>1 </sup>The Greek is <font face="SPIonic">u9perta/thn</font>, lit. highest. Potter appeals to the use of <font face="SPIonic">u9e/rteroj</font> in Sophocles, <i>Electr</i>. 455, in the sense of <i>stronger</i>, as giving a clue to the meaning here. The scholiast in Klotz takes the words to mean that the hand is held over them.</p>
