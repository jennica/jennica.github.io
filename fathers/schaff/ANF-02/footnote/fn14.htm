<p><a name="P1404_406168"></a>
<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Eu!xrhstoj</font>, punning on the name <i>Christian</i>. [Comp cap xii., <i>infra</i>. So Justin, p. 164, vol. i., this series. But he also puns on his own name, "beloved of God," in the text <font face="SPIonic">forw= to\ Qeofile\j o!noma tou=to, k.t.l.</font>.]</p>
<p><a name="P1408_406712"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Literally, "your man;" the invisible soul, as the noblest pat of man, being probably intended.</p>
<p><a name="P1409_407651"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The techincal word for a disease of the eye, like cataract. </p>
<p><a name="P1413_409910"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>The translation here follows the Hamburg editor, others read, "If Father, I say everything."</p>
<p><a name="P1414_410234"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Maranus observes that Theophilus means to indicate the difference between God's chastisement of the righteous and His punishment of the wicked.</p>
<p><a name="P1418_411589"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>[Kaye's <i>Justin</i>, p. 173.]</p>
<p><a name="P1422_412762"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The reference here is not to the Holy Spirit, but to that vital power which is supposed to be diffused thorughout the universe. Comp. book ii. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P1426_413786"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>Literally, "propagation." </p>
<p><a name="P1427_414770"></a>

<sup>12 </sup>Ps xxxiii. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P1436_418765"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>i.e., in the resurrection. </p>
<p><a name="P1443_420672"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>[Foot-baths. A reference to Amasis, and his story in Heredotus, ii. 172. See Rawlinson's <i>Version and Notes</i>, vol. ii. p. 221, <i>ed. Appletons</i>, 1859. See also Athanagoras, <i>infra, Embassy</i>, cap. xxvi.]</p>
<p><a name="P1444_420897"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>[The fable of Echo and her shameful gossip may serve for an example.]</p>
<p><a name="P1448_423241"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>Prov. xxiv. 21, 22. The Greek of Theophilus has "honour" instead of "fear."</p>
<p><a name="P1452_423495"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>"The argumentation of this chapter depends on the literal meaning which Theophilus attaches to <i>Christos</i>, the Anointed One; and he plays on this meaning, and also on the similarity of pronunciation between <font face="SPIonic">xrhsto/j</font>, `useful,_0' and <font face="SPIonic">xristo/j</font>, `anointed._0'"-Donaldson.</p>
<p><a name="P1453_424413"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>[Not material oil probably, for it is not mentioned in such Scriptures as Acts viii. 17, xix 6, Heb. vi. 2; but the anointing (1 John ii. 20) of the Holy Ghots. As a symbol, oil was used at an early period, however; and the Latins are not slow to press this in favour of material oil in the <i>chrism</i>, or confirmation.]</p>
<p><a name="P1457_424848"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>[This is the famous challenge which affords Gibbon (cap. xv.) a most pleasing opportunity for his cavils. But our author was not asserting that the dead was raised in his day, but only that they should be at the las day.] </p>
<p><a name="P1461_427735"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>[Ps. cxix. 130. Note this tribute to the inspired Scriptures and their converting power; I might almost say their sacramental energy, referring to John vi. 63.]</p>
<p><a name="P1462_428937"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>[Rev. xix. 10. I cannot reconcile what Scripture says of itself with the modern <i>refinements</i> as to the human and divine element, while fully admitting that there are such elements, intermixed and interpenetrated mutually, beyond all power of dissection by us. I prefer the childlike docility of the Fathers.]</p>
<p><a name="P1463_429600"></a>
<sup>22 </sup>Rom. ii. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P1464_429813"></a>

<p><a name="P1465_430114"></a>
<sup>24 </sup>Rom. ii. 8, 9. </p>
<p><a name="P1476_431489"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>The words "by some and placed in" are omitted in some editions, but occur in the best mss.. </p>
<p><a name="P1488_435277"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>This is according to the Benedictine reading: the reading of Wolf, "nature is left to itself," is also worthy of consideration.</p>
<p><a name="P1489_435996"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>That is, the existence of God as sole first principle.</p>
<p><a name="P1490_436410"></a>
