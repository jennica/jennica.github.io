<sup>89 </sup>We have adopted the reading of Wolf in the text. The reading of the mss.. is, "He who desires to learn should desire to learn." Perhaps the most satisfactory emendation if that of Heumann, who reads <font face="SPIonic">filomuqei=n</font> instead of <font face="SPIonic">filomaqei=n</font>: "He who desires to learn should also desire to discuss subjects, and hold conversations on them." In this case, Theophilus most probably borrows his remark from Aristotle, <i>Metaphysic</i>. i. c. 2. </p>

<sup>7 </sup>As this sentence cannot be intelligibly rendered without its original in Plato, we subjoin the latter: "As for those youths who excel either in war or other pursuits, they ought both to have other rewards and prizes given them; and specially this, of being allowed the freest intercourse with women, that, at the same time, under this pretext the greatest number of children may spring from such parents."</p>
