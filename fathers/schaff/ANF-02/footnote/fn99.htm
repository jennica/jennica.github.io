133 <sup>1<font> </font></sup>[M. Aurelius Cassiodorus (whose name is also Senator) was an author and public man of the sixth century, and a very voluminous writer. He would shine with a greater lustre were he not so nearly lost in the brighter light of BoÃ«thius, his illustrious contemporary. After the death of his patron, Theodoric, he continued for a time in the puiblic service, and in high positions, but, at seventy years of age, began another career, and for twenty years devoted himself to letters and the practice of piety in a monastery which he established in the Neopolitan kingdom, near his native Squillace. Died about a.d.. 560.]</p>

134 <sup>2<font> </font></sup>Comments, i.e., <i>Adumbrationes</i>. Cassiodorus says that he had in his translation corrected what he considered erroneous in the original. So Fell states: and he is also inclined to believe that these fragments are from Clement's lost work, the <font face="SPIonic">'Upotupw/seij</font>, of which he believes <i>The Adumbratiounes</i> of Cassiodorus to be a translation.</p>
