<sup>6 </sup>[1 Pet. ii. 17. This claim for man <i>as man</i> is the inspiration of Christianity. Terence breathes it from his wounded soul in slavery; and his immortal line, "Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto" (<i>Haeuntontimor.</i>, act. i. sc. 1, verse 25), looks as if it had been written in the second century of illumination.]</p>

<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kata\ merismo/n</font>. Some translate, "by division," but the above is preferable. The sense, according to Otto, is that the Logos, having received a peculiar nature, shares in the <i>rational power</i> of the Father as a lighted torch partakes of the light of the torch from which it is kindled.

<sup>33 </sup>[Think of a Chaldean heathen, by the power of grace, thus transformed. <i>Sapiens solus liber</i>, but the Christian alone is <i>wise</i>. This chapter compares favourably with the eloquence of Chrysostom in his letter to Cyriac, which, if spurious, is made up of passages to be found elsewhere in his works.

<sup>36 </sup>Literally, "brought forth" or "forward." The word does not imply that matter was created by God.</p>
<p><a name="P1198_327614"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Tatian's words are somewhat obscure. We have given substantially the opinion of Worth, as expressed in his translation. The sense is: The body is evidently a unity in its organization and its activity, and the ultimate end which is serves in creation is that with which it is occupied, yet there are differences in respect of the parts. Otto renders: " For as the constitution of the body is of one plan, and in reference to the body the cause of its origin is occupied."</p>

<sup>38 </sup>[<i>Demons.</i> The Paris editors have a note here, bidding us to read with caution; as our author seems rashly to imagine the demons to be material creatures. p. 151, ed. 1615.]</p>
