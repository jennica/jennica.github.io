<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kata\ merismo/n</font>. Some translate, "by division," but the above is preferable.

<sup>33 </sup>[Think of a Chaldean heathen, by the power of grace, thus transformed. <i>Sapiens solus liber</i>, but the Christian alone is <i>wise</i>. This chapter compares favourably with the eloquence of Chrysostom in his letter to Cyriac, which, if spurious, is made up of passages to be found elsewhere in his works.

<p><a name="P1198_327614"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Tatian's words are somewhat obscure. We have given substantially the opinion of Worth, as expressed in his translation. The sense is: The body is evidently a unity in its organization and its activity, and the ultimate end which is serves in creation is that with which it is occupied, yet there are differences in respect of the parts. Otto renders: " For as the constitution of the body is of one plan, and in reference to the body the cause of its origin is occupied."</p>
