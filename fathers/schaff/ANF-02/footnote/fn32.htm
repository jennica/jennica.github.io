<sup>135 </sup><i>Odyss.</i>, xiii. 203.</p>
<p><a name="P3204_942177"></a>
<sup>136 </sup>A translation in accordance with the Latin version would run thus: "While a certain previous conception of divine power is nevertheless discovered within us." But adopting that in the text the argument is: there is unquestionably a providence implying the exertion of divine power. That power is not exercised by idols or heathen gods. The only other alternative is, that it is exercised by the one self-exitent God.</p>

<sup>139 </sup>The expression "conquered by brass or iron" is borrowed from Homer (<i>Il.</i>, viii. 534). Brass, or copper, and iron were the metals of which arms were made.</p>

<sup>152 </sup>[<i>Good will to men</i> made emphatic. Slavery already modified, free-schools established, and homes created. As soon as persecution ceased, we find the Christian hospital. Forster ascribes the first foundation of this kind to Ephraim Syrus. A friend refers me to his <i>Mohammedanism Unveiled</i>, vol. i. p. 283.] </p>

<sup>174 </sup>["Who is this that cometh from Edom," seems to be in mind. Isa. lxiii. 1.]</p>
<p><a name="P3273_973918"></a>
<sup>175 </sup>Clement here draws a distinction, frequently made by early Christian writers, between the image and the likeness of God. Man never loses the image of God; but as the likeness consists in moral resemblance, he may lose it, and he recovers it only when he becomes righteous, holy, and wise.</p>
<p><a name="P3274_974424"></a>
<sup>176 </sup>Ps. lxxxii. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P3280_974966"></a>
<sup>177 </sup>[Let me quote from an excellent author: "We ought to give the Fathers credit for knowing what arguments were best calculated to affect the minds of those whom they were addressing. It was unnecessary for them to establish, by a long train of reasoning, the <i>probability</i> that a revelation may be made from heaven to man, or to prove the credibility of miracles... The majority, both of the learned and unlearned, were fixed in the belief that the Deity exercised an immediate control over the human race, and consequently felt no predisposition to reject that which purported to be a communication of His will... . Accustomed as they were, however, to regard the various systems proposed by philosophers as matters of curious speculation, designed to exercise the understanding, <i>not to influence</i> the conduct, the chief difficulty of the advocate of Christianity was to prevent them from treating it <i>with the same levity</i>, and to induce them to view it in its true light as a revelation declaring truths of the highest practical importance."</p>
<p>This remark of Bishop Kaye is a hint of vast importance in our study of the early Apologists. It is taken from that author's <i>Account of the Writings of Clement of Alexandria </i>(London, 1835), to which I would refer the student, as the best introduction to these works that I know of. It is full of valuable comment and exposition I make only sparing reference to it, however, in these pages, as otherwise I should hardly know what to omit, or to include.] </p>

<sup>1 </sup>Ps. lxxiii. 1.</p>
<p><a name="P3295_977695"></a>

<p><a name="P3297_978653"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>The paedagogus. [This word seems to be used by Clement, with frequent alusion, at least, to its original idea, of one who leads the child to his instructor; which is the true idea, I suppose, in Gal. iii. 24.] </p>
