<sup>5 </sup>With an exclamation of surprise at the Latin translator giving a translation which is utterly unintelligible, Capperonn amends the text, substituting <font face="SPIonic">ou[ to/poj ou0dei\j tw=|</font>, etc., for ouj tovpo" oujdei;" tovpo" to; etc., and translates accordingly. The emendation is adopted, with the exception of the <font face="SPIonic">tw=|</font>, instead of which <font face="SPIonic">to/</font> is retained.</p>

<sup>7 </sup>We omit <font face="SPIonic">o#ti</font>, which the text has after <font face="SPIonic">dei/ch|</font>, which seems to indicate the omission of a clause, but as it stands is superfluous. The Latin translator retains it; and according to the rendering, the translation would be, "showed that He ceased."</p>

<sup>1 </sup>[The solemn words of our Lord about the perils of wealth and "the deceitfulness of riches" are much insisted on by Hermas, especially in the beautiful opening of the <i>Similitudes</i> (book iii.); and it seems remarkable, that, even in the age of martyrs and confessors, such warnings should have seemed needful. Clement is deeply impressed with the duty of enforcing such doctrine; and perhaps the germ of this very interesting essay is to be found in that eloquent passage in his <i>Stromata</i> (book ii. cap. 5, pp. 351, 352), to which the reader may do well to recur, using it as a preface to the following pages. Elucidation I.]</p>
