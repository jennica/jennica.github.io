<sup>107 </sup><font face="SPIonic">tw=n a'pokru/fwn</font><font>. The sense in which Cyril uses this term may be learned from Rufinus (<i>Expositio Symboli</i>, § 38), who distinguishes three classes of books: (1) The Canonical Books of the Old and New Testaments, which alone are to be used in proof of doctrine: (2) Ecclesiastical, which may be read in Churches, including Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, and the Books of the Maccabees, in the Old Testament, and <i>The Shepherd</i> of Hermas, and <i>The Two Ways</i> in the New Testament. (3) The other writings they called "Apocryphal," which they would not have read in Churches. The distinction is useful, though the second class is not complete.</font></p>
<p><a name="P630_140711"></a>
<sup>108 </sup><font>The The original source of this account of the Septuagint version is a letter purporting to have been written by Aristeas, or Aristaeus, a confidential minister of Ptolemy Philadelphus, to his brother Philocrates. Though the letter is not regarded as genuine its statements are in part admitted to be true, being confirmed by a fragment, preserved by Eusebius (<i>Praeparatio Evangelica</i>, ix. 6.), of a work of Aristobulus, a Jewish philosopher who wrote in the reign of Ptolemy Philometor, 181-146, B.C. Upon these testimonies it is generally admitted that "the whole Law," i.e. the Pentateuch was translated into Greek at Alexandria in the reign either of Ptolemy Soter (323-285, B.C.), or of his son Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-247, B.C.), under the direction of Demetrius Phalereus, curator of the King's library.</font></p>
<p><a name="P632_142661"></a>
<sup>109 </sup><font>Up to this point Cyril's account is based upon the statements of the Pseudo-Aristeas. The fabulous incidents which follow, concerning the separate cells, the completion of the whole version by each translator, the miraculous agreement in the very words, proving a Divine inspiration, are found in Philo Judaeus, <i>Life of Moses</i>, II. 7.. Josephus, <i>Antiquities</i>, XII. <i>c</i>. ii. 3-14, following the letter of Aristeas, gives long descriptions of the magnificent presents sent by Philadelphus to Jerusalem, and of his splendid hospitality to the translators, but makes no allusion to the separate cells or miraculous agreement. On the contrary he represents the 72 interpreters as meeting together for consultation, agreeing on the text to be adopted, and completing their joint labours in 72 days. The slightest comparison of the Version with the original Hebrew must convince any reasonable person that the idea of divine inspiration or supernatural assistance, borrowed by Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and other Fathers, apparently from Philo, is a mere invention of the imagination, disproved by the facts. Compare the article "Septuagint" in Murray's Dictionary of the Bible.</font></p>
<p><a name="P633_144162"></a>
<sup>110 </sup><font>The rendering "trench not" (R. W. C.) agrees well with the etymology of the verb (</font><font face="SPIonic">paraxara/ssw</font><font>). Its more usual signification seems to be "counterfeit," "forge." The sense required here, apart from any metaphor, is "transgress" (Heurtley).</font></p>
<p><a name="P634_144546"></a>
<sup>111 </sup><font>The name "Nun" is represented by "Nave" in the Septuagint, which Cyril used.</font></p>

<sup>112 </sup><font>The two books of Samuel.</font></p>
<p><a name="P637_145426"></a>
<sup>113 </sup><font>The Epistle of Jeremy, which now appears in the Apocrypha as the last chapter of Baruch. On the number and arrangement of the Books of the Old and New Testaments the student should consult an interesting Essay by Professor Sanday (<i>Studia Biblica</i>, vol.. iii.), who traces the introduction of a fixed order to the time when papyrus <i>rolls</i> were superseded by <i>codices</i>, in which the sheets of skin were folded and bound together, as in printed books. This change had commenced before the Diocletian persecution, A.D. 303, when among the sacred books taken from the Christians <i>codices</i> were much more numerous than <i>rolls</i>. On the contents of the Jewish Canon, see Dictionary of the Bible, "Canon." B. F. W. "Josephus enumerates 20 books `'which are justly believed to be divine.0'" One of the earliest attempts by a Christian to ascertain correctly the number and order of the Books of the O.T. was made by Melito, Bishop of Sardis, who travelled for this purpose to Palestine, in the latter part of the 2nd Century. His list is as follows: - "Of Moses five (books); Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Jesus son of Nave, Judges, Ruth, four Books of Kings, two of Chronicles, Psalms of David, Solomon's Proverbs, which is also called Wisdom, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Job, Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, the Twelve in one Book, Daniel, Ezekiel, Esdras." (Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> III. cap. 10, note I, in this s.) Cyril's List agrees with that of Athanasius (<i>Festal Epistle</i>, 373 A.D.), except that Job is placed by Ath. after Canticles instead of before Psalms.</font></p>

<p><a name="P640_148142"></a>
<sup>115 </sup><font>Cyril includes in this list all the books which we receive, except the Apocalypse. See Bishop Westcott's Article "Canon," in the <i>Dictionary of the Bible</i>, and Origen's Catalogue in Euseb. <i>Hist.</i> vi. 25 (Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, vol. i.).</font></p>

<p><a name="P657_150959"></a>
<sup>7 </sup><font>This sentence is a spurious addition to the text of the Septuagint, variously placed after Prov. xvii. 4, and xvii. 6. The thought is there completed by the antithesis, <i>but to the faithless not even an obol</i>. The origin of the interpolation is unknown.</font></p>

<sup>8 </sup><font>1 Tim. vi. 8.</font></p>
<p><a name="P660_151717"></a>
<sup>9 </sup><font>It was a common objection of Pagan philosophers that the Christian religion was not founded upon reason but only on faith.</font></p>
<p>Cyril's answer that faith is necessary in the ordinary affairs of life is the same which Origen had employed against Celsus (I. 11): "Why should it not be more reasonable, since all human affairs are dependent upon faith, to believe God rather than men? For who takes a voyage, or marries, or begets children, or casts seeds into the ground, without believing that better things will result, although the contrary might and sometimes does happen?" See also Arnobius, <i>adversus Gentes</i>, II. 8; and Hooker's allusion to the scornful reproach of Julian the Apostate, "The highest point of your wisdom is <i>believe</i>" (<i>Eccles. Pol.</i>. V. lxiii. 1.).</p>
<p><a name="P661_152572"></a>
<sup>10 </sup><font>By "aliens from the Church," and "those who are without," S. Cyril here means Pagans: so Tertullian, <i>de Idololatriâ</i>, c. xiv. But the latter term is applied to a Catechumen in Procatechesis. c. 12, and was also a common description of heretics: se Tertullian, <i>de Baptismo</i>, c. xv.</font></p>
