<sup>99 </sup><font face="SPIonic">h 9qeoto/koj</font><font> - <i>Deipara</i>. Gibbon (Chap. xlvii. 34) says, "It is not easy to fix the invention of this word, which La Croze (<i>Christianisme des Indes</i>, tom. i. p. 16) ascribes to Eusebius of Caesarea and the Arians. The orthodox testimonies are produced by Cyril (of Alexandris) and Petavius (<i>Dogmat. Theolog.</i> tom. v. L. v. cap. 15, p. 254, &amp;c.), but the veracity of the Saint is questionable, and the epithet of </font><font face="SPIonic">qeoto/koj</font><font> so easily slides from the margin to the text of a Catholic Ms." This passage is justly described as "Gibbon's calumny" by Dr. Newman: see his notes on the title </font><font face="SPIonic">Qeoto/koj</font><font> (<i>Athan. c. Arian. Or.</i> ii. cap. 12, n.; <i>Or</i>. iii. cap. 14, 29, 33). The word is certainly used by Origen (<i>Deut</i>. xxii. 13, Lommatzxch.

An eclipse of the sun was of course impossible, as the moon was full. Mr. J. R. Hind (<i>Historical Eclipses</i>, "Times," 19th July, 1872) states that the solar eclipse, mentioned by Phlegon the freedman of Hadrian, which occurred on Nov. 4, A.D. 29, and was partial at Jerusalem, is "the only solar eclipse that could have been visible at Jerusalem during the period usually fixed for the ministry of Christ." He adds, "The Moon was eclipsed on the generally received ate of the Crucifixion, 3 April, A.D. 33. I find she had emerged from the earth's dark shadow a quarter of an hour before she rose at Jerusalem (6:36 p. m.), but the penumbra continued upon her disc for an hour afterwards." Thus the "darkness from the sixth hour unto the ninth" cannot be explained as the natural effect of an eclipse either solar or lunar.</font></p>

He who is without beginning made the Son a beginning of things created."</font></p>
<p>It is important, therefore, to notice the sense in which Cyril here calls the Son <font face="SPIonic">a!narxoj</font>. The word has two meanings, which should be clearly distinguished, (I) <i>unorginate,</i> (ii) <i>without beginning in time</i>. The former referring to origin, or cause, can properly be applied to the One true God, or to God the Father only, as it is used by Clement of Alexandria (<i>Protrept</i>. cap. v. § 63: <font face="SPIonic">to\n pa/ntwn poihth\n. . . a'gnoou=ntej, to\n a!narxou qeo/n</font>. [<i>Strom</i>. IV. cap. xxv. § 164: <font face="SPIonic">o 9 Qeo\j de\ a!narxoj a'rxh\ tw=n o!lwn pantelh\j a'rxh=j poihtiko/j</font>]. [<i>Stromat</i>. V. cap. xiv. § 142: <font face="SPIonic">e'c a'rxh=j a'na/rxou</font>]. Methodius (<i>ob</i>. 312 A.D. <i>circ</i>) in a fragment (<i>On things created</i>, § 8, English Trans. Clark's Ante-Nic. Libr.) comments thus on Joh. i. 1-3: "And so after <i>the peculiar unbeginning beginning</i>, who is the Father, He (the Word) is the beginning of other things, `by whom all things are made.0'"</p>
<p>In this sense Cyril has said (iv. 4) that God alone is "unbegotten, unoriginate:" and in xi. 20 he explains this more fully, - "Suffer none to speak of a beginning of the Son in time (<font face="SPIonic">xr\ouikh\n a'rxh/n</font>), but as a timeless beginning acknowledge the Father. For the Father is the beginning of the Son, timeless incomprehensible, without beginning." From a confusion of the two meanings the word came to be improperly applied in the sense of "unoriginate" to the Son, and to the Spirit; and this improper usage is condemned in the 49th <i>Apostolic Canon</i>, which Hefele regards as amongst the most ancient Canons, and taken from the <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>, vi. 11: "If any Bishop or Presbyter shall baptize not according to our Lord's ordinance into the Father, and Son, and Spirit, but into <i>three Unoriginates</i>, or three Sons, or three Paracletes let him be deposed." (ii.) Athanasius frequently calls the Son <font face="SPIonic">a!narxoj</font> in the sense of `timeless,0'as being the co-eternal brightness (<font face="SPIonic">a'pau/lasma</font>) of the Eternal Light: see <i>de Sent. Dionys.</i> §§ 15, 16, 22; "God is the Eternal Light, which never either began or shall cease: accordingly the Brightness is ever before Him, and co-exists with Him, without beginning and ever-begotten (<font face="SPIonic">a!narxon kai\ a'eigene/j</font>)."</p>
