<sup>19 </sup><font>The reading of the earlier Editions </font><font face="SPIonic">u 9pe\r a'nqrw/pwn</font><font>is free from all difficulty, and so the more likely to have been substituted for what is at first sight more difficult </font><font face="SPIonic">u 9pe\r a3nqrwpon</font><font>, the reading of Cod. Coislin. adopted by the Benedictine and subsequent Editors. The idea of a super-human Priesthood to which the Son in His Divine nature was anointed by the Father from eternity is repeated by Cyril in ยง 14 of the Lecture, and in Cat. xi. 1, 14. See Index, "Priesthood," and the reference there given to a fuller consideration of the subject in the Introduction.</font></p>

<sup>21 </sup><font>John v. 27. Comparing what Cyril says here with Cat. iv. 15, and xv. 10, we see that he means to explain why Christ is called the "Son of Man" when "He cometh again from heaven," and "no more from earth." The preceding clause refers to His first coming in the flesh, as differing in the manner of His conception and birth from other men.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1165_307463"></a>
<sup>22 </sup><font>Cf. Athanas. (<i>c. Arian.</i> II. xv. 14), "That very Word who was by nature Lord, and was then made man, hath by means of a servant's form been made Lord of all and Christ."</font></p>
<p><a name="P1166_308046"></a>
<sup>23 </sup><font>Cf. Irenaeus (III. xvi. 8): "All therefore are outside the Dispensation, who under pretence of knowledge understand that Jesus was one, and Christ another, and the Only-begotten another (from whom again is the Word), and the Saviour another." The Cerinthians, Ebionites, Ophites, and Valentinians are mentioned by Irenaeus as thus separating the Christ from Jesus.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1168_308618"></a>
<sup>24 </sup><font>Cf. Athanas. (<i>Epist</i>. X.): "Since He is rich and manifold, He varies Himself according to the individual capacity of each soul."</font></p>
<p><a name="P1169_309068"></a>
<sup>25 </sup><font>1 Cor. ix. 22.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1170_309378"></a>
<sup>26 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e'k prokoph=j</font><font>. We learn from Athanasius (<i>c. Arian</i>. i. 37, 38, 40), that from St. Paul's language <i>Philipp</i>. ii. 9: "Wherefore also God highly exalted Him, &amp;c.," and from Ps. xlv. 7: "Thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows," the Arians argued that Christ first received Divine honour as Son and Lord as the reward of His obedience as Man. Athanasius replies (c. 40): "He was not from a lower state promoted; but rather, existing as God, He took the form of a servant, and in taking it was not promoted but humbled Himself. Where then is there here any reward of virtue, or what advancement (</font><font face="SPIonic">prokoph/</font><font>) and promotion in humiliation?"</font></p>
<p>The same doctrine had been previously held by the disciples of Paul of Samosata, who said that Christ was not originally God, but after His Incarnation was by advance (<font face="SPIonic">e'k prokoph=j</font>) made God, from being made by nature a mere man: se Athanas. (<i>de Decretis</i>, ยง 24, <i>c. Arian</i>. i. 38). S. Cyril refers to the error and uses the same word, in xi. 1, 7, 13, 15, 17, and xiv. 27.</p>
<p><a name="P1171_310564"></a>
<sup>27 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kataxrhstikw=j</font><font>, i.e. in a secondary or metaphorical sense. Cf. vii. 5.</font></p>

<sup>28 </sup><font face="SPIonic">neu/mati</font><font>, "command" or "bidding," as expressed by nodding the head.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1173_311046"></a>
<sup>29 </sup><font>Origen (<i>De Principiis</i>, I. ii. 10) had argued the "even God cannot be called omnipotent, unless there exist those over whom He may exercise His power," and therefore creation must have been eternal, or God could not have been eternally Omnipotent. In other passages Origen declares it an impiety to hold that matter is co-eternal with God (<i>De Princip</i>. II. i. 4), and yet maintains that there were other worlds before this, and that there was never a time when there was no world existing.</font></p>
<p>Methodius, in a fragment of his work <i>On things Created</i>, preserved by Photius, and quoted by Bishop Bull (<i>Def. fid. Nic.</i> II. xiii. 9), argues against these theories of Origen, that in John i. 2 the words "The same was in the beginning with God" indicate the authority (<font face="SPIonic">tu\ e'cousiastiko/n</font> ) of the Word which He had with the Father before the world came into existence; since from all eternity God the Father, together with His Word, possessed the Almighty power whereby whenever He would He could create worlds to rule over.</p>
<p>Dean Church remarks that "On the other hand Tertullian, <i>contra Hermog</i>. 3, considering the attributes in question to belong not to the Divine Nature, but Office, denies that God was Almighty (Lord?) from eternity; while the Greeks affirmed this (vid. Cyril Alex. <i>in Joann</i>. xvii. 8. p. 963; Athan. <i>Orat</i>. ii. 12-14), as understanding by the term the inherent but latent attribute of doing what He had not yet done, <font face="SPIonic">to\ e 9consiastiko/n</font>."</p>
<p>Cleopas, the Jerusalem Editor, regards the passage as directed against Paul of Samosata, who asserted that Christ had become God, and received His kingdom and Lordship only after His Incarnation, and remarks: - "S. Cyril evidently regards the Lordship of Jesus Christ as twofold: one that which from eternity belonged to Him as God, which he calls natural, according to which `He was ever both Lord and King, as being by nature God0' (Cyril Alex. <i>in Johann</i>. cap. xvii.); and the other the Lordship in time relative to the creatures, by which He exercises dominion over the works created by Him, as being their Maker."</p>

<sup>38 </sup><font>Ex. xxxiii. 13. Cyril means that even before His Incarnation Christ was seen as far as was possible by Prophets such as Moses. This view was held by many of the Fathers before Cyril. See Justin M. (<i>Tryph</i>. ยง 56 ff.); Tertull. (<i>adv. Praxean</i>, ยง 16); Euseb. (<i>Demonstr. Evang</i>. V. 13-16).</font></p>

<sup>47 </sup><font>Ps. cx. 1. Heb. "An oracle of Jehovah unto my lord." Cyril's argument is based upon the common mistake of supposing that </font><font face="SPIonic">Ku/rioj</font><font> represents the same Hebrew word in both parts of the sentence.</font></p>

<sup>48 </sup><font>1 Cor. xv. 27, 28.</font></p>

<p><a name="P1199_319221"></a>
<sup>50 </sup><font>Matt. xi. 27; Luke x. 22. On this text Athanasius wrote a special treatise (<i>In illud Omnia,' &amp;c</i>.), against the arguments of Arius, Eusebisu, and their fellows, who said, - "If all things were delivered (meaning by `all0' the Lordship of Creation), there was once a time when He had them not. But it He had them not, He is not of the Father, for it He were, He would on that account have had them always."</font></p>
<p>Again (<i>contr. Arian. Orat</i>. III. cap. xxvii. ยง 36), Athanasius argues: "Lest a man, perceiving that the Son has all that the Father hath, from the exact likeness and identity of what He hath, should wander into the impiety of Sabellius, considering Him to be the Father, therefore He has said, <i>Was given unto Me</i>, and <i>I received</i>, and <i>Were delivered to Me</i>, only to shew that He is not the Father, but the Father's Word, and the Eternal Son, who, because of His likeness to the Father, has eternally what He has from Him, and because He is the Son, has from the Father what eternally He hath."</p>
