<sup>55 </sup><font>Irenaeus (I. xxiii. 2): "Having purchased from Tyre, a city of Phoenicia, a certain harlot named Helena, he used to carry her about with him, declaring that this woman was the first conception of his mind, the mother of all, by whom in the beginning he conceived in his mind the creation of Angels and Archangels."</font></p>

<sup>57 </sup><font>Irenaeus (I. xxiii. 1): "He taught that it was himself who appeared among the Jews as the Son, and descended in Samaria as the Father, but came to other nations as the Holy Spirit."</font></p>
<p>Cyril here departs from his authority by substituting Mount Sinai for Samaria, and thereby falls into error. Simon had first appeared in Samaria, being a native of Gitton: moreover in claiming to be the Father he meant to set himself far above the inferior Deity who had given the Law on Sinai, saying that he was "the highest of all Powers, that is the Father who is over all."</p>
<p><a name="P806_198045"></a>
<sup>58 </sup><font>"Justin Martyr in his first Apology, addressed to Antoninus Pius, writes thus (c. 26): `There was one Simon a Samaritan, of the village called Gitton, who in the reign of Claudius Caesar, and in your royal city of Rome, did mighty feats of magic by the art of daemons working in him. He was considered a god, and as a god was honoured among you with a statue, which statue was set up in the river Tiber between the two bridges, and bears this inscription in Latin:</font></p>
<ul><p><i>Simoni Deo Sancto</i>;</p>
</ul><p>which is,</p>
<ul><p><i>To Simon the holy God.</i></p>
</ul><p>"The substance of this story is repeated by Irenaeus (<i>adv. Haer</i>. I. xxiii. 1), and by Tertullian (<i>Apol</i>. c. 13), who reproaches the Romans for installing Simon Magus in their Pantheon, and giving him a statue and the title `Holy God.0''</p>
<p>"In A.D. 1574, a stone, which had formed the base of a statue, was dug up on the site described by Justin, the Island in the Tiber, bearing an inscription - `Semoni Sanco Deo Fidio Sacrum, &amp;c. Hence it has been supposed that Justin mistook a statue of the Sabine God, `Semo Sancus,0' for one of Simon Magus. See the notes in Otto's Justin Martyr, and Stieren's Irenaeus.</p>
<p>"On the other hand Tillemont (<i>Memories</i>, t. ii. p. 482) maintains that Justin in an Apology addressed to the emperor and written in Rome itself cannot reasonably be supposed to have fallen into so manifest an error. Whichever view we take of Justin's accuracy concerning the inscription and the statue, there is nothing improbable in his statement that Simon Magus was at Rome in the reign of Claudius."(Extracted by permission from the Speaker's Commentary, <i>Introduction to the Epistle to the Romans</i>, p. 4.)</p>
<p><a name="P808_199806"></a>
<sup>59 </sup><font>"Justin says not one word about St. Peter's alleged visit to Rome, and his encounter with Simon Magus." But "Eusebius in his <i>Ecclesiastical History (c. A.D. 325)</i>, quotes Justin Martyr's story about Simon Magus (<i>E. H.</i> ii. c. 13), and then, without referring to any authority, goes on to assert (c. 14) that `immediately in the same reign of Claudius divine Providence led Peter the great Apostle to Rome to encounter this great destroyer of life,0' and that he thus brought the light of the Gospel from the East to the West0' (<i>ibidem</i>).</font></p>
<p>Eusebius probably borrowed this story "from the strange fictions of the <i>Clementine Recognitions</i> and <i>Homilies</i>, and <i>Apostolic Constitutions</i>." See <i>Recogn</i>. III. 63-65; <i>Hom</i>. I. 15, III. 58; <i>Apsot. Constit</i>. VI. 7, 8, 9 . Cyril's account of Simon's death is taken from the same untrustworthy sources.</p>

<sup>65 </sup><font>Menander is first mentioned by Justin M. (<i>Apolog</i>. I. cap. 26): "Meander, also a Samaritan, of the town Capparetaea, a disciple of Simon, and inspired by devils, we know to have deceived many while he was in Antioch by his magical art. he persuaded those who adhered to him that they should never die." Irenaeus (I. xxiii. 5) adds that Meander announced himself as the Saviour sent by the Invisibles, and taught that the world was created by Angels. See also Tertullian (<i>de Animâ</i>, cap. 50.)</font></p>

<sup>66 </sup><font>Carpocrates, a Platonic philosopher, who taught at Alexandria (125 A.D. <i>circ</i>.), held that the world and all things in it were made by Angels far inferior to the unbegotten (unknown) Father (Iren. I. xxv. 1; Tertullian, <i>Adv. Haer.</i> cap. 3).</font></p>

<sup>72 </sup><font>Marcion accepted only St. Luke's Gospel, and mutilated that (Tertullian, <i>Adv. Marcion</i>. iv. 2). He thus got rid of the testimony of the Apostles and eye-witnesses, Matthew and John, and represented the Law and the Gospel as contradictory revelations of two different Gods. For this Cyril calls him `a second inventor of mischief,0' Simon Magus (§ 14) being the first.</font></p>

<sup>73 </sup><font>Basilides was earlier than Maricon, being the founder of a Gnostic sect at Alexandria in the reign of Hadrian (A.D. 117-138). His doctrines are described by Irenaeus (I. xxvii. 3-7), and very fully by Hippolytus (<i>Refut. omn. Haer</i>. VII. 2-15). The charge of teaching licentiousness attaches rather to the later followers of Basilides than to himself or his son Isidorus (Clem. Alex. <i>Stromat</i>. III. cap. 1) and against which Agrippa Castor wrote a refutation. Origen (<i>Hom</i>. I. <i>in Lucam</i>.) says that Basilides wrote a Gospel bearing his own name. See Routh, <i>Rell. Sacr</i>. I. p. 85; V. p. 106: Westcott, <i>History of Canon of N. T.</i> iv. § 3.</font></p>
<p><a name="P825_205311"></a>
<sup>74 </sup><font>"The doctrines of Valentinus are described fully by Iren§us (I. cap. i.) from whom S. Cyril takes this account. Valentinus, and Basilides, and Bardesanes, and Harmonious, and those of their company admit Christ's conception and birth of the Virgin, but say that God the Word received no addition from the Virgin, but made a sort of passage through her, as though a tube, and made use of a phantom in appearing to men." (Theodoret, <i>Epist</i>. 145.</font></p>

<sup>78 </sup><font>Irenaeus, l. c., and Hippolytus, who gives an elaborate account of the doctrines of Valentinus (L. VI. capp. xvi. - xxxii.), both represent Sophia, "Wisdom," as giving birth not to Satan, but to a shapeless abortion, which was the origin of matter. According to Irenaeus (I. iv. 2), Achamoth, the enthymesis of Sophia, gave birth to the Demiurge, and "from her tears all that is of a liquid nature was formed."</font></p>
<p>In Tertullian's Treatise <i>against the Valentinians</i> chap. xxii., Achamoth is said as by Cyril to have given birth to Satan: but in chap. xxiii. Satan seems to be identified (or interchanged) with the Demiurge.</p>
<p><a name="P832_208800"></a>
<sup>79 </sup><font>The account in Irenaeus (I. ii. 6) is rather different: "The whole Pleroma of the Aeons, with one design and desire, and with the concurrence of the Christ and the Holy Spirit, their Father also setting the seal of His approval on their conduct, brought together whatever each one had in himself of the greatest beauty and preciousness; and uniting all these contributions so as skilfully to blend the whole, they produced, to the honour and glory of Bythus, a being of most perfect beauty, the very star of the Pleroma, and its perfect fruit, namely Jesus."</font></p>
<p>Tertullian, <i>Against the Valentinians</i>, chap. 12, gives a sarcastic description of this strange doctrine, deriving his facts (chap. 5) from Justin, Miltiades, "Irenaeus, that very exact inquirer into all doctrines," and Proculus.</p>
<p><a name="P833_209643"></a>
<sup>80 </sup><font>This statement does not agree with Irenaeus (I. vii. 1), who says that the Valentinians represented the Saviour, that is Jesus, as becoming the bridegroom of Achamoth or Sophia.</font></p>

<sup>85 </sup><font>Routh (R. S. V. p. 12) comes to the conclusion that the famous disputation between Manes and Archelaus took place between July and December, A.D. 277. Accordingly these Lectures, being "full 70 years" later, could not have been delivered before the Spring of A.D. 348.</font></p>

<sup>86 </sup><font>Leo the Great (<i>Serm</i>. xv. cap. 4) speaks of the madness of the later Manichees as including all errors and impieties: "all profanity of Paganism, all blindness of the carnal Jews, the illicit secrets of the magic art, the sacrilege and blasphemy of all heresies, flowed together in that sect as into a sort of cess-pool of all filth." Leo summoned those whom they called the "elect." both men and women, before an assembly of Bishops and Presbyters, and obtained from these witnesses a full account of the execrable practices of the sect, in which, as he declares, "their law is lying, their religion the devil, their sacrifice obscenity."</font></p>
