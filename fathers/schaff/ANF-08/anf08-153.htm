<ul><p>Habib the martyr, clad in flame, hath called to me out of the fire,</p>
<ul><p>That for him likewise I should fashion an image of beauty among the glorious.</p>
</ul><p>Comrade of conquerors, lo! he beckoneth to me out of the burning,</p>
<ul><p>That, as for the glory of his Lord, I should sing concerning him.</p>
</ul><p>In the midst of live coals stands the <i>heroic</i> man, and lo! he calleth to me,</p>
<ul><p>That I should fashion his image: but the blazing fire permits me not.</p>
</ul><p>His love is fervid, glowing is his faith;</p>
<ul><p>His fire also burneth, and who is adequate to recount his love?</p>
</ul><p>Nay, by reason of that love which led the martyr into the fire,</p>
<ul><p>No man is able to recount his beauties divine.</p>
</ul><p>For who shall dare enter and see in the blazing fire</p>
</ul><p>To whom he is like, and after what pattern he is to be fashioned among the glorious?</p>
<ul><p>Shall I fashion his image by the side of the youths, the children of the furnace?</p>
<ul><p>With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib? I know not.</p>
</ul><p>Lo! these were not burned there: how, then, is he like?</p>
<ul><p>He, <i>I say</i>, like them, when he was burned and the youths not?</p>
</ul><p>Which, I ask, <i>the more</i> beautiful-Habib the martyr, or Azariah?</p>
<ul><p>Difficult for me is the image: how I am to look upon it, I know not.</p>
</ul><p>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;</p>
<ul><p>But Habib was burned: which, then, <i>the more</i> beautiful to him that looketh upon him?</p>
</ul><p>Who shall dare say that this is repulsive, or that;</p>
</ul><p>Or not so comely this as that, to him that beholdeth him?</p>
<ul><p>Three <i>there are</i> in the fire, and the flame cometh not near them;</p>
<ul><p>But one was burned: and how shall I suffice to tell</p>
</ul><p>That the Fourth <i>form</i> is that of Him who went down into the midst of the furnace,</p>
<ul><p>That He might fashion an image for Habib there along with <i>those of</i> the three?</p>
</ul><p>He giveth a place in the fire to him who was burned,</p>
</ul><p>That he may be, instead of Him the Fourth, by the side of the conquerors.</p>
<ul><p>And, if of the three the beauties be glorious, though they were not burned,</p>
<ul><p>How shall not this one, who <i>was</i> burned, be mingled with the glorious?</p>
</ul><p>If a man have the power either to be burned or not to be burned,</p>
<ul><p>Of this man, who was burned, more exalted was the beauty than that of the three.</p>
</ul><p>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control <i>of all things</i>,</p>
</ul><p><i>He</i> is to be praised, <i>both</i> where He rescues and where He delivers up.</p>
<ul><p>Moreover, too, the will of the three who were not burned,</p>
<ul><p>And of him who was burned, is one and the same, in this case and in that;<sup><a href="footnote/fn106.htm#P10667_3347609" id="P10667_3347609" name="P10667_3347609">2</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to burn them,</p>
<ul><p><i>Even</i> those three on their part, burned they would have been; </p>
</ul><p>And, if He had signified to it that it should not burn that one man also,</p>
<ul><p>He would not have been burned; nor had it been of himself that he was rescued.</p>
</ul><p>To go into the fire was of their own will, when they went in;</p>
<ul><p>But that they were not burned-<i>because</i> the Lord of the fire willed and commanded it.</p>
</ul><p>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him who was burned,</p>
</ul><p>And that of him who was not burned, because the will also was equal.</p>
<ul><p>Beloved martyr! exalted is thy beauty; exalted is thy rank:</p>
<ul><p>Graceful too thy crown, and mingled thy story with <i>that of</i> the glorious.</p>
</ul><p>Choice gold art thou, and the fire hath tried thee, and resplendent is thy beauty.</p>
<ul><p>And lo! into the King's crown art thou wrought, along with the victorious.</p>
</ul><p>Good workman! who, in the doctrine of the Son of God,</p>
</ul><p>Pursueth his course like a valiant<sup><a href="footnote/fn106.htm#P10683_3348546" id="P10683_3348546" name="P10683_3348546">3</a></sup> man, because of the beauty of his faith.</p>
<ul><p>Habib the martyr was a teacher of that which is true;</p>
<ul><p>A preacher also, whose mouth was full of faith.</p>
</ul><p>Watchful was he, and prompt <i>for service;</i> and he encouraged with his teaching</p>
<ul><p>The household of the house of God, through his faith.</p>
</ul><p>Of light was he full, and he wrestled with the darkness</p>
<ul><p>Which overspread the country from the paganism which had darkened it.</p>
</ul><p>With the Gospel of the Son was his mouth filled in the congregations;</p>
</ul><p>And as it were a leader of the way did he become to the villages when he arrived in them.</p>
<ul><p>Zealous he was, because he was concerned for the doctrine</p>
<ul><p>Divine, that he might establish the adherents<sup><a href="footnote/fn106.htm#P10696_3349418" id="P10696_3349418" name="P10696_3349418">4</a></sup> of the faith.</p>
</ul><p>At the time when the winds of the pagans blew, a lamp was he,</p>
<ul><p>And flamed forth whilst they blew upon him, and went not out.</p>
</ul><p>All on fire was he, and filled with the love of his Lord, and was concerned</p>
</ul><p>For this-that he might speak of Him without hindrance.<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10701_3349718" id="P10701_3349718" name="P10701_3349718">5</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>The thorns of errour sprang up in the land from paganism;</p>
<ul><p>And, as much as in him lay, he rooted them out by his diligence.</p>
</ul><p>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in the faith,</p>
<ul><p>The friends of Christ,<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10707_3350048" id="P10707_3350048" name="P10707_3350048">6</a></sup> who were harassed by persecutors.</p>
</ul><p>Against sword and against fire did he wrestle,</p>
<ul><p>With love hot as the flame, and was not afraid.</p>
</ul><p>Like a two-edged brand,<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10711_3350364" id="P10711_3350364" name="P10711_3350364">7</a></sup> keen was</p>
<ul><p>His faith, and against error did he contend.</p>
</ul><p>Leaven did he prove to be in this land which had become exhausted<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10714_3350843" id="P10714_3350843" name="P10714_3350843">8</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>Through fondness for the idols of vanity which error had brought in.</p>
</ul><p>He was like salt by reason of his savoury doctrine</p>
</ul><p>To this region, which had become insipid through unbelief.</p>
<ul><p>A deacon was he, and filled the place of a high-priest</p>
<ul><p>By the preaching and teaching of that which is true.</p>
</ul><p>He was to the flock a good shepherd whilst he was <i>its</i> overseer;</p>
<ul><p>And his life laid he down for the flock while he tended it.</p>
</ul><p>He chased away the wolf, and drove off from it the beast of prey.</p>
<ul><p>And he repaired the breaches, and gathered the lambs into their folds.</p>
</ul><p>He went out secretly <i>and</i> encouraged the congregations:</p>
<ul><p>He strengthened them, and exhorted them, and held them up.</p>
</ul><p>And he forged armour of faith, and put it on them,</p>
</ul><p>That they might not be ignominiously overthrown<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10729_3352155" id="P10729_3352155" name="P10729_3352155">9</a></sup> by the paganism which abounded.</p>
<ul><p>The flocks of the fold of the Son of God were being laid waste</p>
<ul><p>By persecutors: and he encouraged the lambs and the ewes. </p>
</ul><p>And he was an advocate to the household of faith;</p>
<ul><p>And he taught them not to be daunted by persecutors.</p>
</ul><p>He taught them to run to meet death,</p>
<ul><p>Without being afraid either of sword or of fire.</p>
</ul><p>In the teaching of the Son of God he prospered,</p>
</ul><p>So that his faith pursued its course without dread.</p>
<ul><p>Then errour grew envious, became furious, and was maddened, because of him;</p>
<ul><p>And she pursued after him, that she might shed upon the earth innocent blood.</p>
</ul><p>The Defamer, who hates the race of men,</p>
<ul><p>Laid snares for him, that he might rid the place of his presence.<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10744_3352881" id="P10744_3352881" name="P10744_3352881">10</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>He who hateth the truth pursued after him to put him to death,</p>
<ul><p>That he might make his voice to cease<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10747_3353006" id="P10747_3353006" name="P10747_3353006">11</a></sup> from the teaching of the house of God.</p>
</ul><p>And errour raised an outcry <i>demanding</i> that Habib should die, because she hated him;</p>
</ul><p>Vexation goaded her on, and she sought to take away his life.</p>
<ul><p>His story was talked about<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10752_3353257" id="P10752_3353257" name="P10752_3353257">12</a></sup> before the pagan judge of the country,</p>
<ul><p>And the dear fame of him reached the king: who in great rage,</p>
</ul><p>And because the diadem was interwoven with paganism, decreed<sup><a href="footnote/fn107.htm#P10755_3353441" id="P10755_3353441" name="P10755_3353441">13</a></sup> death</p>
<ul><p>Against Habib, because he was full of faith.</p>
</ul><p>And, when the command reached the judge, he armed himself</p>
<ul><p>With rage and fury; and, with a mind thirsting for blood,</p>
</ul><p>And like hunters who lay nets for the young stag,</p>
</ul><p>After Habib did they go out to catch <i>him</i>.</p>
<ul><p>But this man was a preacher of the faith,</p>
<ul><p>Who in the highway of the crucifixion was prospering;</p>
</ul><p>And, that he might benefit by his teaching the children of his people,</p>
<ul><p>His work embraced the countries round about him.</p>
</ul><p>So, when error went out after him, she found him not:</p>
<ul><p>Not that he was fled, but that he had gone out to preach the Gospel.</p>
</ul><p>Then, because of the fury of the pagans, which was great beyond all that was meet,</p>
</ul><p>His kindred and his mother did they seize for his sake.</p>
<ul><p>Blessed art thou, O woman! mother since thou art of the martyr.</p>
<ul><p>For wherefore was it that they seized thee <i>and</i> bound thee, iniquitously?</p>
</ul><p>What do they require of thee, O thou full of beauty? What, <i>I ask</i>, have they required of thee?</p>
<ul><p>Lo! they require of thee that thou bring the martyr, that he may be a sacrifice.</p>
</ul><p>Bring, oh bring thy sweet fruit to the place of the oblation-</p>
<ul><p><i>The fruit</i> whose smell is fragrant, that it may be incense to the Godhead.</p>
</ul><p>Fair shoot, thy cluster bring from where it is,</p>
</ul><p>That its wine may be for a libation whose taste is sweet.</p>
<ul><p>The lamb heard that they were seeking him, that he might be a sacrifice;</p>
<ul><p>And he set out and came to the sacrificers rejoicing.</p>
</ul><p>He heard that others also were being afflicted for his sake,</p>
<ul><p>And he came that he might bear the suffering which was his, in the stead of many.</p>
</ul><p>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone a sacrifice;</p>
<ul><p>And the fire that was to offer him up was looking out <i>for him</i> until he came.</p>
</ul><p>Of the many who were bound for his sake</p>
<ul><p>Not one single person was seized to die, but only he.</p>
</ul><p>He it was that was worthy, and for him was martyrdom reserved;</p>
<ul><p>And to snatch the martyr's place no man was able.</p>
</ul><p>And therefore of his own will did he present himself</p>
<ul><p>To the judge, that he might be seized, and die for Jesus' sake.</p>
</ul><p>He heard that they sought him, and he came that he might be seized, even as they sought him:</p>
<ul><p>And he went in of himself before the judge, and dauntless was his look.</p>
</ul><p>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to flee from the judge:</p>
</ul><p>For with light was he imbued, and from the darkness he would not flee.</p>
<ul><p>No robber <i>was he</i>, no murderer, no thief,</p>
<ul><p>No child of night: but all his course was run in open day.</p>
</ul><p>Wherefore from his flock should the good shepherd flee,</p>
<ul><p>And leave his fold to be devoured by robbers?</p>
</ul><p>Wherefore should the physician flee, who goeth forth to heal diseases,</p>
<ul><p>And to cure souls by the blood of the Son of God? </p>
</ul><p>A fearless countenance<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10804_3356222" id="P10804_3356222" name="P10804_3356222">14</a></sup> did the <i>brave</i> man carry with him, and a great heart;</p>
</ul><p>And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for Jesus' sake.</p>
<ul><p>He went in, he stood before the judge, saying to him:</p>
<ul><p>I am Habib, whom ye sought: lo! <i>here</i> I stand.</p>
</ul><p>And the pagan trembled, and amazement seized him, and he marvelled at him-</p>
<ul><p>At the man who was not afraid, either of sword or of fire.</p>
</ul><p>While he thought that he was fleeing apace, he entered in and mocked him;</p>
</ul><p>And the judge shook, for he saw him courageous in the <i>very</i> face of death.</p>
<ul><p>A disciple he of that Son of God who said:</p>
<ul><p>"Rise, come, let us go: for he that betrayeth me lo! is here."</p>
</ul><p>And to the crucifiers, again, He said: "Whom seek ye? "</p>
<ul><p>They say: "Jesus." And He said to them: "I am He."</p>
</ul><p>The Son of God of His own will came to the cross;</p>
</ul><p>And on Him the martyr looked, and presented himself <i>uncompelled</i> before the judge.</p>
<ul><p>And the pagan beheld him, and was smitten with fear, and was exasperated <i>against him</i>.</p>
<ul><p>His rage was excited, and he began in his fury to put to him questions.<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10823_3357240" id="P10823_3357240" name="P10823_3357240">15</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>And, as if he had been one who had shed on the ground the blood of the slain,</p>
<ul><p>He proceeded to question the saintly man, but he was not ashamed</p>
</ul><p>Menacing him, and trying to terrify him, and to frighten him,</p>
</ul><p>And recounting the sufferings which were being prepared by him on his account.</p>
<ul><p>But Habib, when questioned, was not afraid,</p>
<ul><p>Was not ashamed, and was not frightened by the menaces <i>he heard</i>.</p>
</ul><p>Lifting up his voice, he confessed Jesus, the Son of God-</p>
<ul><p>That he was His servant, and was His priest, and His minister.<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10833_3357783" id="P10833_3357783" name="P10833_3357783">16</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>At the fury of the pagans, roaring at him like lions,</p>

</ul><p>He was scourged, and the scourgings were very dear to him,</p>
<ul><p>Seeing that he bore a little of the stripes of the Son of God.</p>
</ul><p>He was put into bonds,<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10840_3358097" id="P10840_3358097" name="P10840_3358097">18</a></sup> and he looked on his Lord, whom also they had bound;</p>
<ul><p>And his heart rejoiced that in the path of His sufferings he had begun to walk.</p>
</ul><p>He ascended the block,<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10843_3358292" id="P10843_3358292" name="P10843_3358292">19</a></sup> and they tore him with combs, but his soul was radiant with light,</p>
</ul><p>Because he was <i>deemed</i> worthy that on him should come the agony of the sufferings of crucifixion.</p>
<ul><p>In the pathway of death had he set his face to walk,</p>
<ul><p>And what could he desire to find in it but sufferings?</p>
</ul><p>The fire of sacrifice<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10849_3358614" id="P10849_3358614" name="P10849_3358614">20</a></sup> was betrothed to him, and for her did he look;</p>
<ul><p>And she <i>on her part</i> sent him combs, and stripes, and pains, to taste.</p>
</ul><p>All the while that she was coming, she sent him sufferings, that by means of them</p>
<ul><p>He might be prepared, so that when she met him she might not dismay him.</p>
</ul><p>Sufferings purged him, so that, when the blazing fire should put him to the proof,</p>
<ul><p>There might not be any dross <i>found</i> in his choice gold.</p>
</ul><p>And he endured the whole of the pains that came upon him,</p>
</ul><p>That he might have experience <i>of suffering</i>, and in the burning stand like a brave man.</p>
<ul><p>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings which he had to bear:</p>
<ul><p>For he knew that at their termination he should find death.</p>
</ul><p>And he was not afraid, either of death or of sufferings:</p>
<ul><p>For with that wine of the crucifixion his heart was drunk.</p>
</ul><p>He despised his body, while it was being dragged along by the persecutors;</p>
<ul><p>And his limbs, while they were being torn asunder in bitter agony.<sup><a href="footnote/fn108.htm#P10864_3359570" id="P10864_3359570" name="P10864_3359570">21</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>Scourges on his back, combs on his sides, stocks on his feet,</p>
</ul><p>And fire in front of him: still was he brave and full of faith.</p>
<ul><p>They taunted him: Lo! thou worshippest a man;</p>
<ul><p>But he said: A man I worship not,</p>
</ul><p>But God, who took a body and became man: </p>
<ul><p>Him do I worship, because He is God with Him that begat Him.</p>
</ul><p>The faith of Habib, the martyr, was full of light</p>
<ul><p>And by it was enlightened Edessa, the faithful <i>city</i>.</p>
</ul><p>The daughter of Abgar, whom Addaeus betrothed to the crucifixion-</p>
<ul><p>Through it is her light, through it her truth and her faith.</p>
</ul><p>Her king is from it, her martyrs from it, her truth from it;</p>
<ul><p>The teachers also of <i>her</i> faith are from it.</p>
</ul><p>Abgar believed that Thou an God, the Son of God;</p>
<ul><p>And he received a blessing because of the beauty of his faith.</p>
</ul><p>Sharbil the martyr, son of the Edessaeans, more-ever said:</p>
<ul><p>My heart is led captive by God, who became man.</p>
</ul><p>And Habib the martyr, who also was crowned at Edessa,</p>
<ul><p>Confessed these things: that He took a body and became man;</p>
</ul><p>That He is the Son of God, and also is God, and became man.</p>
<ul><p>Edessa learned from teachers the things that are true:</p>
</ul><p>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her, the faith;</p>
<ul><p>But to others, who were fraudulent teachers, she would not hearken.</p>
</ul><p>Habib the martyr, in the ear of Edessa, thus cried aloud</p>
<ul><p>Out of the midst of the fire: A man I worship not,</p>
</ul><p>But God, who took a body and became man</p>
<ul><p>Him do I worship. <i>Thus</i> confessed the martyr with uplifted voice.</p>
</ul><p>From confessors torn with combs, burnt, raised up <i>on the block</i>, slain</p>
<ul><p>And <i>from</i> a righteous king, did Edessa learn the faith,</p>
</ul><p>And she knows our Lord-that He is even God, the Son of God;</p>
<ul><p>She also learned and firmly believed that He took a body and became man.</p>
</ul><p>Not from common scribes did she learn the faith:</p>
<ul><p>Her king taught her, her martyrs taught her; and she firmly believed them:</p>
</ul><p>And, if she be calumniated as having ever worshipped a man,</p>
<ul><p>She points to her martyrs, who died for Him as being God.</p>
</ul><p>A man I worship not, said Habib,</p>
<ul><p>Because it is written: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in a man."<sup><a href="footnote/fn109.htm#P10902_3361595" id="P10902_3361595" name="P10902_3361595">22</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>Forasmuch as He is God, I worship Him, yea submit to be burned</p>
<ul><p>For His sake, nor will I renounce His faith.</p>
</ul><p>This truth has Edessa held fast from her youth,</p>
<ul><p>And in her old age she will not barter it away as a daughter of the poor.</p>
</ul><p>Her righteous king became to her a scribe, and from him she learned</p>
<ul><p>Concerning our Lord-that He is the Son of God, yea God.</p>
</ul><p>Addaeus, who brought the bridegroom's ring and put it on her hand,</p>
<ul><p>Betrothed her thus to the Son of God, who is the Only-<i>begotten</i>.</p>
</ul><p>Sharbil the priest, who made trial and proof of all gods,</p>
<ul><p>Died, even as he said, "for God who became man."</p>
</ul><p>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the Only-<i>begotten</i>,</p>
<ul><p>Stretched out their necks <i>to receive the stroke</i>, and for Him died, forasmuch as He is God.</p>
</ul><p>And Habib the martyr, who was teacher of congregations,</p>
<ul><p>Preached of Him, that He took a body and became man.</p>
</ul><p>For a man the martyr would not have <i>submitted to be</i> burned in the fire;</p>
<ul><p>But he was burned "for the sake of God who became man."</p>
</ul><p>And Edessa is witness that thus he confessed while he was being burned:</p>
<ul><p>And from the confession of a martyr that has been burned who is he that can escape?</p>
</ul><p>All minds does faith reduce to silence and despise-</p>
<ul><p><i>She</i> that is full of light and stoopeth not to shadows.</p>
</ul><p>She despiseth him that maligns the Son by denying that He is God;</p>
<ul><p>Him too that saith "He took not a body and became man."</p>
</ul><p>In faith which was full of truth he stood upon the fire;</p>
<ul><p>And he became incense, and propitiated with his fragrance the Son of God.</p>
</ul><p>In all <i>his</i> afflictions, and in all <i>his</i> tortures, and in all <i>his</i> sufferings,</p>
<ul><p>Thus did he confess, and thus did he teach the blessed <i>city</i>.</p>
</ul><p>And this truth did Edessa hold fast touching our Lord-</p>
<ul><p>Even that He is God, and of Mary became a man.</p>
</ul><p>And the bride hates him that denies His God-head,</p>
<ul><p>And despises and contemns him that maligns His corporeal nature.</p>
</ul><p>And she recognises Him <i>as</i> One in Godhead and in manhood- </p>
<ul><p>The Only-<i>begotten</i>, whose body is inseparable from Him.</p>
</ul><p>And thus did the daughter of the Parthians learn to believe,</p>
</ul><p>And thus did she firmly hold, and thus does she teach him that listens to her.</p>
<ul><p>The judge, therefore, full of <i>zeal for</i> paganism, commanded</p>
<ul><p>That the martyr should be led forth and burned in the fire which was reserved for him.</p>
</ul><p>And forthwith a strap was thrust into his mouth, as <i>though he had been</i> a murderer,</p>
<ul><p>His confession being kept within his heart towards God.</p>
</ul><p>And they hurried him away, and he went out from the judgment-hall, rejoicing</p>
<ul><p>That the hour was come when the crown should be given to his faith.</p>
</ul><p>And there went out with him crowds of people, that they might bear him company,</p>
<ul><p>Looking upon him, not as a dead man accompanied <i>to his burial</i>,</p>
</ul><p>But as a man who was going away that by means of fire he might become a bridegroom,</p>
<ul><p>And that there might be bestowed the crown which was by righteousness reserved for him.</p>
</ul><p>They looked upon him as upon a man entering into battle,</p>
<ul><p>And around him were spears, and lances, and swords, but he vanquished them.</p>
</ul><p>They beheld him going up like a champion from the contest,</p>
<ul><p>And in his triumph chaplets were brought to him by those who beheld.</p>
</ul><p>They looked upon him as he vanquished principalities and powers,</p>
<ul><p>Which all made war with him, and he put them to shame.</p>
</ul><p>The whole congregation of the followers of Christ exulted over him,</p>
<ul><p>Because he raised up the friends<sup><a href="footnote/fn109.htm#P10956_3364892" id="P10956_3364892" name="P10956_3364892">23</a></sup> of the faith by the sufferings which he bore.</p>
</ul><p>There went forth with him the Church, a bride full of light;</p>
</ul><p>And her face was beaming on the beloved martyr who was united to her.</p>
<ul><p>Then did his mother, because it was the marriage-feast for her son,</p>
<ul><p>Deck herself in garments nobler than her wont.</p>
</ul><p>Since sordid raiment suited not the banquet-hall,</p>
<ul><p>In magnificent <i>attire</i> all white she clad herself fight tastefully.</p>
</ul><p>Hither to the battle came down love to fight</p>
<ul><p>In the mother's soul-<i>the love</i> of nature, and <i>the love</i> of God.</p>
</ul><p>She looked upon her son as he went forth to be put into the flame;</p>
<ul><p>And, forasmuch as there was in her the love of the Lord, she suffered not.</p>
</ul><p>The yearnings of her mother's womb cried out on behalf of its fruit;</p>
<ul><p>But faith silenced them, so that their tumult ceased.</p>
</ul><p>Nature shrieked over the limb which was severed from her;</p>
<ul><p>But the love of the Lord intoxicated the soul, that she should not perceive it.</p>
</ul><p>Nature loved, but the love of the Lord did conquer in the strife</p>
<ul><p>Within the soul of the mother, that she should not grieve for her beloved.</p>
</ul><p>And instead of suffering, her heart was filled with all emotions of joy;</p>
<ul><p>And, instead of mourning, she went forth in splendid apparel.</p>
</ul><p>And she accompanied him as he went out to be burned, and was elate,</p>
<ul><p>Because the love of the Lord vanquished that of nature.</p>
</ul><p>And <i>clad</i> in white, as for a bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast-</p>
<ul><p><i>She</i> the mother of the martyr, and was blithe because of him.</p>
</ul><p>"Shamuna the Second" may we call this blessed <i>one: </i></p>
<ul><p>Since, had seven been burned instead of one, she had been well content.</p>
</ul><p>One she had, and she gave him to be food for the fire;</p>
<ul><p>And, even as that one, if she had had seven, she had given <i>them all</i>.</p>
</ul><p>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze kindled around him;</p>
<ul><p>And his mother looked on, and grieved not at his burning.</p>
</ul><p>Another eye, which gazeth upon the things unseen,</p>
<ul><p>Was in her soul, and by reason of this she exulted when he was being burned.</p>
</ul><p>On the gems of light which are in martyrs' crowns she looked,</p>
<ul><p>And on the glory which is laid up for them after their sufferings;</p>
</ul><p>And <i>on</i> the promised blessings which they inherit yonder through their afflictions,</p>
<ul><p>And <i>on</i> the Son of God who clothes their limbs with light;</p>
</ul><p>And <i>on</i> the manifold beauties of that kingdom which shall not be dissolved,</p>
<ul><p>And <i>on</i> the ample door which is opened for them to enter in to God.</p>
</ul><p>On these did the martyr's mother look when he was being burned,</p>
<ul><p>And she rejoiced, she exalted, and in white did she go forth with him. </p>
</ul><p>She looked upon him while the fire consumed his frame,</p>
</ul><p>And, forasmuch as his crown was very noble, she grieved not.</p>
<ul><p>The sweet root was thrown into the fire, upon the coals;</p>
<ul><p>And it turned to incense, and cleansed the air from pollution.</p>
</ul><p>With the fumes of sacrifice had the air been polluted,</p>
<ul><p>And by the burning of this martyr was it cleansed.</p>
</ul><p>The firmament was fetid with the exhalations from<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11004_3367762" id="P11004_3367762" name="P11004_3367762">24</a></sup> the altars;</p>
<ul><p>And there rose up the sweet perfume of the martyr, and it grew sweet thereby.</p>
</ul><p>And the sacrifices ceased, and there was peace in the assemblies;</p>
</ul><p>And the sword was blunted, that it should no more lay waste the friends of Christ.</p>
<ul><p>With Sharbil it began, with Habib it ended, in our land;</p>
<ul><p>And from that time<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11011_3368107" id="P11011_3368107" name="P11011_3368107">25</a></sup> even until now not one has it shin, since he was burned.</p>
</ul><p>Constantine, chief of conquerors, took the empire,</p>
<ul><p>And the cross has trampled on the diadem of the emperor, and is set upon his head.</p>
</ul><p>Broken is the lofty horn of idolatry,</p>
<ul><p>And from the burning of the martyr even until now not one has it pierced.</p>
</ul><p>His smoke arose, and it became incense to the Godhead;</p>
<ul><p>And by it was the air purged which was tainted by paganism,</p>
</ul><p>And by his burning was the whole land cleansed:</p>
</ul><p>Blessed be he that gave him a crown, and glory, and a good name!</p>
<p><i>Here</i> endeth the Homily on Habib the martyr, composed by Mar Jacob.</p>
