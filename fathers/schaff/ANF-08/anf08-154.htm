<ul><p>Shamuna and Guria, martyrs who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,</p>
<ul><p>Have in love required of me to tell of their illustrious deeds.</p>
</ul><p>To champions of the faith the doctrine calleth me,</p>
<ul><p>That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p>
</ul><p>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,</p>
<ul><p>Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:-</p>
</ul><p>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</p>
<ul><p>And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</p>
</ul><p>Those who were the salt of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,</p>
<ul><p>And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:</p>
</ul><p>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,</p>
<ul><p>By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:</p>
</ul><p>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</p>
</ul><p>Of every <i>kind of</i> error, the lights were not put out;</p>
<ul><p>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</p>
<ul><p>In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</p>
</ul><p>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</p>
<ul><p>Against all spoilers in all the wars that surrounded us:</p>
</ul><p>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,</p>
<ul><p>And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:</p>
</ul><p>Two precious pearls, which were</p>
</ul><p>An ornament for the bride of my lord Abgar, the Aramaean's son.</p>
<ul><p>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</p>
<ul><p>And whose faith was known by their sufferings.</p>
</ul><p>On their bodies they wrote the story of the Son of God</p>
<ul><p>With <i>the marks of</i> combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p>
</ul><p>They showed their love, not by words of the mouth alone,</p>
<ul><p>But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p>
</ul><p>For the love of the Son of God they gave up their bodies: </p>
<ul><p>Since it beseemeth the lover that for his love he should give up himself.</p>
</ul><p>Fire and sword proved their love, how true <i>it was; </i></p>
</ul><p>And more beautiful than silver tried in <i>a furnace of</i> earth were their necks.</p>
<ul><p>They looked on God, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</p>
<ul><p>Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</p>
</ul></ul><p>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</p>
<p>And they were enlightened by it, and with His light chased they away the darkness.</p>
<ul><p>At the idols of vanity, which error had brought in, they laughed,</p>
<ul><p>Instinct with the faith of the Son of God which is full of light.</p>
</ul><p>The love of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</p>
<ul><p>Nor could all the brambles of idolatry stand before it.</p>
</ul><p>Fixed was their love on God unchangeably:<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11073_3371275" id="P11073_3371275" name="P11073_3371275">1</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword,<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11075_3371359" id="P11075_3371359" name="P11075_3371359">2</a></sup> all athirst as it was for blood.</p>
<ul><p>With guilelesshess and <i>yet with</i> wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,</p>
<ul><p>As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is true.</p>
</ul><p>Despising as they did kindred and family, guileless were they;</p>
<ul><p>Forasmuch, also, as possessions and wealth were held in no account by them.</p>
</ul><p><i>Nor guileless only:</i> for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents <i>too</i></p>
</ul><p>They were heedful of the faith of the house of God.</p>
<ul><p>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</p>
<ul><p>But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</p>
</ul><p>And, so long as his head is kept <i>from harm</i>, his life abideth in him;</p>
<ul><p>But, if the head be struck, his life is left a <i>prey</i> to destruction.</p>
</ul><p>The head of the soul is men's faith;</p>
<ul><p>And, if this be preserved <i>unharmed</i>, by it is also preserved their life:<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11090_3372166" id="P11090_3372166" name="P11090_3372166">3</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</p>
<ul><p><i>Yet</i>, so long as faith is preserved, the soul is alive;</p>
</ul><p>But, if faith is struck <i>down</i> by unbelief,</p>
</ul><p>Lost is the soul, and life has perished from the man.</p>
<ul><p>Shamuna and Guria of the faith as men<sup><a href="footnote/fn110.htm#P11097_3372486" id="P11097_3372486" name="P11097_3372486">4</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>Were heedful, that it should not be struck <i>down</i> by persecutors:</p>
</ul><p>For they knew that, if faith is preserved,</p>
<ul><p>Both soul and body are preserved from destruction.</p>
</ul><p>And, because of this, touching their faith were they solicitous,</p>
</ul><p>That that should not be struck <i>down</i> in which their very life was hidden.</p>
<ul><p>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11105_3372861" id="P11105_3372861" name="P11105_3372861">5</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>Yea to every <i>kind of</i> torture, that their faith should not be stricken <i>down; </i></p>
</ul><p>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</p>
<ul><p>So hid they their faith within their hearts;</p>
</ul><p>And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:</p>
</ul><p>But overthrown was not their faith which was within their hearts.</p>
<ul><p>The mouth betrayeth the soul to death when it speaks,</p>
<ul><p>And with the tongue, as with a sword, worketh slaughter.</p>
</ul><p>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</p>
<ul><p>Denying <i>a man</i> dies, confessing he lives, and <i>the mouth</i> hath power over it.</p>
</ul><p>Denial is death, and in confession is the soul's life;</p>
<ul><p>And power hath the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p>
</ul><p>The word of the mouth openeth the door for death to enter in;</p>
<ul><p>This, too, calleth for life, and it beameth forth upon the man.</p>
</ul><p>Even the robber by one word of faith</p>
<ul><p>Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise,<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11122_3373748" id="P11122_3373748" name="P11122_3373748">6</a></sup> all fraught with blessings.</p>
</ul><p>The wicked judges too, from the martyrs, the sons of the right hand,</p>
<ul><p>Demanded that by word of mouth only they should blaspheme;</p>
</ul><p>But, like true men holding fast the faith,</p>
</ul><p>They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p>
<ul><p>Shamuna, beauty of our faith, who is adequate to <i>tell of</i> thee?</p>
<ul><p>All too narrow is my mouth for thy praise, too mean for thee to be spoken of by it.</p>
</ul><p>Thy truth is thy beauty, thy crown thy suffering, thy wealth thy stripes,</p>
<ul><p>And by reason of thy blows magnificent is the beauty of thy championship. </p>
</ul></ul><p>Proud of thee is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</p>
<p>Since wealth art thou to us, and a coveted store which cannot be stolen <i>from us</i>.</p>
<ul><p>Guria, martyr, staunch hero of our faith,</p>
<ul><p>Who shall suffice thee, to recount thy beauties divine?</p>
</ul><p>Lo! tortures on thy body are set like gems of beryl,</p>
<ul><p>And the sword on thy neck like a chain of choice gold.</p>
</ul><p>Thy blood upon thy form is a robe of glory full of beauty,</p>
<ul><p>And the scourging of thy back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</p>
</ul><p>Radiant thou art and comely by virtue of these thy sufferings, so abounding;</p>
</ul><p>And resplendent are thy beauties, because of the pains which are <i>so</i> severe upon thee.</p>
<ul><p>Shamuna, our riches, richer art thou than the rich:</p>
<ul><p>For Io! the rich stand at thy door, that thou mayest relieve them.</p>
</ul><p>Small thy village, poor thy country: who, then, gave thee</p>
<ul><p>That lords of villages and cities should court thy favour?</p>
</ul><p>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p>
<ul><p>Take dust from thy threshold, as <i>though it were</i> the medicine of life.</p>
</ul><p>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increaseth riches;</p>
</ul><p>And its poverty despiseth all the riches of the world.</p>
<ul><p>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the poor, lo! at your doors</p>
<ul><p>Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you <i>supplies for</i> their wants.</p>
</ul><p>The Son of God in poverty and want</p>
<ul><p>Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</p>
</ul><p><i>His disciples</i>, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</p>
<ul><p>All men of little note, became illustrious through His faith.</p>
</ul><p>One fisherman, whose "village" too was a home of fishermen,<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11160_3375807" id="P11160_3375807" name="P11160_3375807">7</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house.<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11162_3375887" id="P11162_3375887" name="P11162_3375887">8</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</p>
</ul><p>He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the faith.</p>
<ul><p>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not wealthy,</p>
<ul><p>And lo! in a great city became they lords;</p>
</ul><p>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</p>
<ul><p>And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p>
</ul><p>From their confession of the faith of the Son of God</p>
<ul><p>These blessed men acquired. riches beyond compute.</p>
</ul><p>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</p>
</ul><p>And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p>
<ul><p>The chosen martyrs did battle against error,</p>
<ul><p>And in the confession of the Son of God stood they firm like valiant men.</p>
</ul><p>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted,<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11178_3376632" id="P11178_3376632" name="P11178_3376632">9</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</p>
</ul><p>There arose against them the war of pagans like a tempest;</p>
<ul><p>But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p>
</ul><p>They were required to sacrifice to lifeless images,</p>
<ul><p>But they departed not from their confession of the Son of God.</p>
</ul><p>The wind of idolatry blew in their faces,</p>
<ul><p>But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p>
</ul><p>Like a swift whirlwind, error snatched at them;</p>
<ul><p>But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</p>
</ul></ul><p>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</p>
<p>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</p>
<ul><p>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</p>
<ul><p>Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p>
</ul><p>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn111.htm#P11194_3377511" id="P11194_3377511" name="P11194_3377511">10</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>How they went up from the contest covered with glory?</p>
<ul><p>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</p>
<ul><p>Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p>
</ul><p>The judge menaced <i>them</i>, and multiplied his words of threatening;</p>
<ul><p>And recounted tortures and all <i>kinds of</i> inflictions, that he might terrify them.</p>
</ul><p>He spake great words,<sup><a href="footnote/fn112.htm#P11202_3377904" id="P11202_3377904" name="P11202_3377904">11</a></sup> that by fright and intimidation,</p>
<ul><p>By menaces too, he might incline them to sacrifice. </p>
</ul><p>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</p>
<ul><p>And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</p>
</ul><p>And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,</p>
<ul><p>And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</p>
</ul><p>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all evil things,</p>
<ul><p>And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</p>
</ul><p>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</p>
<ul><p>Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to sacrifice.</p>
</ul><p>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:</p>
<ul><p>For they knew that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;</p>
</ul><p>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</p>
<ul><p>The more did they show their contempt of him, having no fear of his threats.</p>
</ul><p>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</p>
</ul><p>And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</p>
<ul><p>By those things which he told <i>them</i> he tried to frighten them to sacrifice;</p>
<ul><p>And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p>
</ul><p>Truth is wiser than wise words,</p>
<ul><p>And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is falsehood.</p>
</ul><p>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking truth,</p>
<ul><p>While the judge continued to utter falsehood.</p>
</ul><p>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,</p>
</ul><p>Because all his menaces against the truth were accounted <i>by them</i> as empty sound.<sup><a href="footnote/fn112.htm#P11227_3379378" id="P11227_3379378" name="P11227_3379378">12</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>The intercourse of the world they despised, they contemned and scorned, yea they abandoned;</p>
<ul><p>And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it <i>again</i>.</p>
</ul><p>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart</p>
<ul><p>To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</p>
</ul><p>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,</p>
<ul><p>Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of evil.</p>
</ul><p>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with God,</p>
</ul><p>And to "that" country did they set their face to depart;</p>
<ul><p>And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge</p>
<ul><p>To let them pass over to God, for whom they were longing.</p>
</ul><p>This world they accounted as a little tent,</p>
<ul><p>But that yonder as a city full of beauties;</p>
</ul><p>And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence</p>
</ul><p>To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are worthy of it.</p>
<ul><p>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,</p>
<ul><p>And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</p>
</ul><p>A demon's fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,</p>
<ul><p>And embittered him against the stedfast ones, <i>inciting him</i> to crush them;</p>
</ul><p>And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict them:</p>
<ul><p>And they were a marvel to both sides, <i>when they saw</i> how much they endured.</p>
</ul><p>At the old men's frame heaven and earth marvelled,</p>
<ul><p><i>To see</i> how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under <i>their</i> affliction.</p>
</ul><p>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,</p>
</ul><p>Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or that murmurs.</p>
<ul><p>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,</p>
<ul><p><i>To see</i> how <i>calmly</i> the outstretched forms bore the inflictions <i>laid upon them</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn112.htm#P11258_3381008" id="P11258_3381008" name="P11258_3381008">13</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>Amazed too was Satan at their spotless frames,</p>
<ul><p><i>To see</i> what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</p>
</ul><p>Yea, and gladdened too were the angels by that fortitude of <i>theirs</i>,</p>
<ul><p><i>To see</i> how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</p>
</ul><p>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,</p>
<ul><p>There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</p>
</ul><p>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:</p>
</ul><p>But the noble men <i>before him</i> felt no weariness in their afflictions.</p>
<ul><p>He asked them whether they would consent to sacrifice;</p>
<ul><p>But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</p>
</ul><p>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,</p>
<ul><p>Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken. </p>
</ul><p>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</p>
<ul><p>But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with fortitude from itself.</p>
</ul><p>Alas for the persecutors! how destitute were they of righteousness!</p>
<ul><p>But the children of light-how were they clad in faith!</p>
</ul><p>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,</p>
<ul><p>Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</p>
</ul><p>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable</p>
</ul><p>To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</p>
<ul><p>And what should the martyr do, who had no power to say,</p>
<ul><p>When he was questioned, that he would not sacrifice?</p>
</ul><p>All silent were the old men full of faith,</p>
<ul><p>And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</p>
</ul><p>Yet questioned they were: and in what way, if a man is silent</p>
<ul><p>When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</p>
</ul><p>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</p>
<ul><p>Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behoved them to speak.</p>
</ul><p>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed</p>
<ul><p>The resolve of the new man that was within.</p>
</ul><p>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains</p>
<ul><p>That they were not going to sacrifice, and every one understood their meaning.</p>
</ul><p>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;</p>
<ul><p>But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spake with a dumb sign.</p>
</ul><p>Of faith they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</p>
</ul><p>So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were <i>alike</i> stedfast.</p>
<ul><p>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</p>
<ul><p>And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</p>
</ul><p>Who but must marvel <i>to see</i> that, when the will is watchful and ready,</p>
<ul><p>It is very broad and full of light to him that goeth therein?</p>
</ul><p>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;</p>
</ul><p>And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.</p>
<ul><p>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,</p>
<ul><p>And on "Yea" and "Nay" stand<sup><a href="footnote/fn113.htm#P11307_3383669" id="P11307_3383669" name="P11307_3383669">14</a></sup> sin and righteousness.</p>
</ul><p>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not sacrifice,</p>
<ul><p>And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to Eden;</p>
</ul><p>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</p>
<ul><p>Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</p>
</ul><p>Upwards they made a sign, <i>to signify</i> that upwards were they prepared to ascend;</p>
<ul><p>And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</p>
</ul><p>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</p>
</ul><p>They made a sign that they would not sacrifice, and they inherited the place of the kingdom.</p>
<ul><p>Even while they were Silent they were advocates for the Son of God:</p>
<ul><p>For not in multitude of words doth faith consist.</p>
</ul><p>That fortitude of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</p>
<ul><p>And as though with open mouth declared they <i>their</i> faith by signs;</p>
</ul><p>And every one knew what they were saying, though silent,</p>
<ul><p>And enriched and increased was the faith of the house of God;</p>
</ul><p>And error was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spake not,</p>
<ul><p>Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their faith stood fast.</p>
</ul><p>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</p>
<ul><p>And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</p>
</ul><p>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</p>
<ul><p>And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</p>
</ul><p><i>Yet</i> null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the judge,</p>
<ul><p>And without speech the mute sign of the martyrs bore off the palm.</p>
</ul><p>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;</p>
<ul><p>And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;</p>
</ul><p>And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,</p>
<ul><p>The head of faith was lifted up, and error was put to shame. </p>
</ul><p>Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to the silent:</p>
</ul><p>For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of faith.</p>
<ul><p>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</p>
<ul><p>And they put them in bonds, threatening <i>yet</i> to vanquish them.</p>
</ul><p>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the martyrs</p>
<ul><p>Held of no account-yea <i>rather</i> as the light which has no end.</p>
</ul><p><i>To be</i> without bread, and without water, and without light,</p>
</ul><p>Pleased them well, because of the love of the Son of God.</p>
<ul><p>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up</p>
<ul><p>With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:</p>
</ul><p>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he prayed</p>
<ul><p><i>In</i> prayer pure and strained clear by pain.</p>
</ul><p>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,</p>
<ul><p>And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.</p>
</ul><p>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his faith;</p>
<ul><p>Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his prayer over his deed.</p>
</ul><p>For, prayer nothing whatsoever turneth aside,</p>
<ul><p>And <i>nothing</i> hindereth it-not even sword, not even fire.</p>
</ul><p>His form was turned upside down, but <i>his</i> prayer was unrestrained,</p>
<ul><p>And straight was its path on high to the abode of the angels.</p>
</ul><p>The more the affliction of the chosen martyr was increased,</p>
<ul><p>The more from his lips was all confession heard.</p>
</ul><p>The martyrs longed for the whetted sword affectionately,</p>
</ul><p>And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</p>
<ul><p>A new work has the Son of God wrought in the world-</p>
<ul><p>That dreadful death should be yearned for<sup><a href="footnote/fn113.htm#P11364_3386885" id="P11364_3386885" name="P11364_3386885">15</a></sup> by many.</p>
</ul><p>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,</p>
<ul><p>Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.</p>
</ul><p>That death is bitter, every one knoweth lo! from earliest time:</p>
<ul><p>To martyrs alone is it not bitter to be slain.</p>
</ul><p>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,</p>
<ul><p>And greeted it with smiles: for it was that which was the occasion of their crowns.</p>
</ul><p>As though it had been something hated, they left the body to be beaten:</p>
<ul><p>Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</p>
</ul><p>For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:</p>
<ul><p>Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they desired.</p>
</ul><p>The Son of God slew death by His crucifixion;</p>
</ul><p>And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the martyrs.</p>
<ul><p>With a wounded serpent one playeth without fear;</p>
<ul><p>A slain lion even a coward will drag along:</p>
</ul><p>The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;</p>
<ul><p>The dread lion did the Son of God slay by His sufferings.</p>
</ul><p>Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of Hades;</p>
<ul><p>And <i>now</i> whosoever will draweth near and mocketh at him, because he is slain.</p>
</ul><p>These old men, Shamuna and Guria, mocked at death,</p>
<ul><p>As at that lion which by the Son of God was slain.</p>
</ul><p>The great serpent, which slew Adam among the trees,</p>
<ul><p><i>Who</i> could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?</p>
</ul><p>The Son of God crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,</p>
<ul><p>And lo! boys and old men mock at the wounded serpent.</p>
</ul><p>Pierced is the lion with the spear which<i> pierced</i> the side of the Son of God;</p>
</ul><p>And whosoever will trampleth on him, yea mocketh at him.</p>
<ul><p>The Son of God-He is the cause of all good things,</p>
<ul><p>And Him doth it behove every mouth to celebrate.</p>
</ul><p>He did Himself espouse<sup><a href="footnote/fn113.htm#P11396_3388627" id="P11396_3388627" name="P11396_3388627">16</a></sup> the bride with the blood which flowed from His wounds,</p>
<ul><p>And of His wedding-friends He demanded as a nuptial gift<sup><a href="footnote/fn113.htm#P11398_3388764" id="P11398_3388764" name="P11398_3388764">17</a></sup> the blood of their necks.</p>
</ul><p>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,</p>
<ul><p>And whosoever came to be a guest, He let fall His blood upon him. </p>
</ul><p>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies for His sake</p>
<ul><p>To sufferings and tomes and to all the various forms of woe.<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11403_3389111" id="P11403_3389111" name="P11403_3389111">18</a></sup> </p>
</ul><p>At Him they looked as He was mocked by wicked men,</p>
</ul><p>And thus did they themselves endure mockery without a groan.</p>
<ul><p>Edessa was enriched by your slaughter, O blessed ones:</p>
<ul><p>For ye adorned her with your crowns and with your sufferings.</p>
</ul><p>Her beauty are ye, her bulwark ye, her salt ye,</p>
<ul><p>Her riches and her store, yea her boast and all her treasure.</p>
</ul><p>Faithful stewards are ye:<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11412_3389530" id="P11412_3389530" name="P11412_3389530">19</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>Since by your sufferings ye did array the bride in beauty.</p>

<ul><p>Of <i>you</i> maketh her boast: since by your teaching lo! she was enlightened.</p>
</ul><p>Her advocates are ye; scribes who, though silent, vanquished</p>
</ul><p>All error, whilst its voice was uplifted high in unbelief.</p>
<ul><p>Those old men<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11421_3390089" id="P11421_3390089" name="P11421_3390089">21</a></sup> of the daughter of the Hebrews were sons of Belial,<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11422_3390163" id="P11422_3390163" name="P11422_3390163">22</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p>False witnesses, who killed Naboth, feigning themselves <i>to be true</i>.</p>
</ul><p>Her did Edessa outdo by her two old men full of beauty,</p>
<ul><p>Who were witnesses to the Son of God, and died like Naboth.</p>
</ul><p>Two were there, and two here, old men;</p>
<ul><p>And these were called witnesses, and witnesses those.</p>
</ul><p>Let us now see which of them were witnesses chosen of God,</p>
<ul><p>And which city is beloved by reason of her old men and of her honourable ones.</p>
</ul><p>Lo! the sons of Belial who slew Naboth are witnesses;</p>
<ul><p>And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are witnesses.</p>
</ul><p>Let us now see which witnesses, and which old men,</p>
<ul><p>And which city can stand with confidence<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11434_3391006" id="P11434_3391006" name="P11434_3391006">23</a></sup> before God.</p>
</ul><p>Sons of Belial were those witnesses of that adulterous woman,</p>
<ul><p>And lo! their shame is all portrayed in their names.</p>
</ul><p>Edessa's just and righteous old men, her witnesses,</p>
<ul><p>Were like Naboth, who himself also was slain for righteousness' sake.</p>
</ul><p>They were not like the two lying sons of Belial,</p>
<ul><p>Nor is Edessa like Zion, which also crucified <i>the Lord</i>.</p>
</ul><p>Like herself her old men were false, yea dared</p>
<ul><p>To shed on the ground innocent blood wickedly.</p>
</ul><p><i>But</i> by these witnesses here lo! the truth is spoken.-</p>
<ul><p>Blessed be He who gave us the treasure-store of their crowns!</p>
