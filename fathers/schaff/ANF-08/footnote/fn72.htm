<p><a name="P7201_2180516"></a>
<sup>77 </sup>Ornamenta; another MS. has armamenta.</p>
<p><a name="P7205_2181064"></a>
<sup>78 </sup>Or, of all the wicked.</p>
<p><a name="P7213_2184112"></a>
<sup>79 </sup>The text has deo, God, obviously a misprint for oleo, oil.</p>
<p><a name="P7218_2185024"></a>
<sup>80 </sup>Or, who wearest such (things) on thy body. </p>
<p><a name="P7229_2187839"></a>
<sup>81 </sup>Hopitio.</p>
<p><a name="P7230_2188251"></a>
<sup>82 </sup>Proecuncitus, corrected to proeconatus or ans. </p>
<p><a name="P7239_2191120"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>Momordidit infernum, which is obviously corrput. The translator may have read <font face="SPIonic">dedhxe a#|dhn</font>, but Hades, for <font face="SPIonic">dedeixe a#|dhn</font>, brought Hades to light. </p>
<p><a name="P7257_2193735"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[Compare the translation of the letter of Pilate to Claudius, found in the Acts of Peter and Paul; also a similar letter incorporated in The Gospel of Nicodemus, second part, Latin, first version, chap. 13 (29), p. 454.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P7271_2195434"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Or, Augustus.</p>
<p><a name="P7274_2195842"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Or, Augustus.</p>
<p><a name="P7275_2198111"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Codex A has a better reading-arteries. [The MS. here referred to is in Paris, of the fourteenth century (a.d. 1315).-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P7279_2199893"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The text here is very corrupt.</p>
<p><a name="P7281_2200868"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Or, so men appeared on high.</p>
<p><a name="P7283_2201795"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This sentence also is very corrupt.</p>
<p><a name="P7284_2201847"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Another and more probably reading is, not one. [So B, a Paris MS. of the fourteenth century.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P7294_2205182"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>This is a conjecture of Thilo's. The MSS. have Spania. </p>
<p><a name="P7298_2206250"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Instead of this last sentence, one of the MSS. has: And the whole world was shaken by unspeakable miracles, and all the creation was like to be swallowed up by the lower regions; so that also the sanctuary of their temple was rent from top to bottom. And again there was thunder, and a mighty noise from heaven, so that all our land shook and trembled. Another: And there began to be earthquakes in the hour in which the nails were fixed in Jesus' hands and feet, until evening.</p>
