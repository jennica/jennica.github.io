<sup>2 </sup>For this use of <font face="SPIonic">pneu/mata</font> as applied to the senses, we may cite Plutarch (<i>De placitis philosophorum</i>, iv. 21), who, speaking with reference to the Stoic philosophy, says, <font face="SPIonic">h\ me=n o!rasij e0sti\ pneu=ma diatei=non a0po\ tou= h\gemonikou= me/xrij o0fqalmw=n</font>.</p>

<sup>6 </sup>This name, occurring once again in the <i>Testaments</i> (<i>Naph</i>. 3), is one frequently found applied to the angels as the custodians of the world and of men. Thus, in the Chaldee of Daniel (iv. 10, 14, 20:13, 17, 23, Eng. Ver.), we find the expression <font face="SPTiberian">ry(</font></p>
<p> which Aquila and Svmmachus render <font face="SPIonic">e0grh\goroj</font>. The corresponding Ethiopic term is of frequent occurrence in the book of Enoch, not only of the fallen angels (e.g., x. 9, 15, xvi. 1, etc.), but of the good (xii. 2, 3, etc., ed. Dillmann). See also Gesenius, <i>Thesaurus, s.v.</i> <font face="SPTiberian">ry(</font></p>

<sup>2 </sup>That Simeon was prominent in the hostility to Joseph, is perhaps implied by his detention in Egypt as a surety for the return of the others: and Jewish tradition generally accords with this view. Cf. the Targum of the Pseudo- Jonathan on Gen. xxxvii. 19: "Simeon and Levi, who were brothers in counsel, said one to another, Let us kill him." Also this same Targum on Gen. xlii. 24: "And he took from them Simeon, who had counselled to kill him." Cf. also <i>Breshith Rabba</i>, §91.</p>

<sup>5 </sup>The Cam. ms.. seems wrongly to omit the negative here. The reference is doubtless to Gen. xlix. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P365_51399"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The reference seems to be to the Philistines, Cf Deut. ii. 23, Amos ix. 7 where the LXX. reads <font face="SPIonic">Kappadoki/a</font>.</p>

<sup>8 </sup>This document, the idea of which is that of a book containing what is fore-ordained in heaven as to the course of the future, is one often appealed to in Apocalyptic literature, when some oracular declaration of weighty import is needed. Thus, in the Book of Enoch, the angel Uriel tells Enoch that the tablets contain all wisdom, the dying Enoch tells his children that the tablets are the source of all understanding etc. (see, e.g., cc. 81. 1; 93. 2; 106, 19, ed. Dillmann). In the Book of Jubilees, again, it is said that inscribed on the tablets are, e.g., the punishment of the angels who sinned with mortal women, the plan of the division of weeks, the name of Abraham as the friend of God, etc. (cc. 5, 6, 19). See also <i>Test. Asher</i>, 2, 7, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p><a name="P395_60366"></a>
<sup>10 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a0spi/j</font>. The Latin version gives the other meaning to <font face="SPIonic">a0spi/j</font> here, of asp or viper. The epithet <font face="SPIonic">xalkh=n</font>, however, renders "shield" much more probable, as there seems nothing in the context pointing to the "brazen serpent."</p>
<p><a name="P396_61891"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>A quotation from I Thess. ii. 16, where the context also is similar to the present. [See Lardner's refutation of the learned Grabe on this quotation, vol. ii. p. 359.]</p>
<p><a name="P399_62867"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>With the whole of this passage we may compare the description of the vestments of Aaron. See especially Ex. xxix. 5, 6 (LXX.). The <font face="SPIonic">pe/talon</font> is the translation of <font face="SPTiberian">Cyc</font></p>
<p>, the plate of gold on the fore head of the high priest over the mitre. The <font face="SPIonic">logi/on</font>, or <font face="SPIonic">logei=on</font>, is the breastplate, with the Urim and Thummim. For the <font face="SPIonic">podh/rhj</font>, see Ex. xxviii, 27 (LXX.).</p>
