<sup>31 </sup>[This view of the Scriptures, as held by Peter, is one of the marked characteristics of the <i>Homilies</i>.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P3607_1117592"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>The text has <font face="SPIonic">u9po/</font>, "by," which has been altered into <font face="SPIonic">u9pe/r</font>. Davis would read <font face="SPIonic">sou</font>, "by you."</p>
<p><a name="P3611_1118574"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>Cotelerius doubts whether this expression means a soul ruling over his body, or a soul disposed to favor monarchical rule. The former explanation seems more probable.</p>
<p><a name="P3618_1119943"></a>
<sup>34 </sup>Wieseler considers this corrupt, and amends: "if He desires more."</p>
<p><a name="P3622_1121373"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>The Latin has here, "imperceptus et perceptus;" but Wieseler points out that <font face="SPIonic">xwrou/menoj</font> has reference to God's dwelling in the souls of the good, and thus He is contained by them. </p>
<p><a name="P3641_1124864"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>This is quoted three times in the <i>Homilies</i> as a saying of our Lord, viz., here and in Homily III. Chap. 50, and Homily XVIII. Chap. 20. It is probably taken from one of the apocryphal Gospels. In Homily XVIII. Chap. 20 the meaning is shown to be, that as it is the part of a money-changer to distinguish spurious coins from genuine, so it is part of a Christian to distinguish false statements from true.</p>
<p><a name="P3642_1125525"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>A corruption of the texts, Matt. xxii. 29, Mark xii. 24.</p>
<p><a name="P3646_1126088"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>Gen. vii. 1. </p>
<p><a name="P3658_1127480"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[The first twenty-eight chapters of this homily have no exact parallel in the <i>Recognitiopns</i>; much of the matter is peculiar to this work.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P3674_1132438"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>The text manifestly corrupt.</p>
<p><a name="P3675_1132641"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Perhaps, rather, "the greatest part." </p>
