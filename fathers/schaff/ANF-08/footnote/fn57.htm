<p><a name="P5701_1666984"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>An emendation of Wieseler's. The parts in italics are supplied by conjecture.</p>
<p><a name="P5702_1668037"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>We should have expected "standing near" or something similar, as Weiseler remarks; but the Latin of the Recognitions agrees with the Greek in having the simple "standing." </p>
<p><a name="P5709_1669732"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>Amended according to Epitome.</p>
<p><a name="P5710_1669828"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>Partly filled up from Epitome and Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5711_1670297"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>MS. reads, "I preach."</p>
<p><a name="P5715_1671727"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>We have changed <font face="SPIonic">ei\de</font> into <font face="SPIonic">ei\ke</font>, and added <font face="SPIonic">kai\ ei\pe</font>, according to the Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5716_1671973"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>One word, <font face="SPIonic">tu/xhj</font>, is superfluous.</p>
<p><a name="P5717_1672345"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>Supplied from the Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5721_1672595"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>We read <font face="SPIonic">e0pithdeio/tata</font>, in harmony with the Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5722_1672704"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>Part in italics supplied from Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5723_1673522"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>The Greek is probably corrupt here; but there can scarcely be a doubt about the meaning. </p>
<p><a name="P5727_1674152"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>This is supplied purely by conjecture.</p>
<p><a name="P5732_1675257"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>Supplied from the Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5733_1675403"></a>
<sup>69 </sup>This part is restored by means of the Recognitions.</p>
<p><a name="P5734_1676012"></a>
<sup>70 </sup>[The narrative in the Recognitions (x. 65) is the same up to this point. But, instead of this somewhat abrupt conclusion of this chapter, we find there several chapters (from the close of chap. 65 to the end, chap. 72), which round out the story: the confession of the father in his metamorphosis, his restoration, the Apostle's entry into Antioch, his miracles there, with the happy re-union of the entire family of Clement as believers. It should be added, as indicating the close relation of the two narratives, that the closing sentence of the Homilies is found, with slight variations, in Recognitions, x. 18.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P5755_1678972"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Schaff-Herzog, i. p. 105. </p>
<p><a name="P5757_1680189"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>In most cases the vocabulary of the books furnishes positive evidence of the late origin. A great number of terms can be traced to a particular period of ecclesiastical development, while the dogmatic tendencies which point to a given (And comparatively late) period of controversy are frequent and obvious. </p>
<p><a name="P5769_1684517"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[James the Lord's brother, in the earlieest Christian literature, is not identified with James the son of Alphaeus, one of the twelve. On the titles, see footnote on first page of text.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P5787_1690564"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>[The numbers here correspond with those of Tischendorf in his prolegomena. In his table of contents, however, he gives a separate number to the letter of Pilate, which closes XIII. Hence the enumeration differs from that point.-R.] </p>
