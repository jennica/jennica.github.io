<p><a name="P5300_1554172"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>Gen. xli. 5, ff.</p>
<p><a name="P5301_1554282"></a>
<sup>42 </sup>Gen. xli. 25.</p>
<p><a name="P5302_1554411"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>Dan. ii. 31.</p>
<p><a name="P5303_1554472"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>Lit., of the whole length of the age.</p>
<p><a name="P5304_1554765"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>Dan. iii. 52.</p>
<p><a name="P5305_1555074"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>We have amended this passage. The text applies the words "natural or innate and pure" to the mind.</p>
<p><a name="P5309_1555517"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>Matt. xvi. 13.</p>
<p><a name="P5310_1555715"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>Matt. xvi. 16.</p>
<p><a name="P5311_1556001"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>This word is not in the text. Schliemann proposed the word "heart." Possibly "breath" or "spirit" may be the lost word. See above.</p>
<p><a name="P5312_1556168"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>"By" should properly be "from."</p>
<p><a name="P5313_1556346"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Lit., "who produces according to the merit of easch one knowing." Cotelerius translated, "who, knowing the merit of each man, does to him according to it." The idea seems to be, that God uncovers the truth hidden in the soul to each man according to his deserts.</p>
<p><a name="P5314_1556847"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>Num. xii. 6, 7; Ex. xxxiii. 11. </p>
<p><a name="P5318_1558312"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>Matt. xvi. 18.</p>
<p><a name="P5319_1558618"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>We have adopted an emendation of Schwegler's. The text reads, "in good repute." [The word "condemned" is supposed to be borrowed from the account of the contest at Antioch in Gal. ii. 11, where it is applied to the Apostle Peter. This passage has therefore been regarded as a covert attack upon the Apostle Paul.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P5323_1559640"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>This passage is corrupt in the text. Dressel reads, "that activity is more distincy than apparition." By activity would be meant, "acting while one is awake, and in full possession of his sense;" and thus the meaning would be neraly the same as in our translation. </p>
<p><a name="P5332_1561105"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Matt. xix. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P5333_1561281"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>[Comp. xvii. 5, and Recognitions, iii. 37, 38.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P5337_1561938"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>There is a lacuna in one of the MSS. here, which is supplied in various ways. We have inserted the word "goods." </p>
<p><a name="P5338_1562961"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>This translation is doubtful. More correctly it would be, "by gratifying different people," which does not make sense. Wieseler proposes, "by gratifying in differen ways."</p>
<p><a name="P5342_1563976"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>The text seems corrupt here. Literally it is, "from Moses to the present times, as has been written, He is just also."</p>
<p><a name="P5343_1564459"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Luke xviii. 18, ff.; Matt. xix. 16, ff.</p>
<p><a name="P5347_1565529"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Matt. xi. 27; [Luke x. 22. Comp. Homily XVII. 4; Recognitions, ii. 47, 48. The discussion here is much fuller.-R.].</p>
<p><a name="P5348_1566025"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Lam. iii .38.</p>
<p><a name="P5352_1567819"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>The words in italics are inserted to fill up a lacuna which occurs here in the Vatican MS. </p>
<p><a name="P5359_1570384"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The Greek has "but."</p>
<p><a name="P5367_1572982"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>[The remainder of the Homily is without a close parallel in the Recognitious.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P5368_1573100"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>Lit., "caught in the act." </p>
<p><a name="P5369_1573495"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>This passage is deemed corrupt by commentators. We have made no change in the reading of the MSS., except that of <font face="SPIonic">nenikhme/nhn</font> into <font face="SPIonic">nenikhme/noj</font>, and perhaps even this is unnecessary. The las tsentence means: "A man may overcome the weakness of his adversary: but he does not therefore strip him of the truh, which he possesses even when he is conquered." The Latin translation of Cotelerius, with some emendations from later editors, yields this: "But they say that I, a magician, am not merely conquered by Peter, but reduced to straits by reasoning, has he the truth which is in him conquered. For the weakness of the defender is not the truth of the conqueror."</p>
<p><a name="P5379_1577072"></a>
<sup>14 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Kuri/a</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P5380_1577342"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>The text is corrupt. various emendations have been proposed, none of which are satisfactory. Uhlhorn proposes, "That there is a standing one, one who will tsand. You who are opposed, leran how you disbelieve, and that this subject which you say is the power unrevealed is full of ignorance. P. 328, note 1. </p>
<p><a name="P5387_1580318"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>The text is corrupt. We have placed <font face="SPIonic">dia/ to/</font> after <font face="SPIonic">ei0de/nai</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P5388_1580719"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>Another reading is: "Were not those deemed better wrothy than any one else to know Him?"</p>
<p><a name="P5393_1581551"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>Matt. xi. 25; [Luke x. 21; comp. Recognitions, iv. 5].</p>
<p><a name="P5394_1582117"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>The passage does not occur in Isaiah, but in Ps. lxxviii. 2. The words are quoted not from the LXX., but from the Gospel of Matthew (xiii. 35), where in some MSS. they are attributed to Isaiah. See Uhlhorn, p. 119.</p>
<p><a name="P5395_1582872"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>The words in italics are omitted in the MSS.; but the context leaves no doubt that they were once in the text.</p>
<p><a name="P5399_1583454"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>Luke xi. 52.</p>
