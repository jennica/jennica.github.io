<sup>23 </sup>Cureton, "were assembled and standing;" nearly as Euseb.: <font face="SPIonic">paro/ntwn kai\ e0stw/twn</font>. But in 2 Sam. xx. 1, the only reference given by Castel for the word   is used for the Heb. <font face="SPTiberian">)rqn</font></p>
<p>, "he chanced."-TR.</p>
<p><a name="P9601_3071252"></a>
<sup>24 </sup> , like the <font face="SPIonic">proseku/nhse</font> of Eusebius, may be rendered "worshipped."-TR.</p>
<p><a name="P9602_3071719"></a>
<sup>25 </sup> ; Gr. <font face="SPIonic">mega/lwj</font>, lit. "greatly;" C. "nobly." But nothing more than intensity is necessarily denoted by either word. Compae, for the Syriac, Ps. cxix. 107, 167; Dan. ii. 12.-TR.</p>
<p><a name="P9603_3072271"></a>
<sup>26 </sup>Compare the letters of Abgar and Tiberius, infra. </p>
<p><a name="P9604_3072522"></a>
<sup>27 </sup>In another piece, The Teaching of Addoeus, i.e., Thaddaeus, we have a portion of the original Syriac from which Eusebius' translation was made. The only portions that correspond are: in the present piece, from this place to "-accept that of others," near the end; and, in the following one, from the beginning to "- that which is note ours." Some of the variations are worthy of notice.</p>
<p><a name="P9605_3073287"></a>
<sup>28 </sup>See note 9, p. 657, infra.</p>
<p><a name="P9606_3073392"></a>
<sup>29 </sup>This answers sufficiently well to the Greek: <font face="SPIonic">o0j kai\ au0to/j proselqw/n u0po\ tou\j po/daj au0tou= e!pesen</font>; but, as the original Syriac, p. 12, reads "he too brought his feet to him, and he laid his hands upon them and healed him," the Greek translation must have been at fault. For brought read presented.-TR.</p>
<p><a name="P9609_3074245"></a>
<sup>30 </sup>The original Syriac has "I will not hold my peace from delclaring this."</p>
<p><a name="P9610_3074587"></a>
<sup>31 </sup>So Euseb. The orig. Syr. has "His sender."</p>
<p><a name="P9611_3074839"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>The orig. Syr. has "the certitude of His preaching." The error seems to have arisen from the Greek translator confounding   with  . More probably with  , "newness (of his preaching)," which was freely translated by him (<font face="SPIonic">peri</font>) <font face="SPIonic">th=j kainh=j au0tou= khru/cewj</font>; and this, again, was by the Syrian re-translator rendered literally, as in the text. The word certitude (above) may be rendered unerring truth. -TR.</p>
<p><a name="P9612_3075390"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>Or "Sheol," as in Hebrew. The orig. Syr. gives "the place of the dead."</p>

<sup>36 </sup>Valesius says that the Edessenes commenced their era with the 117th Olympiad, the first year of the reign of Seleucus. The year 340 corresponds, therefore, with the fifteenth year of Tiberius. It should eb the beginning of the 117th Olympiad.-TR. </p>
