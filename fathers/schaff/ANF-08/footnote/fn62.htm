<sup>78 </sup>One of the MSS. has: And when Joseph, worn out with old age, died and was buried with his parents, the blessed Mary lived with her nephews, or with the chilfdren of her sisters; for Anna and Emerina were sisters. OF Emerina was born Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. And as Anna, the mother of the blessed Mary, was very beautiful, when Joachim was dead she was married to Cleophas, by whom she had a second daughter. She called her Mary, and gave her to Alphaeus to wife; and of her was born James the son of Alphaeus, and Philip his brother. And her second husband having died, Anna was married to a third husband named Salome, by whom she had a third daughter. She calle dher Mary likewise, and gave her to Zebedee to wife; and of her were born James the son of Zebedee, and John the Evangelist.</p>
<p>Another passage to the same effect is prefixed to the Gospel. It reads Emeria for Emerina, and Josph for Philip. It ends with a quotation from Jerome's sermon upon Easter:-WE read in the Gospels that there were four Marys-first, the mother of the Lord the Saviour; second, His maternal aunt, who was calle dMary of Cleophas; third, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, fourth, Mary Magdalene-though some maintain that the mother of James and Joseph was His aunt.</p>
<p>The same MS. thus concludes: The holy Apostle and Evanglis John with his own hand wrote this little book in Hebrew, and the leraned doctor Jerome rendered it from Hebrew into Latin. </p>

<sup>20 </sup>Here the Coptic has: This is the end of the life of my beloved father Joseph. When forty years old he married a wife, with whom he lived nine (? forty-nine) years. After her death he remained a widower one (or two) year: and my mother lived two years in his house before she was married to him, since he had been ordered by the priests to take charge of her until the time of her marriage. And my mother Mary brought me forth in the third year that she was in Joseph;s house, in the fifteenth year of her age. My mother bore me in a cave (this seems a mistranslation for mystery), which it is unlawful either to name or seek, and there is not in the whole creation a man who knows it, except me and my Father and the Holy Spirit. It is to be noted that the last clause is omitted in the Coptic. The phrase one essence was first used in regard to the doctrine of the Trinity by Augustine. </p>
