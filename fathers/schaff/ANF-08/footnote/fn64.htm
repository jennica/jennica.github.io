<sup>1 </sup>[In this book, the name Zacheus is given in different form, following the Latin.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P6428_1916122"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>A slight alteration is here made upon the punctuation of the original.</p>
<p><a name="P6430_1916776"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>This refers to the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p><a name="P6431_1917488"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Butter, perhaps: And when He began to tell that teacher. </p>
<p><a name="P6432_1917876"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>This passage is hopelessly corrupt. The writer of this Gospel knew very little Greek, and probably the text from which he was translating was also here in a bad state. [Compare the accounts in the versions from the Greek forms.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P6434_1918650"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The Greek original has <font face="SPIonic">mh/tra</font>, which he seems to have confonded with <font face="SPIonic">mh/thr</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P6438_1920328"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Or, on the house.</p>
<p><a name="P6448_1922140"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The modius or modium was almost exactly two gallons.</p>
<p><a name="P6452_1922564"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>But probably architector here is equal to <font face="SPIonic">te/ktwn</font>, a carpenter. </p>
<p><a name="P6453_1922829"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>Perhaps sectum, cut, is the true reading, and not actum.</p>
<p><a name="P6457_1923888"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>This is his translation of <font face="SPIonic">e0pi pollh\n w!ran</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P6458_1924099"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>Here again he makes a mistranslation-<font face="SPIonic">du/namij</font>, fortitudo.</p>
<p><a name="P6463_1925526"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>Some words have been omitted here in the MS., but the sense is obvious enough.</p>
<p><a name="P6471_1927126"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>Luke i. 28. </p>
<p><a name="P6473_1927995"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>This, I think, means: and which their father Israel, i.e. their fathers generally, had not seen. </p>
<p><a name="P6482_1928780"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Or, have found.</p>
<p><a name="P6483_1928914"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>He is called Joseph Caiaphas in Josephys, Antiq., xviii. 2. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P6485_1929459"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>The Latin translation in Tischendorf has Hierosolyma, which, as the form in the rest of the translation is feminine, means "from Jerusalem." But as the Arabic can mean only "to Jerusalem," the acc. plural of the neut. form may be here intended.</p>
<p><a name="P6487_1930446"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Or, with the lights of lamps and candles, more beautiful than lightning, and more splendid than sunlight.</p>
<p><a name="P6490_1932450"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>John xii. 5. The denarius was worth about 7 3/4 d. </p>
<p><a name="P6491_1932700"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Luke vii. 37, 38.</p>
<p><a name="P6492_1932789"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Lev. xii. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P6493_1933043"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Ex. xiii. 2; Luke ii. 23.</p>
<p><a name="P6495_1933767"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>Luke ii. 25-38.</p>
<p><a name="P6497_1933951"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>For this prediction of Zoroaster, see Smith's Dict. of the Bible, art. Magi.</p>
<p><a name="P6498_1934574"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>Matt. ii. 1-12.</p>
