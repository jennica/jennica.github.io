<sup>7 </sup>We have here adopted a conjectural reading of Davis. The common text is thus translated: "whose faces I remember, and who as being living images are satisfactory testimonies. These it is left," etc. </p>
<p><a name="P3404_1061354"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The Vatican ms. and Epit. Have "the power of speaking well."</p>
<p><a name="P3405_1061875"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>Lit., "I met each one beforehand secretly." The Latin has, "unicuique praevius occurri."</p>
<p><a name="P3406_1062198"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The Greek is <font face="SPIonic">biou</font>, "life."</p>
<p><a name="P3407_1062457"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>The Paris ms. reads <font face="SPIonic">fqo/nou</font>, "envy," instead of <font face="SPIonic">fo/nou</font>, "murder." </p>
<p><a name="P3420_1066124"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>[Here the two accounts become again closely parallel.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P3421_1067002"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>The text is corrupt. Dressel's reading is adopted in the text, being based on Rufinus's translation. Some conjecture, "as you will know of your own accord."</p>
<p><a name="P3431_1070515"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>A conjectural reading, "being without the house," seems preferable. </p>
<p><a name="P3435_1071360"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>[Comp. <i>Recognitions</i>, i. 16, where the discourse is more fully given.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P3439_1072837"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>The text is probably corrupt or defective. As it stands, grammatically Peter writes the discourse and sends it, and yet "by his order" must also apply to Peter. The <i>Recognitions</i> make Clement write the book and send it. The passage is deemed important, and is accordingly discussed in Schliemann, p. 83; Hilgenfeld, p. 37; and Uhlhorn, p. 101. [See <i>Recognitions</i>, i. 17. Both passages, despite the variation, may be urged in support of the existence of an earlier document as the common basis of the Clementine literature.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P3446_1076316"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>[Comp. Homily XIII. 4. And <i>Recognitions</i>, i. 19.-R.] </p>
<p><a name="P3455_1076993"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[With but two exceptions, these names, or their equivalents, occur in <i>Recognitions</i>, iii. 68, where importance is attached to the number twelve. Comp. Also <i>Recogntions</i>, ii. 1. A Comparison of these lists favors the theory of a common documentary basis.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P3459_1078095"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Literally, "to be boiled out of me."</p>
<p><a name="P3463_1079021"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Eccles. iii. 1.</p>
<p><a name="P3473_1081196"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>"Were deceived" is not in the text, but the sense demands some such expression should be supplied. </p>
<p><a name="P3480_1083636"></a>
<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">filo/logoi, ou0 filo/sofoi</font>, "lovers of words, not lovers of wisdom." </p>
<p><a name="P3496_1087509"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Lit. Hades.</p>
