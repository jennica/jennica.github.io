<sup>11 </sup>[This chapter has no direct parallel in the <i>Homilies</i>. While there is a general resemblance in the remainder of book i. to Homily 11., much of the matter is peculiar, or at least Introduced in a connection different from that of the <i>Homilies</i>.-R.] </p>

<sup>13 </sup>[Hilgenield regards chaps. 27-72 as as of the Jewish-Christian document called <font face="Semitica Dict">Kerygma Petri</font>, of which an outline is given in book iii. 75. This he thinks was of Roman origin. Certainly these chapters bear many marks of an earlier origin than most of the pseudo-Clementine literature. Much of the matter is not found elsewhere in this literature: the tone of the discourse is much superior; the instruction represented as given to Clement, is quite well adapted to his needs as a heathen inquirer: the views presented are not so extravagant as much that occurs in the <i>Homilies</i>: the attempt to adjust the statements to the New-Testament narrative is skilfully made, and there is not lacking a great vraisemblance, It may not be improper to add, that the impressions first given in regard to this passage were made upon the writer of this note quite independently of Hilgenfeld's theory; some of them committed to writing without a thought of maintaining that theory.-R]</p>

We have given the translation of our authorized version. It is likely, however, that the writer believed the name to Imply that they lived to a great. age, as is maintained by Diodorus quoted by Suicer on the word, or he may have traced the word to <font face="SPIonic">gh=</font>.</p>
