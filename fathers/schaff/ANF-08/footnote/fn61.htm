<sup>59 </sup>Tischendorf thinks that the text is corrupt. But the meaning seems to be: You are not a whit better than your neighbours: for all of you teach what you have named, and you can teach nothing else. But he alone (ipse, i.e., Christ) can teach more who is worthy.</p>

<sup>64 </sup>The original-triangulos gradatos, subacutos, mediatos obductos, productos, erectos, stratos, curvistratos-is hopelessly corrupt. Compare the passages in the following Apocrypha. [The Gospel of Thomas, first Greek form, chaps 6, 7, and parallel passages.-R.] It obviously, hwoever, refers to the Pentalpha, Pentacle, or Solomon's Seal, celebrated in the remains of the magical books that have come down to us under the names of Hermas and the Pythagoreans. The pentalpha was formed by joining by straight lines the alternate angles of a regula rpentagon, and thus contained numerous triangles. The Pythagoreans calle dit the Hygiea or symbol of health, and it was frequently engraved on amulets and coins. it is still, if the books are to be trusted, a symbol of power in the higher grades of freemasonry.</p>
