</ul><p>Of all virgins of either sex who have truly resolved to preserve virginity for the sake of the kingdom of heaven-of each and every one of them it is required that he be worthy of the kingdom of heaven in every thing. For not by eloquence<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P926_243016" id="P926_243016" name="P926_243016">4</a></sup> or renown,<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P927_243162" id="P927_243162" name="P927_243162">5</a></sup> by station<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P928_243203" id="P928_243203" name="P928_243203">6</a></sup> and descent, or by beauty or strength, or by length of life,<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P929_243355" id="P929_243355" name="P929_243355">7</a></sup> is the kingdom of heaven obtained; but it is obtained by the power of faith, when a man exhibits the works of faith. For whosoever is truly righteous, his works testify concerning his faith, that he is truly a believer, with a faith which is great, a faith which is perfect, a faith which is in God, a faith which shines in good works, that the Father of all may be glorified through Christ. Now, those who are truly virgins for the sake of God give heed to Him who hath said, "Let not righteousness and faith fail thee; bind them on thy neck, and thou shall find favour for thyself; and devise thou good things before God and before men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P930_244016" id="P930_244016" name="P930_244016">8</a></sup> "The paths," therefore, "of the righteous shine as the light, and the light of them advances until the day is perfect."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P931_244162" id="P931_244162" name="P931_244162">9</a></sup> For the beams of their light illumine the whole creation even now by good works, as those who are truly "the light of the world,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P932_244324" id="P932_244324" name="P932_244324">10</a></sup> giving light to "those who sit in darkness,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P933_244387" id="P933_244387" name="P933_244387">11</a></sup> that they may arise and go forth from the darkness by the light of the good works of the fear of God, "that they may see our good works and glorify our Father who is in heaven."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P934_244596" id="P934_244596" name="P934_244596">12</a></sup> For it is required of the man of God, that in all his words and works he be perfect, and that in his life he be adorned with all exemplary and well-ordered behaviour,<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P935_244795" id="P935_244795" name="P935_244795">13</a></sup> and do all his deeds in righteousness, as a man of God.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter III.-True Virgins Prove Themselves Such by Self-Denial, as Does the True Believer by Good Works.</font></p>
</ul><p>For virgins are a beautiful pattern to believers, and to those who shall believe. The name alone, indeed, without works, does not introduce into the kingdom of heaven; but, if a man be truly a believer, such an one can be saved. For, if a person be only called a believer in name, whilst he is not such in works, he cannot possibly be a believer. "Let no one," therefore, "lead you astray with the empty words of error."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P939_245425" id="P939_245425" name="P939_245425">14</a></sup> For, merely because a person is called a virgin, if he be destitute of works excellent and comely, and suitable to virginity, he cannot possibly be saved. For our Lord called such virginity as that "foolish," as He said in the Gospel;<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P940_245676" id="P940_245676" name="P940_245676">15</a></sup> and because it had neither oil nor light, it was left outside of the kingdom of heaven, and was shut out from the joy of the bridegroom, and was reckoned with His enemies. For such persons as these "have the appearance only of the fear of God, but the power of it they deny."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P941_245971" id="P941_245971" name="P941_245971">16</a></sup> For they "think with themselves that they are something, whilst they are nothing, and are deceived. But let every one constantly try<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P942_246122" id="P942_246122" name="P942_246122">17</a></sup> his works,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P943_246171" id="P943_246171" name="P943_246171">18</a></sup> and know himself; for empty worship does he offer, whosoever he be that makes profession of virginity and sanctity, "and denies its power." For virginity of such a kind is impure, and disowned by all good works. For "every tree whatsoever is known from its fruits."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P944_246457" id="P944_246457" name="P944_246457">19</a></sup> "See that thou understand<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P945_246535" id="P945_246535" name="P945_246535">20</a></sup> what I say: God will give thee understanding."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P946_246710" id="P946_246710" name="P946_246710">21</a></sup> For whosoever engages before God to preserve sanctity must be girded with all the holy power of God. And, if with true fear<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P947_246853" id="P947_246853" name="P947_246853">22</a></sup> he crucify his body, he for the sake of the fear of God excuses himself from that word <i>in</i> which <i>the Scripture</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P948_247035" id="P948_247035" name="P948_247035">23</a></sup> has said: "Be fruitful, and multiply,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P949_247205" id="P949_247205" name="P949_247205">24</a></sup> and <i>shuns</i> all the display, and care, and sensuality,<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P950_247275" id="P950_247275" name="P950_247275">25</a></sup> and fascination of this world, and its revelries and its drunkenness, and all its luxury and ease, and withdraws from the entire life of<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P951_247445" id="P951_247445" name="P951_247445">26</a></sup> this world, and from its snares, and nets, and hindrances; and, whilst thou walkest<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P952_247566" id="P952_247566" name="P952_247566">27</a></sup> upon the earth, be zealous that thy work and thy business be in heaven.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter IV.-Continuation of the Remarks on Self-Denial; Object and Reward of True Virgins.</font></p>
</ul><p>For he who covets for himself these things <i>so</i> great and excellent, withdraws and severs himself on this account from all the world, that he may go <i>and</i> live a life divine and heavenly, like the holy angels, in work pure and holy, and "in the holiness<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P956_248089" id="P956_248089" name="P956_248089">28</a></sup> of the Spirit of God,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P957_248234" id="P957_248234" name="P957_248234">29</a></sup> and that he may serve God Almighty through Jesus Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. On this account he severs himself from all the appetites of the body. And not only does he excuse himself from this <i>command</i>, "Be fruitful, and multiply," but he longs for the "hope promised" and prepared "and laid up in heaven"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P958_248579" id="P958_248579" name="P958_248579">30</a></sup> by God, who has declared with His mouth, and He does not lie, that it is "better than sons and daughters,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P959_248702" id="P959_248702" name="P959_248702">31</a></sup> and that He will give to virgins a notable place in the house of God, which is <i>something</i> "better than sons and daughters," and better than <i>the place of</i> those who have passed a wedded life in sanctity, and whose "bed has not been defiled."<sup><a href="footnote/fn9.htm#P960_248962" id="P960_248962" name="P960_248962">32</a></sup> For God will give to virgins the kingdom of heaven, as to the holy angels, by reason of this great and noble profession.</p>

Let us, therefore, "ask of the Lord of the harvest" that He would send forth workmen into the harvest;<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1085_270963" id="P1085_270963" name="P1085_270963">130</a></sup> such workmen as "shall skilfully dispense the word of truth; "workmen "who shall not be ashamed; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1086_271086" id="P1086_271086" name="P1086_271086">131</a></sup> faithful workmen; workmen who shall be "the light of the world; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1087_271195" id="P1087_271195" name="P1087_271195">132</a></sup> workmen who "work not for the food that perisheth, but for that food which abideth unto life eternal; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1088_271319" id="P1088_271319" name="P1088_271319">133</a></sup> workmen who shall be such as the apostles; workmen who imitate the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit; who are concerned for the salvation of men; not "hireling"<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1089_271507" id="P1089_271507" name="P1089_271507">134</a></sup> workmen; not workmen to whom the fear of God and righteousness appear to be gain; not workmen who "serve their belly; "not workmen who "with fair speeches and pleasant words mislead the hearts of the innocent; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1090_271742" id="P1090_271742" name="P1090_271742">135</a></sup> not workmen who imitate the children of light, while they are not light but darkness-"men whose end is destruction; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1091_271881" id="P1091_271881" name="P1091_271881">136</a></sup> not workmen who practise iniquity and wickedness and fraud; not "crafty workmen; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1092_271985" id="P1092_271985" name="P1092_271985">137</a></sup> not workmen "drunken" and "faithless; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1093_272047" id="P1093_272047" name="P1093_272047">138</a></sup> nor workmen who traffic in Christ;<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1094_272112" id="P1094_272112" name="P1094_272112">139</a></sup> not misleaders; not "lovers of money; not malevolent."<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1095_272291" id="P1095_272291" name="P1095_272291">140</a></sup> </p>
<p>Let us, therefore, contemplate and imitate the faithful who have conducted themselves well in the Lord, as is becoming and suitable to our calling and profession. Thus let us do service before God in justice and righteousness, and without blemish, "occupying ourselves with things good and comely before God <i>and</i> also before men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn10.htm#P1097_272654" id="P1097_272654" name="P1097_272654">141</a></sup> For this is comely, that God be glorified in us in all things.<i>Here</i> endeth the first Epistle of Clement. </p>
