<sup>111 </sup>Thucydides, (I. 138,) writes of Themistocles that "to a greater degree than any other man he was to be admired for the natural ability which he displayed; for by his inborn capacity, he was an unrivalled judge of what the emergency of the moment required, and unsurpassed in his forecast of he future, and this without the aid of previous or additional instruction."</p>
<p>The same historian (II. 60) records the speech of Pericles in his own vindication in which he says "I think myseIf inferior to none in knowing what measures should be taken and in enforcing them by word of mouth."</p>
<p><a name="P5698_1390407"></a>
<sup>112 </sup>Theoctistus; who, we learn from Letter CXXXIV, did not prove himself a friend in need, succeeded Acacius in 438. Garnerius, apparently on insufficient grounds, would therefore date the letter before this year. </p>
