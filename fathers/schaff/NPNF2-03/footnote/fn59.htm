<sup>248 </sup><font>This letter is placed by Garnerius in the end of 447 on account of its allusion to Proclus, who died in October 447, and to the deposition of Iren`us of Tyre, for which the formal edict was issued in Feb. 448, but which was perhaps rumoured earlier. But by some the death of Proclus is placed a year earlier.</font></p>

<p><a name="P5984_1485785"></a>
<sup>251 </sup>"The phraseology of this letter has given rise to much misapprehension. The use of the first person has led some to suppose that Theodoret, who belonged to another province, was the consecrator of Irenaeus, or that he took part in his consecration, or even with the Abbé Martin (le Pseudo-Synode d'Éphèse, pp. 84, 85) that it is erroneously ascribed to Theodoret, and was really written by Domnus. It is clear from the tenor of the epistle that it was written by Theodoret, and that the first person is employed by him as writing in Domnus' name. (Tillemont xv. pp. 871, 872.)" Dict. Christ. Biog. iii. 281 n.</p>
<p>It is in consonance with this theory that Alexander of Antioch is described as bishop of <i>this</i> apostolic see, a phrase natural for Domnus to use, but not for Theodoret.</p>
<p><a name="P5985_1487268"></a>
<sup>252 </sup>It is uncertain who this Diogenes was; he cannot have been Diogenes of Cyzicus, for he was alive and present at Chalcedon in 451.</p>
<p><a name="P5986_1487491"></a>
<sup>253 </sup>No more is known of Domninus or Praylius. cf. p. 157. "It is clear from the Philosophumena of Hippolytus (ix, 12.) that by the beginning of the third century the rule of monogamy for the clergy was well established, since he complains that in the days of Callistus `digamist and trigamist bishops, priests, and deacons <i>began</i> to be admitted.0'" Dict. Christ. Ant. i. 552.</p>

<sup>255 </sup><font>This letter is in reply to that written by Anatolius on the receipt of Letter XCII. Garnerius, who places the decree of relegation earlier than Tillemont, dates it at about the end of April 448. </font></p>

<sup>256 </sup>The leaders of the attack on Ibas, (bishop of Edessa and metropolitan, in 436) were four presbyters, Samuel, Cyrus, Eulogius, and Maras. The cabal chose the moment for action when Domnus visited Hierapolis for the enthrontzation of Stephen, and in 445 Ibas was summoned by Domnus to Antioch, but did not come. In 448 the eighteen charges - some frivolous, some of gross heresy - were formally heard, and Domnus decided in favor of Ibas. cf. p. 283, note.</p>
<p><a name="P5994_1490448"></a>
<sup>257 </sup>i.e. recommended Ibas not to excommunicate his accusers.</p>

<p><a name="P5999_1492827"></a>
<sup>259 </sup><font>Garnerius points out that the indications of the date of this letter are clear. It mentions the imperial summons to the Latrocinium, and contains Theodoret's advice to Domnus as to what companions he should take with him. It must therefore be placed between the arrival of the summons at Antioch and the departure of Domnus for Ephesus. The summons is dated the 30th of March, and appointed the 1st of August for themeeting. Antioch is a clear thirty days' journey from Ephesusand Domnus had not yet chosen his companions. We may therefore date the letter in the May of 449.</font></p>
