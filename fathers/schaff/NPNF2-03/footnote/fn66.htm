<sup>644 </sup><font>Cyril's party met on June 22, 431, - numbering 198, in the Church of the Virgin. John of Antioch with his fourteen sup. porters did not arrive till the 27th. Unable to start from their diocese before April 26, the octave of Easter, they did not assemble at Antioch till May 10, and then were delayed by a famine.

<sup>653 </sup><font>The Latin version of the title begins <i>"Relatio orientalis conciliabuli."</i> So the rival and hurried gathering of the Easterns was styled. The following letter is a further justification of their action, and illustrates the readiness and ability, if not the temper and prudence, of the bishop of Cyrus, its probable author. </font></p>
<p><a name="P6659_1728206"></a>
<sup>654 </sup><font>Written at the same time and under the same circumstances as the former, of which it is an abbreviation, and is consequently omitted.</font></p>

<sup>657 </sup><font>This letter may be dated "towards the end of July or in the beginning of August 431, after the restitution of Cyril and Memnon on July 16, and before the departure of Theodoret from Ephesus on August 20." Garnerius. Andrew of Samosata wrote objections to Cyril's Chapters in the name of the bishops of the East. He was prevented by illness from being present at Ephesus in 431, as he was also from the synod assembled at Antioch in 444 to hear the cause of Athanasius of Perrha. He was a warm supporter of Nestorius.</font></p>
<p>This letter exists only in the Latin Version, and is to be found also in Mansi Collect. Conc. ix. 293.</p>
<p><a name="P6670_1730634"></a>
<sup>658 </sup>In Ep. CLXI, the numbers are specified;-"Of Egyptians fifty; of Asiani under Memnon, leader of the tyranny, forty; of the heretics in Pamphylia called Messalianitae, twelve; besides those attached to the same metropolitan" (i.e. Amphilochius of Side) "and others deposed and excommunicated in divers places by synods or bishops, who constitute nothing but a mere turbulent and disorderly mob, entirely ignorant of the divine decrees."</p>
<p><a name="P6674_1731491"></a>
<sup>659 </sup><font>Another version of the title runs "To the very holy and wise synod assembled at Ephesus, Joannes, Paulus, Apringius, Theodoretus, greeting." The letter may be dated in Sept. 431.
