<sup>54 </sup>The more significant from the fact that Constantius affected a more than human impassibility. Cf. the graphic account of his entry into Rome "velut collo munito rectam aciem luminum tendens, nec dextra vulture nec laeva flectebat, tanquam figmentum hominis: non cum rota concuteret nutans nec spuens aut os aut nasum tergens vel fricans manumve agitans visus est unquam." Amm. Marc. xvi. 10.</p>

<sup>58 </sup>Probably <i>Syrianus,</i> who is described by Athanasius himself as sent to get him removed from Alexandria, but as denying that he had the written authority of Constantius. This was in Jan. a.d. 356.</p>

<sup>62 </sup>Georgius, a fraudulent contractor of Constantinople (Ath. <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 75), made Arian Bishop of ALexandria on the expulsion of Athanasius, in a.d. 356, was born in a fuller's shop at Epiphania in Cilicia. (Amm. Marc. xxii. 11, 3.) He was known as "the Cappadocian," and further illustrates the old saying of "<font face="SPIonic">Kappadokej Krhtej Kilikej, tria kappa kakiosta</font><font>," and the kindred epigram</font></p>
<ul><ul><p><font face="SPIonic">Kappadokhn pot' exidna kakh daken: alla kai auth</font></p>

</ul></ul><p>The crimes of the brutal "Antipope" (Prof. Bright in <i>Dict. Christ. Biog.</i>) are many, but he was a book-collector. (Jul. Ep. ix. 36, cf. Gibbon 1. Chap. 23.) Gibbon says "the infamous George of Cappadocia has been transformed into the renowned St. George of England;" an identity sufficiently disproved.</p>

<sup>65 </sup>One Ammonius had been consecrated by Alexander, and was bishop ot Pacnemunis (Ath. <i>ad Drac.</i> 210, and <i>Hist. Ar.</i> §72). Another was apparently consecrated by Athanasius (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §72). An Ammonius was banished to the Upper Oasis (id.). Caius was the orthodox bishop of Thmuis. Philo was banished to Babylon (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §72, cf. Jer. <i>Vita Hilarionis</i> 30). Muïus, Psinosiris, Nilammon, Plenius, Marcus the sees of these two Marci were Zygra and Philae), and Athenodorus, were relegated to the parts about the Libyan Ammon, nine days' journey from Alexandria, only that they might perish on the road. One did die. (<i>Hist Ar.</i> §72.) Adelphius was bishop of Onuphis in the Delta, and was sent to the Thebaid (Tom. ad Ant. 615.) Dracontius, to whom Athanasius addressed a letter, went to the deserts about Clysma (25 m. s.w. of Suez), and Hierax and Dioscorus to Syene (Assouan (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §72), whither Trajan had banished Juvenal.</p>

<sup>69 </sup>Athanasius was condemned at Arles (353) as well as at Milan in 355. At the latter place Constantius affected more than his father's infallibility, and exclaimed, "What I will, be that a Canon." Ath. <i>Hist. Ar.</i> §33.</p>

<sup>70 </sup><i>Apol. de fug.</i> §4 and §5.</p>

<sup>71 </sup>For the persecution and vacillation of Liberius, "one of the few Popes that can be charged with heresy" (Principal Barmby in <i>Dict. Christ. Biog.</i> s.v.), see also Ath. <i>Hist. Ar.</i> §35 et seqq.</p>

<sup>72 </sup>Treves. Dionysius was the successor of St. Maximinus and a firm champion of orthodoxy. Cf. Sulp. Sev. II. 52.</p>

<sup>74 </sup>Calaris (Cagliari). Luciferus, a vehement defender of Athanasius, was banished to Eleutheropolis in Palestine. Mr. Ll. Davies (<i>Dict. Christ. Biog.</i> s.v.), thinks the traditional story of the imprisonment of Luciferus at Milan, to prevent his outspoken advocacy of Athanasius, shews internal evidence of probability.</p>
<p><a name="P1538_404857"></a>
<sup>75 </sup>Eusebius, bishop of Vercellae (Vercelli), was a staunch Athanasian. He was banished to Scythopolis, where the bishop Patrophilus (cf. Book I. chapter VI. and XX.), a leading Arian, was, he says, his "jailer." (Vide his letters.)</p>
<p><a name="P1539_405395"></a>
<sup>76 </sup>The epithet <font face="SPIonic">eughrotatoj</font><font> felicitously describes the honoured old age of the bishop of Cordova-he was now a hundred years old (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §45)-before his pitiable lapse. He was sent to Sirmium (Mitrovitz). </font></p>

<p><a name="P1547_407900"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>On the question of the orthodoxy of Marcellus of Ancyra (Angora), vide the conflicting opinions of Bp Lightfoot (<i>Dict. Christ. Biog.</i> ii. 342), and Mr. Ffoulkes (id. iii. 810). Ath. (<i>Apol. contra Ar.</i> §47) says of the Council of Sardica. "The book of our brother Marcellus was also read, by which the frauds of the Eusebians were plainly discovered ...his faith was found to be correct," cf. p. 67, note.</p>
<p><a name="P1548_408314"></a>
<sup>84 </sup>The successor of Eustathius at Beroea, cf. p. 41, note 65. Socrates says the statement that Cyrus accused Eustathius of Sabellianism is an Arian calumny (Soc. i. 24; ii. 9).</p>
<p><a name="P1549_408506"></a>
<sup>85 </sup>Asclepas or Aesculapius was at Tyre (p. 62), and was deposed on the charge of overturning an altar, <font face="SPIonic">wj qusiasthrion anatreyaj</font><font> (Soz. iii. 8).</font></p>

<p><a name="P1551_408823"></a>
<sup>87 </sup>Bishop of Aenos in Thrace, now Enos. (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §19.) Here was shown the tomb of Polydorus. Plin. 4, 11, 18. Virgil (Aen. iii. 18) makes Aeneas call it Aeneadae, but see Conington's note.</p>
<p><a name="P1552_409336"></a>
<sup>88 </sup>Philagrius was praefect of Egypt a.d. 335-340. Ath. (<i>Ep. Encyc.</i>) calls him "a persecutor of the Church and her virgins, an apostate of bad character."</p>
<p><a name="P1557_410269"></a>
<sup>89 </sup><font>The interview took place at Milan, after the Eunuch Eusebius, Chamberlain of Constantius, had in vain tried to win over the bishop at Rome, and had exasperated him by making an improper offering at the shrine of St. Peter. (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> §86.) </font></p>
<p><a name="P1567_412041"></a>
<sup>90 </sup>I adopt the suggestion of Valesius, that <font face="SPIonic">alogwj</font><font> refers not to the condemnation, but to the foolish remark of the imperial chamberlain. Another expedient for clearing Eusebius of the absurdity or saying that Athanasius was condemned at <i>Nicaea,</i> where he triumphed, has been to read <i>Tyre for Nicaea.</i></font></p>
<p><a name="P1570_413358"></a>
<sup>91 </sup>Bishop of Centumcellae (Civita Vecchia); "a bold young fellow, ready for any mischief." A protégé of the Cappadocian Georgius, he was an Arian of the worst type, and had effected the substitution of Felix for Liberius in the Roman see by irregular and scandalous means. (Ath. <i>Hist. Ar.</i> §75.)</p>
<p><a name="P1577_415237"></a>
<sup>92 </sup>A passage of Ammianus Marcellinus (xxi. 16) on the "cursus publicus" has been made famous by Gibbon. "The Christian religion, which in itself is plain and simple, Constantius confounded by the dotage of superstition. Instead of reconciling the parties by the weight of his authority, he cherished and propagated, by verbal disputes, the differences which his vain curiosity had excited. The highways were covered with troops of bishops gallop. ing from every side to the assemblies which they call synods; and while they laboured to reduce the whole sect to their own particular opinions, the public establishment of the posts was almost ruined by their hasty and repeated journeys." Gibbon, chap. xx.</p>
<p><a name="P1581_416429"></a>
<sup>93 </sup>Constantine II. had befriended Athanasius, but the patriarch was neither directly nor indirectly responsible for his attack on Constans and his death. </p>
<p><a name="P1588_418523"></a>
<sup>94 </sup>Eusebia. Constantius II. was thrice married; (i) a.d. 336 (Eus. <i>Vit. Const.</i> iv. 49), to his cousin Constantia, sister of Julian (vid. Pedigree in proleg.); (ii) a.d. 352, to Aurelia Eusebia, an Arian "of exceptional beauty of body and mind" (Amm. Marc. xxi. 6), and (iii) a.d. 360 or 361, to Faustina.</p>
<p><a name="P1589_419255"></a>
<sup>95 </sup>Liberius does not reckon the Arian eunuch as a Christian.</p>
<p><a name="P1593_421537"></a>
<sup>96 </sup>There were originally four factions in the Circus; blue, green, white, and red. Domitian added two more, golden and purple. But the blue and the green absorbed the rest, and divided the multitude at the games. Cf. Juv. XI. 197.</p>
<p>"Totam hodie Romam circus capit, et fragor aurem Percutit, eventum viridis quo colligo panni."</p>
<p>Cf. Amm. Marc. xiv. 6, and Plin. Ep. ix. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P1597_422517"></a>
<sup>97 </sup><font>a.d. 359. </font></p>
<p><a name="P1599_422856"></a>
<sup>98 </sup>The eastern bishops were summoned to Seleucia, in Cilicia; the western to Ariminum, (Rimini). "A previous Conference was held at Sirmium, in order to determine on the creed to be presented to the bipartite Council. ...The Eusebians struggled for the adoption of the Acacian Homoeon, which the Emperor had already both received and abandoned, and they actually effected the adoption of the <i>`like in all things according to the Scriptures,0'</i> a phrase in which the semi-Arians, indeed, included their <i>`like in substance0'</i> or <i>Homoeiision,</i> but which did not necessarily refer to substance or nature at all. Under these circumstances the two Councils met in the autumn of a.d. 359, under the nominal superintendence of the semi-Arians; but, on the Eusebian side, the sharp-witted Acacius undertaking to deal with the disputatious Greeks, the overbearing and cruel Valens with the plainer Latins." (Newman, <i>Arians,</i> iv. §4.) At Seleucia there were 150 bishops; at Ariminum 400.</p>
