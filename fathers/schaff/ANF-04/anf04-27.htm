<p>5 Had pledged Himself, while nether air should bring</p>
<p>The winters in their course, ne'er to decree,</p>
<p>By <i>liquid</i> ruin, retribution's due;</p>
<p>And had assigned, to curb the rains, the bow</p>
<p>Of many hues, sealing the clouds with band</p>
<p>10 Of purple and of green, Iris its name,</p>
<p>The rain-clouds' proper baldric.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2259_629247" id="P2259_629247" name="P2259_629247">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>But alike</p>
<p>With mankind's second race impiety</p>
<p>Revives, and a new age of ill once more</p>
<p>Shoots forth; allotted now no more to <i>showers</i></p>
<p>15 For ruin, but to <i>fires</i>: thus did the land</p>
<p>Of Sodom earn to be by glowing dews</p>
<p>Upburnt, and typically thus portend</p>
<p>The future end.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2268_629537" id="P2268_629537" name="P2268_629537">3</a></sup> There wild voluptuousness</p>

<p>30 Done to man's name and person equally.</p>
<p>But God, forewatching all things, at fix'd time</p>
<p>Doth judge the unjust; with patience tarrying</p>
<p>The hour when crime's ripe age-not any force</p>
<p>Of wrath impetuous-shall have circumscribed</p>

<p>Of vengeance was at hand. Sent from the host</p>
<p>Angelical, two, youths in form, who both</p>
<p>Were ministering spirits,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2291_631065" id="P2291_631065" name="P2291_631065">6</a></sup> carrying</p>
<p>The Lord's divine commissions, come beneath</p>
<p>40 The walls of Sodom. There was dwelling Lot</p>
<p>A transplantation from a pious stock; </p>
<p>Wise, and a practicer of righteousness,</p>
<p>He was the only one to think on God:</p>
<p>As oft a fruitful tree is wont to lurk,</p>
<p>45 Guest-like, in forests wild. He, sitting then</p>
<p>Before the gate (for the celestials scarce</p>
<p>Had reached the ramparts), though he knew not them</p>
<p>Divine,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2302_631707" id="P2302_631707" name="P2302_631707">7</a></sup> accosts them unsolicited,</p>
<p>Invites, and with ancestral honour greets;</p>
<p>50 And offers them, preparing to abide</p>
<p>Abroad, a hospice. By repeated prayers</p>
<p>He wins them; and then ranges studiously</p>
<p>The sacred pledges<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2308_631981" id="P2308_631981" name="P2308_631981">8</a></sup> on his board,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2309_632036" id="P2309_632036" name="P2309_632036">9</a></sup> and quits<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2310_632134" id="P2310_632134" name="P2310_632134">10</a></sup> </p>
<p>His friends with courteous offices. The night</p>
<p>55 Had brought repose: alternate<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2313_632910" id="P2313_632910" name="P2313_632910">11</a></sup> dawn had chased</p>
<p>The night, and Sodom with her shameful law</p>
<p>Makes uproar at the doors. Lot, suppliant wise,</p>
<p>Withstands: "Young men, let not your new fed lust</p>
<p>Enkindle you to violate this youth!<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2318_633166" id="P2318_633166" name="P2318_633166">12</a></sup> </p>
<p>60 Whither is passion's seed inviting you?</p>
<p>To what vain end your lust? For such an end</p>
<p>No creatures wed: not such as haunt the fens;</p>
<p>Not stall-fed cattle; not the gaping brood</p>
<p>Subaqueous; nor they which, modulant</p>
<p>65 On pinions, hang suspended near the clouds;</p>
<p>Nor they which with forth-stretched body creep</p>
<p>Over earth's face. To conjugal delight</p>
<p>Each kind its kind doth owe: but female still</p>
<p>To all is wife; nor is there one that has</p>
<p>70 A mother save a female one. Yet now,</p>
<p>If youthful vigour holds it right<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2331_633728" id="P2331_633728" name="P2331_633728">13</a></sup> to waste</p>
<p>The flower of modesty, I have within</p>
<p>Two daughters of a nuptial age, in whom</p>
<p>Virginity is swelling in its bloom,</p>
<p>75 Already ripe for harvest-a desire</p>
<p>Worthy of men-which let your pleasure reap!</p>
<p>Myself their sire, I yield them; and will pay</p>
<p>For my guests' sake, the forfeit of my grief!"</p>
<p>Answered the mob insane: "And who art thou7</p>
<p>80 And what? and whence? to lord it over us,</p>
<p>And to expound us laws? Shall foreigner</p>
<p>Rule Sodom, and hurl threats? Now, then, thyself</p>
<p>For daughters and for guests shalt sate our greed!</p>
<p>One shall suffice for all!" So said, so done:</p>
<p>85 The frantic mob delays not. As, whene'er</p>
<p>A turbid torrent rolls with wintry tide,</p>
<p>And rushes at one speed through countless streams</p>
<p>Of rivers, if, just where it forks, some tree</p>
<p>Meets the swift waves (not long to stand, save while</p>
<p>90 By her root's force she shall avail to oppose</p>
<p>Her tufty obstacles), when gradually</p>
<p>Her hold upon the undermined soil</p>
<p>Is failing, with her bared stem she hangs,</p>
<p>And, with uncertain heavings to and fro,</p>
<p>95 Defers her certain fall; not otherwise</p>
<p>Lot in the mid-whirl of the dizzy mob</p>
<p>Kept nodding, now almost o'ercome. But power</p>
<p>Divine brings succour: the angelic youths,</p>
<p>Snatching him from the threshold, to his roof</p>
<p>100 Restore him; but upon the spot they mulct</p>
<p>Of sight the mob insane in open day,-</p>
<p>Fit augury of coming penalties!</p>
<p>Then they unlock the just decrees of God:</p>
<p>That penalty condign from heaven will fall</p>
<p>105 On Sodom; that himself had merited</p>
<p>Safety upon the count of righteousness.</p>
<p>"Gird thee, then, up to hasten hence thy flight,</p>
<p>And with thee to lead oat what family</p>
<p>Thou hast: already we are bringing on</p>
<p>110 Destruction o'er the city." Lot with speed</p>
<p>Speaks to his sons-in-law; but their hard heart</p>
<p>Scorned to believe the warning, and at fear</p>
<p>Laughed. At what time the light attempts to climb</p>
<p>The darkness, and heaven's face wears double hue</p>
<p>115 From night and day, the youthful visitants</p>
<p>Were instant to outlead from Sodoma</p>
<p>The race Chaldaean,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2378_635720" id="P2378_635720" name="P2378_635720">14</a></sup> and the righteous house</p>
<p>Consign to safety: "Ho! come, Lot! arise,</p>
<p>And take thy yokefellow and daughters twain,</p>
<p>120 And hence, beyond the boundaries be gone,</p>
<p>Preventing<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2383_635984" id="P2383_635984" name="P2383_635984">15</a></sup> Sodom's penalties!" And eke</p>
<p>With friendly hands they lead them trembling forth,</p>
<p>And then their final mandates give: "Save, Lot,</p>
<p>Thy life, lest thou perchance should will to turn</p>
<p>125 Thy retroverted gaze behind, or stay</p>
<p>The step once taken: to the mountain speed!" </p>
<p>Lot feared to creep the heights with tardy step,</p>
<p>Lest the celestial wrath-fires should o'ertake</p>
<p>And whelm him: therefore he essays to crave</p>
<p>130 Some other ports; a city small, to wit,</p>
<p>Which opposite he had espied."Hereto,"</p>
<p>He said, "I speed my flight: scarce with its walls</p>
<p>'Tis visible; nor is it far, nor great."</p>
<p>They, favouring his prayer, safety assured</p>
<p>135 To him and to the city; whence the spot</p>
<p>Is known in speech barbaric by the name</p>
<p>Segor.<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2400_636766" id="P2400_636766" name="P2400_636766">16</a></sup> Lot enters Segor while the sun</p>
<p>Is rising,<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2402_636851" id="P2402_636851" name="P2402_636851">17</a></sup> the last sun, which glowing bears</p>
<p>To Sodom conflagration; for his rays</p>
<p>140 He had armed all with fire: beneath him spreads</p>
<p>An emulous gloom, which seeks to intercep</p>
<p>The light; and clouds combine to interweave</p>
<p>Their smoky globes with the confused sky:</p>
<p>Down pours a novel shower: the ether seethe</p>
<p>145 With sulphur mixt with blazing flames:<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2410_637294" id="P2410_637294" name="P2410_637294">18</a></sup>   the air</p>
<p>Crackles with liquid heats exust. From hence</p>
<p>The fable has an echo of the truth</p>
<p>Amid its false, that the sun's progeny</p>
<p>Would drive his father's team; but nought availed</p>
<p>150 The giddy boy to curb the haughty steeds</p>
<p>Of fire: so blazed our orb: then lightning reft</p>
<p>The lawless charioteer, and bitter plaint</p>
<p>Transformed his sisters. Let Eridanus</p>
<p>See to it, if one poplar on his banks</p>
<p>155 Whitens, or any bird dons plumage there</p>
<p>Whose note old age makes mellow!<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2422_637949" id="P2422_637949" name="P2422_637949">19</a></sup> </p>
<p><i>Here</i> they mourn</p>
<p>O'er miracles of metamorphosis</p>
<p>Of other sort. For, partner of Lot's flight,</p>
<p>His wife (ah me, for woman! even then<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2427_638656" id="P2427_638656" name="P2427_638656">20</a></sup> </p>
<p>160 Intolerant of law!) alone turned back</p>
<p>At the unearthly murmurs of the sky)</p>
<p>Her daring eyes, but bootlessly: not doomed</p>
<p>To utter what she saw! and then and there</p>
<p>Changed into brittle salt, herself her tomb</p>
<p>165 She stood, herself an image of herself,</p>
<p>Keeping an incorporeal form: and still</p>
<p>In her unsheltered station 'neath the heaven</p>
<p>Dures she, by rains unmelted, by decay</p>
<p>And winds unwasted; nay, if some strange hand</p>
<p>170 Deface her form, forthwith from her own store</p>
<p>Her wounds she doth repair. Still is she said</p>
<p>To live, and, 'mid her corporal change, discharge</p>
<p>With wonted blood her sex's monthly dues.</p>
<p>Gone are the men of Sodom; gone the glare</p>
<p>175 Of their unhallowed ramparts; all the house</p>
<p>Inhospitable, with its lords, is gone:</p>
<p>The champaign is one pyre; here embers rough</p>
<p>And black, here ash-heaps with hoar mould, mark out</p>
<p>The conflagration's course: evanished</p>
<p>180 Is all that old fertility<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2449_639615" id="P2449_639615" name="P2449_639615">21</a></sup>   which Lot,</p>
<p>Seeing outspread before him, ...</p>
<p>No ploughman spends his fruitless toil on glebes</p>
<p>Pitchy with soot: or if some acres there,</p>
<p>But half consumed, still strive to emulate</p>
<p>185 Autumn's glad wealth, pears, peaches, and all fruits</p>
<p>Promise themselves full easely<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2456_641065" id="P2456_641065" name="P2456_641065">22</a></sup> to the eye</p>
<p>In fairest bloom, until the plucker's hand</p>
<p>Is on them: then forthwith the seeming fruit</p>
<p>Crumbles to dust 'neath the bewraying touch,</p>
<p>190 And turns to embers vain.</p>
<p>Thus, therefore (sky</p>
<p>And earth entombed alike), not e'en the sea</p>
<p>Lives there: the quiet of that quiet sea</p>
<p>Is death!<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2465_641419" id="P2465_641419" name="P2465_641419">23</a></sup> -a sea which no wave animates</p>
<p>Through its anhealant volumes; which beneath </p>
<p>195 Its native Auster sighs not anywhere;</p>
<p>Which cannot from its depths one scaly race,</p>
<p>Or with smooth skin or cork-like fence encased,</p>
<p>Produce, or curled shell in single valve</p>
<p>Or double fold enclosed. Bitumen there</p>
