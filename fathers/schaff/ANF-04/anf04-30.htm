<ul><p>After the Evil One's impiety</p>
<p>Profound, and his life-grudging mind, entrapped</p>
<p>Seduced men with empty hope, it laid</p>
<p>Them bare, by impious suasion to false trust</p>
<p>5 In him,-not with impunity, indeed;</p>
<p>For he forthwith, as guilty of the deed,</p>
<p>And author rash of such a wickedness,</p>
<p>Received deserved maledictions. Thus,</p>
<p>Thereafter, maddened, he, most desperate foe,</p>
<p>10 Did more assail and instigate men's minds</p>
<p>In darkness sunk. He taught them to forget</p>
<p>The Lord, and leave sure hope, and idols vain</p>
<p>Follow, and shape themselves a crowd of gods,</p>
<p>Lots, auguries, false names of stars, the show Is</p>
<p>15 Of being able to o'errule the births</p>
<p>Of embryos by inspecting entrails, and</p>
<p>Expecting things to come, by hardihood</p>
<p>Of dreadful magic's renegadoes led,</p>
<p>Wondering at a mass of feigned lore;</p>
<p>20 And he impelled them headlong to spurn life,</p>
<p>Sunk in a criminal insanity;</p>
<p>To joy in blood; to threaten murders fell;</p>
<p>To love the wound, then, in their neighbour's flesh;</p>
<p>Or, burning, and by pleasure's heat entrapped,</p>
<p>25 To transgress nature's covenants, and stain</p>
<p>Pure bodies, manly sex, with an embrace</p>
<p>Unnameable, and uses feminine</p>
<p>Mingled in common contact lawlessly;</p>
<p>Urging embraces chaste, and dedicate</p>
<p>30 To generative duties, to be held</p>
<p>For intercourse obscene for passion's sake.</p>
<p>Such in time past his deeds, assaulting men,</p>
<p>Through the soul's lurking-places, with a flow</p>
<p>Of scorpion-venom,-not that men would blame</p>
<p>35 Him, for they followed of their own accord:</p>
<p>His suasion was in guile; in freedom man</p>
<p>Performed it.</p>

<p>40 Seduced injecting his own counselling</p>
<p>And hoping in his folly (alas!) to find</p>
<p>Forgiveness of his wickedness, unware</p>
<p>What sentence on his deed is waiting him;</p>
<p>With words of wisdom's weaving,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3400_685423" id="P3400_685423" name="P3400_685423">2</a></sup> and a voice</p>

<p>Nakedly to speak evil of the Lord,</p>
<p>Hoping by secret ingenuity</p>
<p>He possibly may lurk unseen. At length</p>
<p>50 The soul's Light<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3408_685771" id="P3408_685771" name="P3408_685771">4</a></sup> as the thrall of flesh is held;</p>
<p>The hope of the despairing, mightier</p>
<p>Than foe, enters the lists; the Fashioner,</p>
<p>The Renovator, of the body He;</p>
<p>True Glory of the Father; Son of God;</p>

<p>Outdriven by His bidding, and own Christ!</p>
<p>All limbs, already rotting, by a word</p>
<p>Are healed; now walks the lame; the deaf forthwith</p>
<p>Hears hope; the maimed extends his hand; the dumb</p>
<p>70 Speaks mighty words: sea at His bidding calms,</p>

<p>80 Extreme, and of perpetual dark, prepared</p>
<p>For himself by the Lord by God's decree</p>
<p>Irrevocable; naked and unarmed,</p>
<p>Damned, vanquisht, doomed to perish in a death</p>
<p>Perennial, guilty now, and sure that he</p>
<p>85 No pardon has, a last impiety</p>
<p>Forthwith he dares,-to scatter everywhere</p>
<p>A word for ears to shudder at, nor meet</p>
<p>For voice to speak. Accosting men cast off</p>
<p>From God's community,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3453_688172" id="P3453_688172" name="P3453_688172">10</a></sup> men wandering</p>

<p>And realms divided: ill's cause is the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3460_688952" id="P3460_688952" name="P3460_688952">12</a></sup> </p>
<p>95 Who built the orb, fashioned breath-quickened flesh,</p>
<p>And gave the law, and by the seers' voice spake.</p>
<p>Him he affirms not <i>good</i>, but owns Him <i>just</i>;</p>
<p>Hard, cruel, taking pleasure fell in war;</p>
<p>In judgment dreadful, pliant to no prayers.</p>
<p>100 His suasion tells of other one, to none</p>
<p>E'er known, who nowhere is, a deity</p>
<p>False, nameless, constituting nought, and who</p>
<p>Hath spoken precepts none. Him he calls <i>good</i>;</p>
<p>Who judges none, but spares all equally,</p>
<p>105 And grudges life to none. No judgment waits</p>
<p>The guilty; so he says, bearing about</p>
<p>A gory poison with sweet honey mixt</p>
<p>For wretched men. That flesh can rise-to which</p>
<p>Himself was cause of ruin, which he spoiled</p>
<p>110 Iniquitously with contempt (whence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3477_689763" id="P3477_689763" name="P3477_689763">13</a></sup> cursed,</p>
<p>He hath grief without end), its ever-foe,-</p>
<p>He doth deny; because with various wound</p>
<p>Life to expel and the salvation whence</p>
<p>He fell he strives: and therefore says that Christ</p>
<p>115 Came suddenly to earth,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3483_689997" id="P3483_689997" name="P3483_689997">14</a></sup> but was not made,</p>
<p>By any compact, partner of the flesh;</p>
<p>But Spirit-form, and body feigned beneath</p>
<p>A shape imaginary, seeks to mock</p>
<p>Men with a semblance that what is not is.</p>
<p>120 Does this, then, become God, to sport with men</p>
<p>By darkness led? to act an impious lie?</p>
<p>Or falsely call Himself a man? He walks,</p>
<p>Is carried, clothed, takes due rest, handled is,</p>
<p>Suffers, is hung and buried: man's are all</p>
<p>125 Deeds which, in holy body conversant,</p>
<p>But sent by God the Father, who hath all</p>
<p>Created, He did perfect properly,</p>
<p>Reclaiming not another's but His own;</p>
<p>Discernible to peoples who of old</p>
<p>130 Were hoping for Him by His very work,</p>
<p>And through the prophets' voice to the round world<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3500_690923" id="P3500_690923" name="P3500_690923">15</a></sup> </p>

<p>Wandering in death's threshold manifest,</p>
<p>And leave behind the known. False is their faith,</p>
<p>135 False is their God, deceptive their reward,</p>
<p>False is their resurrection, death's defeat</p>
<p>False, vain their martyrdoms, and e'en Christ's name</p>
<p>An empty sound: whom, teaching that He came</p>
<p>Like magic mist, they (quite demented) own</p>
<p>140 To be the actor of a lie, and make</p>
<p>His passion bootless, and the populace<sup><a href="footnote/fn35.htm#P3511_691373" id="P3511_691373" name="P3511_691373">16</a></sup> </p>

<p>Are <i>such</i> the honours rendered to the Lord?</p>
<p>Ah! wretched men! gratuitously lost</p>

<p>To call themselves "Virtue Supreme; "and feign</p>

<p>Held ever: to its wounds he care applies;</p>
<p>130 And pours forth tears; and nutriments of food</p>
<p>Takes, through its limbs, often and eagerly:</p>
<p>This hopes he to have ever with himself</p>
<p>Immortal; o'er its fracture doth he groan;</p>
<p>And grieves to quit it limb by limb: fixt time</p>
<p>135 Death lords it o'er the unhappy flesh; that so</p>
<p>From light dust it may be renewed, and death</p>
<p>Unfriendly fail at length, when flesh, released,</p>
<p>Rises again. This will that victory be</p>
<p>Supreme and long expected, wrought by Him,</p>
<p>140 The aye-to-be-revered, who did become </p>
<p>True man; and by His Father's virtue won: Who</p>
<p>man's redeemed limbs unto the heavens</p>
<p>Hath raised,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5217_784038" id="P5217_784038" name="P5217_784038">307</a></sup> and richly opened access up</p>
<p>Thither in hope, first to His nation; then</p>
<p>145 To those among all tongues in whom His work</p>
<p>Is ever doing: Minister imbued</p>
<p>With His Sire's parent-care, seen by the eye</p>
<p>Of the Illimitable, He performed,</p>
<p>By suffering, His missions.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5224_784321" id="P5224_784321" name="P5224_784321">308</a></sup> </p>
<p>What say now</p>
<p>150 The impious voices? what th' abandoned crew?</p>
<p>If He Himself, God the Creator's self,</p>
<p>Gave not the Law,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5229_784565" id="P5229_784565" name="P5229_784565">309</a></sup> He who from Egypt's vale<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5230_784625" id="P5230_784625" name="P5230_784625">310</a></sup> </p>
<p>Paved in the waves a path, and freely gave</p>
<p>The seats which He had said of old, why comes</p>
<p>155 He in that very People and that land</p>
<p>Aforesaid? and why rather sought He not</p>
<p>Some other<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5236_784837" id="P5236_784837" name="P5236_784837">311</a></sup> peoples or some rival<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5237_784873" id="P5237_784873" name="P5237_784873">312</a></sup> realms?</p>
<p>Why, further, did He teach that, through the seers,</p>
<p> (With Name foretold in full, yet not His own,)</p>
<p>160 He had been often sung of? Whence, again,</p>
<p>Could He have issued baptism's kindly gifts,</p>
<p>Promised by some one else, as His own works?</p>
<p>These gifts men who God's mandates had transgressed,</p>
<p>And hence were found polluted, longed for,</p>
<p>165 And begged a pardoning rescue from fierce death.</p>
<p>Expected long, they<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5247_785292" id="P5247_785292" name="P5247_785292">313</a></sup> came: but that to those</p>
<p>Who recognised them when erst heard, and now</p>
<p>Have recognised them, when in due time found,</p>
<p>Christ's true hand is to give them, this, with voice</p>
<p>170 Paternal, the Creator-Sire Himself</p>

<p>And thus the work of virtue which He framed,</p>
<p>And still frames, arms, and fosters, and doth now</p>

<p>At least terrestrial reason.</p>
<p>When the Lord</p>
<p>Christ came to be, as flesh, born into the orb</p>
<p>In time of king Augustus' reign at Rome,</p>
<p>First, by decree, the nations numbered are</p>
<p>190 By census everywhere: this measure, then,</p>
<p>This same king chanced to pass, because the Will</p>
<p>Supreme, in whose high reigning hand doth lie</p>
<p>The king's heart, had impelled him:<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5282_787530" id="P5282_787530" name="P5282_787530">320</a></sup>   he was first</p>
<p>To do it, and the enrolment was reduced</p>
<p>195 To orderly arrangement. Joseph then</p>
<p>Likewise, with his but just delivered wife</p>
<p>Mary,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5287_788009" id="P5287_788009" name="P5287_788009">321</a></sup> with her celestial Son alike,</p>
<p>Themselves withal are numbered. Let, then, such</p>
<p>As trust to instruments of human skill,</p>
<p>200 Who may (approving of applying them</p>
<p>As attestators of the holy word)</p>
<p>Inquire into this census, if it be</p>
<p>But found so as we say, then afterwards</p>
<p>Repent they and seek pardon while time still</p>

<p>A grave crime, while in our disparagement</p>
<p>They glow, and do resist us, neither call</p>
<p>Christ's family unknown, nor can<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5302_788847" id="P5302_788847" name="P5302_788847">324</a></sup> affirm</p>
<p>They hanged a man, who spake truth, on a tree:<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5304_788955" id="P5304_788955" name="P5304_788955">325</a></sup> </p>

<p>They keep a reticence, so partially</p>
<p>They triumph; for they strive to represent</p>
<p>God to the peoples commonly as man.</p>
<p>215 Behold the error which o'ercomes you both!<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5312_789485" id="P5312_789485" name="P5312_789485">327</a></sup> </p>
<p>This error will our cause assist, the while,</p>
<p>We prove to you those things which certain are.</p>
<p>They do deny Him God; you falsely call</p>

<p>Sinks you; which him who hath presumed to hint</p>
<p>You both do, sinking, sprinkle:<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5320_789804" id="P5320_789804" name="P5320_789804">328</a></sup> for His deeds</p>

<p>Commingled, and the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5323_790251" id="P5323_790251" name="P5323_790251">329</a></sup> will furnish signs</p>

<p>Each one hath seized he keeps; in murky gloom,</p>
<p>235 As God from fleshly body silently</p>
<p>Outbreathes His soul, in darkness trembling day</p>
<p>Took refuge with the sun; twice dawned one day;</p>
<p>Its centre black night covered: from their base</p>
<p>Mounts move in circle, wholly moved was earth,</p>
<p>240 Saints'sepulchres stood ope, and all things Joined</p>
<p>In fear to see His passion whom they knew!</p>
<p>His lifeless side a soldier with bare spear</p>
<p>Pierces, and forth flows blood, nor water less</p>
<p>Thence followed. These facts they<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5351_791649" id="P5351_791649" name="P5351_791649">336</a></sup> agree to hide,</p>
