<sup>43 </sup>Or, "there." The question is, whether a different tree is meant, or the rose just spoken of.</p>
<p><a name="P3113_672909"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>This seems to be <i>marshmallows.</i></p>
<p><a name="P3117_673049"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>Here again it is plain that the writer is drawing his description from what we read of the garden of Eden.</p>
<p><a name="P3131_673711"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>"Salus," health (probably) in its widest sense, both bodily and mental; or perhaps "safety," "salvation."</p>
<p><a name="P3139_674092"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>Reliquam vitam, i.e., apparently his life in all other relations; unless it mean his life <i>after his parents' death</i>, which seems less likely. </p>
<p><a name="P3160_675066"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>i.e., "appeals to." So Burke: "I <i>attest</i> the former, I <i>attest</i> the coming generations." This "attesting of its acts" seems to refer to Matt. xxv. 44. It appeals to them in hope of mitigating its doom.</p>
<p><a name="P3164_675416"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>This seems to be the sense. The Latin stands thus: "Flammas pro meritis, stagnantia tela tremiscunt."</p>
<p><a name="P3187_676457"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>Or, "banished."</p>
<p><a name="P3196_676796"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>I adopt the correction (suggested in Migne) of just<i>is</i> for just<i>as</i>. </p>
<p><a name="P3198_676898"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>This is an extraordinary use for the Latin dative; and even if the meaning be "<i>for</i> (i.e., to suffer) penalty eternal," it is scarcely less so.</p>
