<sup>1 </sup>[Sallust, <i>Catiline</i>, "Idem facere atque sentire," etc. Also, Catiline's speech, p. 6 of <i>The Conspiracy</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P5535_810208"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>[Beautiful tribute to Christian friendship, in a primitive example. We must bear in mind that the story is of an earlier period than that of the work itself, written at Cirta.] </p>
<p><a name="P5545_816445"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>"Ita ut me ex tribus medium lateris ambitione protegerent." </p>
<p><a name="P5549_818084"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The ms. and first edition read "more;" Ursinus suggested <i>minus</i> instead of <i>magis</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P5550_818413"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>This clause is otherwise read: "Therefore we must be indignant, nay, must be grieved."</p>
<p><a name="P5551_818605"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Otherwise for "even," "except."</p>
<p><a name="P5552_819083"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>The reading of the ms. is "stuprari," as above. "Scrutari," "sciari," or "lustrare" and "suspicari," are proposed emendations.</p>
<p><a name="P5553_820230"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Or, "although its weight may have established the earth."</p>

<p><a name="P5555_820550"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>Variously read, "is raised up," or "and is raised up." The ms. has "attollitur," which by some is amended into "et alitur," or "et tollitur."</p>
<p><a name="P5556_821530"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>Either "delectu" or "dilectu."</p>

<p><a name="P5563_824200"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Or, "the great mother" [i.e., Cybele. S.].</p>
<p><a name="P5564_824897"></a>

<sup>19 </sup>Otherwise, "who breathless with horses foaming," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P5571_827093"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>Otherwise, "the offence of Jupiter, the renewal of the games," etc. </p>
<p><a name="P5575_829651"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>According to the codex, "the Milesian." [See note in Reeve's <i>Apologies of Justin Martyr, Tertullian</i>, and <i>Minucius Felix</i>, vol. ii. p. 59. S.]</p>
<p><a name="P5576_830238"></a>
<sup>22 </sup>Some have corrected this word, reading "without consideration," <i>scil</i>. "inconsulte;" and the four first editions omit the subsequent words, "concerning the divinity."</p>
<p><a name="P5577_831606"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>There are various emendations of this passage, but their meaning is somewhat obscure. One is elaborately ingenious: "Ita illis pavorum fallax spes solatio redivivo blanditur," which is said to imply, "Thus the hope that deceives their fears, soothes them with the hope of living again."</p>
<p><a name="P5581_833047"></a>
<sup>24 </sup>Otherwise read "abominable."</p>
<p><a name="P5582_833402"></a>
<sup>25 </sup>This charge, as Oehler thinks, refers apparently to the kneeling posture in which penitents made confession before their bishop. </p>
<p><a name="P5583_834511"></a>
<sup>26 </sup>This calumny seems to have originated from the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
<p><a name="P5584_834760"></a>
<sup>27 </sup><i>Scil</i>. Fronto of Cirta, spoken of again in ch. xxxi. [A recent very interesting discovery goes to show that our author was the chief magistrate of Cirta, in Algeria, from a.d. 210 to 217. See Schaff, vol. iii. p. 841.]</p>

<sup>28 </sup>Otherwise, "no consecrated images."</p>
<p><a name="P5589_838228"></a>
<sup>29 </sup>Otherwise, "we are contained and bound together."</p>
<p><a name="P5590_838304"></a>
<sup>30 </sup>[These very accusations, reduced back to Christian language, show that much of the Creed was, in fact, known to the heathen at this period.]</p>

<sup>31 </sup>[1 Tim. iv. 7.] </p>
<p><a name="P5595_840116"></a>
