<p>Of quadrupeds; and mandate gave that all</p>
<p>Should grow with multiplying seed, and roam</p>
<p>30 And feed in earth's immensity. All these</p>
<p>When power divine by mere command arranged,</p>
<p>Observing that things mundane still would lack</p>

<p>To shape him with His sacred own right hand,</p>
<p>Inspiring his dull breast from breast divine.</p>
<p>40 Whom when He saw formed in a likeness such</p>
<p>As is His own, He measures how he broods</p>
<p>Alone on gnawing cares. Straight way his eyes</p>
<p>With sleep irriguous He doth perfuse;</p>
<p>That from his left rib woman softlier</p>
<p>45 May formed be, and that by mixture twin</p>
<p>His substance may add firmness to her limbs.</p>
<p>To her the name of "Life"-which is called "Eve"<sup><a href="footnote/fn25.htm#P2576_646333" id="P2576_646333" name="P2576_646333">16</a></sup> -</p>

<p>50 Cleave to their wives.</p>
<p>The seventh came, when God</p>
<p>At His works' end did rest, decreeing it</p>
<p>Sacred unto the coming ages' joys.</p>
<p>Straightway-the crowds of living things deployed</p>
<p>Before him-Adam's cunning skill (the gift</p>
<p>55 Of the good Lord) gives severally to all</p>
<p>The name which still is permanent. Himself,</p>

<p>65 These joys among, a tree with deadly fruits,</p>
<p>Breeding, conjoined, the taste of life and death,</p>
<p>Arises. In the midst of the demesne<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2601_647479" id="P2601_647479" name="P2601_647479">20</a></sup> </p>

<p>Swells, and with hoarse tide wears<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2607_647721" id="P2607_647721" name="P2607_647721">21</a></sup> conspicuous gems,</p>

<p>By name; and raves, transparent in its shoals,</p>
<p>75 The margin of the land of Havilath.</p>
<p>Next Gihon, gliding by the Aethiops,</p>
<p>Enriches them. The Tigris is the third,</p>
<p>Adjoined to fair Euphrates, furrowing</p>
<p>Disjunctively with rapid flood the land</p>
<p>80 Of Asshur. Adam, with his faithful wife,</p>
<p>Placed here as guard and workman, is informed</p>
<p>By such the Thunderer's<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2620_648281" id="P2620_648281" name="P2620_648281">24</a></sup> speech: "Tremble ye not</p>
<p>To pluck together the permitted fruits</p>
<p>Which, with its leafy bough, the unshorn grove</p>
<p>85 Hath furnished; anxious only lest perchance</p>
<p>Ye cull the hurtful apple,<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2625_648533" id="P2625_648533" name="P2625_648533">25</a></sup> which is green</p>
<p>With a twin juice for functions several."</p>
<p>And, no less blind meantime than Night herself,</p>
<p>Deep night 'gan hold them, nor had e'en a robe</p>
<p>90 Covered their new-formed limbs.</p>
<p>Amid these haunts,</p>
<p>And on mild berries reared, a foamy snake,</p>
<p>Surpassing living things in sense astute,</p>
<p>Was creeping silently with chilly coils.</p>
<p>He, brooding over envious lies instinct</p>
<p>95 With gnawing sense, tempts the soft heart beneath</p>
<p>The woman's breast: "Tell me, why shouldst thou dread</p>
<p>The apple's<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2638_649024" id="P2638_649024" name="P2638_649024">26</a></sup> happy seeds? Why, hath not</p>
<p>All known fruits hallowed?<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2640_649088" id="P2640_649088" name="P2640_649088">27</a></sup> Whence if thou be prompt</p>
<p>To cull the honeyed fruits, the golden world<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2642_649207" id="P2642_649207" name="P2642_649207">28</a></sup> </p>
<p>100 Will on its starry pole return."<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2644_649257" id="P2644_649257" name="P2644_649257">29</a></sup> </p>
<p>But she Refuses, and the boughs forbidden fears</p>
<p>To touch. But yet her breast 'gins be o'er come </p>
<p>With sense infirm. Straightway, as she at length</p>
<p>With snowy tooth the dainty morsels bit,</p>
<p>105 Stained with no cloud the sky serene up-lit!</p>
<p>Then taste, instilling lure in honeyed jaws,</p>
<p>To her yet uninitiated lord</p>
<p>Constrained her to present the gift; which he</p>
<p>No sooner took, then-night effaced!:-their eyes</p>
<p>110 Shone out serene in the resplendent world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2655_649881" id="P2655_649881" name="P2655_649881">30</a></sup> </p>
<p>When, then, they each their body bare espied,</p>
<p>And when their shameful parts they see, with leaves</p>
<p>Of fig they shadow them. By chance, beneath</p>
<p>The sun's now setting light, they recognise</p>
<p>115 The sound of the Lord's voice, and, trembling, haste</p>
<p>To bypaths. Then the Lord of heaven accosts</p>
<p>The mournful Adam: "Say, where now thou art."</p>
<p>Who suppliant thus answers: "Thine address,</p>
<p>O Lord, O Mighty One, I tremble at,</p>
<p>120 Beneath my fearful heart; and, being bare,</p>
<p>I faint with chilly dread." Then said the</p>
<p>Lord:</p>
<p>"Who hath the hurtful fruits, then, given you? "</p>
<p>"This woman, while she tells me how her eyes</p>
<p>With brilliant day promptly perfused were,</p>
<p>125 And on her dawned the liquid sky serene,</p>
<p>And heaven's sun and stars, o'ergave them me!"</p>
<p>Forthwith God's anger frights perturbed Eve,</p>
<p>While the Most High inquires the authorship</p>
<p>Of the forbidden act. Hereon she opes</p>
<p>130 Her tale: "The speaking serpent's suasive words</p>
<p>I harboured, while the guile and bland request</p>
<p>Misled me: for, with venoms viperous</p>
<p>His words inweaving, stories told he me</p>
<p>Of those delights which should all fruits excel."</p>
<p>135 Straightway the Omnipotent the dragon's deeds</p>
<p>Condemns, and bids him be to all a sight</p>
<p>Unsightly, monstrous; bids him presently</p>
<p>With grovelling beast to crawl; and then to bite</p>
<p>And chew the soil; while war should to all time</p>
<p>140 'Twixt human senses and his tottering self</p>
<p>Be waged, that he might creep, crestfallen, prone,</p>
<p>Behind the legs of men,<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2689_651302" id="P2689_651302" name="P2689_651302">31</a></sup> -that while he glides</p>
<p>Close on their heels they may down-trample him.</p>
<p>The woman, sadly caught by guileful words,</p>
<p>145 Is bidden yield her fruit with struggle hard,</p>
<p>And bear her husband's yoke with patient zeal.<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2694_651522" id="P2694_651522" name="P2694_651522">32</a></sup> </p>
<p>"But thou, to whom the sentence<sup><a href="footnote/fn26.htm#P2696_651663" id="P2696_651663" name="P2696_651663">33</a></sup> of the wife</p>
<p> (Who, vanquished, to the dragon pitiless</p>
<p>Yielded) seemed true, shalt through long times deplore</p>
<p>150 Thy labour sad; for thou shalt see, instead</p>
<p>Of wheaten harvest's seed, the thistle rise,</p>
<p>And the thorn plenteously with pointed spines:</p>
<p>So that, with weary heart and mournful breast,</p>
<p>Full many sighs shall furnish anxious food;<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2704_652073" id="P2704_652073" name="P2704_652073">34</a></sup> </p>
<p>155 Till, in the setting hour of coming death,</p>
<p>To level earth, whence thou thy body draw'st,</p>
<p>Thou be restored." This done, the Lord bestows</p>
<p>Upon the trembling pair a tedious life;</p>
<p>And from the sacred gardens far removes</p>
<p>160 Them downcast, and locates them opposite,</p>
<p>And from the threshold bars them by mid fire,</p>
<p>Wherein from out the swift heat is evolved</p>
<p>A cherubim,<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2714_652531" id="P2714_652531" name="P2714_652531">35</a></sup> while fierce the hot point glows,</p>
<p>And rolls enfolding flames. And lest their limbs</p>
<p>165 With sluggish cold should be benumbed, the Lord</p>
<p>Hides flayed from cattle's flesh together sews,</p>
<p>With vestures warm their bare limbs covering.</p>
<p>When, therefore, Adam-now believing-felt</p>
<p> (By wedlock taught) his manhood, he confers</p>
<p>170 On his loved wife the mother's name; and, made</p>
<p>Successively by scions twain a sire,</p>
<p>Gives names to stocks<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2724_653204" id="P2724_653204" name="P2724_653204">36</a></sup> diverse: Cam the first</p>
<p>Hath for his name, to whom is Abel joined.</p>
<p>The latter's care tended the harmless sheep;</p>
<p>175 The other turned the earth with curved plough. </p>
<p>These, when in course of time<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2729_653512" id="P2729_653512" name="P2729_653512">37</a></sup> they brought their gifts</p>
<p>To Him who thunders, offered-as their sense</p>
<p>Prompted them-fruits unlike. The elder one</p>
<p>Offered the first-fruits<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2733_653728" id="P2733_653728" name="P2733_653728">38</a></sup> of the fertile glebes:</p>
<p>180 The other pays his vows with gentle lamb,</p>
<p>Bearing in hand the entrails pure, and fat</p>
<p>Snow-white; and to the Lord, who pious vows</p>
<p>Beholds, is instantly acceptable.</p>
<p>Wherefore with anger cold did Cain glow;<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2739_654082" id="P2739_654082" name="P2739_654082">39</a></sup> </p>
<p>185 With whom God deigns to talk, and thus begins:</p>
<p>"Tell Me, if thou live rightly, and discern</p>
<p>Things hurtful, couldst thou not then pass shine age</p>
<p>Pure from contracted guilt? Cease to essay</p>
<p>With gnawing sense thy brother's ruin, who,</p>
<p>190 Subject to thee as lord, his neck shall yield."</p>
<p>Not e'en thus softened, he unto the fields</p>
<p>Conducts his brother; whom when overta'en</p>
<p>In lonely mead he saw, with his twin palms</p>
<p>Bruising his pious throat, he crushed life out.</p>
<p>195 Which deed the Lord espying from high heaven,</p>
<p>Straitly demands "where Abel is on earth? "</p>
<p>He says "he will not as his brother's guard</p>
<p>Be set." Then God outspeaks to him again:</p>
<p>"Doth not the sound of his blood's voice, sent up</p>
<p>200 To Me, ascend unto heaven's lofty pole?</p>
<p>Learn, therefore, for so great a crime what doom</p>
<p>Shall wait thee. Earth, which with thy kinsman's blood</p>
<p>Hath reeked but now, shall to thy hateful hand</p>
<p>Refuse to render back the cursed seeds</p>
<p>205 Entrusted her; nor shall, if set with herbs,</p>
<p>Produce her fruit: that, torpid, thou shalt dash</p>
</ul></ul><p>Thy limbs against each other with much fear."....</p>
