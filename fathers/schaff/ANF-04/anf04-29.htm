<p>One fruit illicit, whence he was to know</p>
<p>Forthwith how to discriminate alike</p>
<p>Evil and equity, God him forbade</p>
<p>80 To touch. What functions of the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2866_660472" id="P2866_660472" name="P2866_660472">20</a></sup> did God</p>
<p>Permit to man, and sealed the sweet sweet pledge</p>
<p>Of His own love! and jurisdiction gave</p>
<p>O'er birds, and granted him both deep and soil</p>
<p>To tame, and mandates useful did impart</p>
<p>85 Of dear salvation!'Neath his sway He gave</p>
<p>The lands, the souls of flying things, the race</p>
<p>Feathered, and every race, or tame or wild,</p>
<p>Of beasts, and the sea's race, and monsterforms</p>
<p>Shapeless of swimming things. But since so soon</p>
<p>90 The primal man by primal crime transgressed</p>
<p>The law, and left the mandates of the Lord</p>
<p> (Led by a wife who counselled all the ills),</p>
<p>By death he 'gan to perish. Woman 'twas</p>
<p>Who sin's first ill committed, and (the law</p>
<p>95 Transgressed) deceived her husband. Eve, induced</p>
<p>By guile, the thresholds oped to death, and proved</p>
<p>To her own self, with her whole race as well,</p>
<p>A procreatrix of funereal woes.</p>
<p>Hence unanticipated wickedness,</p>
<p>100 Hence death, like seed, for aye, is scattered. Then</p>
<p>More frequent grew atrocious deed; and toil</p>
<p>More savage set the corrupt orb astir:</p>
<p> (This lure the crafty serpent spread, inspired</p>
<p>By envy's self:) then peoples more invent</p>
<p>105 Practices of ill deeds; and by ill deeds</p>
<p>Gave birth to seeds of wickedness.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>The only Lord. whose is the power supreme. </p>
<p>Who o'er the heights the summits holds of heaven</p>
<p>Supreme, and in exalted regions dwells</p>
<p>110 In lofty light for ages, mindful too</p>
<p>Of present time, and of futurity</p>
<p>Prescient beforehand, keeps the progeny</p>
<p>Of ill-desert, and all the souls which move</p>
<p>By reason's force much-erring manf-nor less</p>
<p>115 Their tardy bodies governs He-against</p>
<p>The age decreed, so soon as, stretched in death,</p>
<p>Men lay aside their ponderous limbs, and light</p>
<p>As air, shall go, their earthly bonds undone,</p>
<p>And take in diverse parts their proper spheres</p>
<p>120 (But some He bids be forthwith by glad gales</p>
<p>Recalled to life, and be in secret kept</p>
<p>To wait the decreed law's awards, until</p>
<p>Their bodies with resuscitated limbs</p>
<p>Revive.<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2912_662351" id="P2912_662351" name="P2912_662351">21</a></sup> ) Then shall men 'gin to weigh the awards</p>
<p>125 Of their first life, and on their crime and faults</p>
<p>To think, and keep them for their penalties</p>
<p>Which will be far from death; and mindful grow</p>
<p>Of pious duties, by God's judgments taught;</p>
<p>To wait expectant for their penalty</p>
<p>130 And their descendants', fruit of their own crime;</p>
<p>Or else to live wholly the life of sheep,<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2920_663320" id="P2920_663320" name="P2920_663320">22</a></sup> </p>
<p>Without a name; and in God's ear, now deaf,</p>
<p>Pour unavailing weeping. Shall not God</p>
<p>Almighty, 'neath whose law are all things ruled,</p>
<p>135 Be able after death life to restore?</p>
<p>Or is there ought which the creation's Lord</p>
<p>Unable seems to do? If, darkness chased,</p>
<p>He could outstretch the light, and could compound</p>
<p>All the world's mass by a word suddenly,</p>
<p>140 And raise by potent voice all things from <i>nought</i>,</p>
<p>Why out of <i>somewhat</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2931_663778" id="P2931_663778" name="P2931_663778">23</a></sup> could He not compound</p>
<p>The well-known shape which erst had been, which He</p>
<p>Had moulded formerly; and bid the form</p>
<p>Arise assimilated to Himself</p>
<p>145 Again? Since God's are all things, earth the more</p>
<p>Gives Him all back; for she will, when He bids,</p>
<p>Unweave whate'er she woven had before.</p>
<p>If one, perhaps, laid on sepulchral pyre,</p>
<p>The flame consumed; or one in its blind waves</p>
<p>150 The ocean have dismembered; if of one</p>
<p>The entrails have, in hunger, satisfied</p>
<p>The fishes; or on any's limbs wild beasts</p>
<p>Have fastened cruel death; or any's blood,</p>
<p>His body reft by birds, unhid have lain:</p>
<p>155 Yet shall they not wrest from the mighty Lord</p>
<p>His latest dues. Need is that men appear</p>
<p>Quickened from death 'fore God, and at His bar</p>
<p>Stand in their shapes resumed. Thus arid seeds</p>
<p>Are drops into the vacant lands, and deep</p>
<p>160 In the fixt furrows die and rot: and hence</p>
<p>Is not their surface<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2952_664679" id="P2952_664679" name="P2952_664679">24</a></sup> animated soon</p>
<p>With stalks repaired? and do they<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2954_664774" id="P2954_664774" name="P2954_664774">25</a></sup> not grow strong</p>

<p>165 In mass? The stars all set, and, born again,</p>
<p>Renew their sheen; and day dies with its light</p>
<p>Lost in dense night; and now night wanes herself</p>
<p>As light unveils creation presently;</p>
<p>And now another and another day</p>
<p>170 Rises from its own stars; and the sun sets,</p>
<p>Bright as it is with splendour-bearing light;</p>
<p>Light perishes when by the coming eve</p>
<p>The world<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2967_665336" id="P2967_665336" name="P2967_665336">27</a></sup> is shaded; and the phoenix lives</p>
<p>By her own soot<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2969_665396" id="P2969_665396" name="P2969_665396">28</a></sup> renewed, and presently</p>
<p>175 Rises, again a bird, O wondrous sight!</p>
<p>After her burnings! The bare tree in time</p>
<p>Shoots with her leaves; and once more are her boughs</p>
<p>Curved by the germen of the fruits. While then</p>

<p>With its own lustre clad, another clothes;</p>
<p>265 And here with many a seed the dewy fields</p>
<p>Are dappled, and the snowy tilths are crisped</p>
<p>With rosy flowers. No region happier</p>
<p>Is known in other spots; none which in look</p>
<p>Is fairer, or in honour more excels.</p>
<p>270 Never in flowery gardens are there born</p>
<p>Such lilies, nor do such upon our plains</p>
<p>Outbloom; nor does the rose so blush, what time,</p>
<p>New-born, 'tis opened by the breeze; nor is</p>
<p>The purple with such hue by Tyrian dye</p>
<p>275 Imbued. With coloured pebbles beauteous gleams</p>
<p>The gem: here shines the prasinus;<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3085_671620" id="P3085_671620" name="P3085_671620">42</a></sup> there glows</p>
<p>The carbuncle; and giant-emerald</p>
<p>Is green with grassy light. Here too are born</p>
<p>The cinnamons, with odoriferous twigs;</p>
<p>280 And with dense leaf gladsome amomum Joins</p>
<p>Its fragrance. Here, a native, lies the gold</p>
<p>Of radiant sheen; and lofty groves reach heaven</p>
<p>In blooming time, and germens fruitfullest</p>
<p>Burden the living boughs. No glades like these</p>
<p>285 Hath Ind herself forth-stretcht; no tops so dense</p>
<p>Rears on her mount the pine; nor with a shade</p>
<p>So lofty-leaved is her cypress crisped;</p>
<p>Nor better in its season blooms her bough</p>
<p>In spring-tide. Here black firs on lofty peak</p>
<p>290 Bloom; and the only woods that know no hail</p>
<p>Are green eternally: no foliage falls;</p>
<p>At no time fails the flower. There, too, there blooms</p>
<p>A flower as red as Tarsine purple is:</p>
<p>A rose, I ween, it is (red hue it has,</p>
<p>295 An odour keen); such aspect on its leaves</p>
<p>It wears, such odour breathes. A tree it<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3106_672520" id="P3106_672520" name="P3106_672520">43</a></sup> stands,</p>
<p>With a new flower, fairest in fruits; a crop</p>
<p>Life-giving, dense, its happy strength does yield.</p>
<p>Rich honies with green cane their fragrance Join,</p>
<p>300 And milk flows potable in runners full;</p>
<p>And with whate'er that sacred earth is green,</p>
<p>It all breathes life; and there Crete's healing gift<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3113_672909" id="P3113_672909" name="P3113_672909">44</a></sup> </p>
<p>Is sweetly redolent. tide,</p>
<p>Flows in the placid plains a fount: four floods</p>
<p>305 Thence water parted lands.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3117_673049" id="P3117_673049" name="P3117_673049">45</a></sup> The garden robed</p>
<p>With flowers, I wot, keeps ever spring; no cold</p>
<p>Of wintry star varies the breeze; and earth,</p>
<p>After her birth-throes, with a kindlier blast</p>
<p>Repairs. Night there is none; the stars maintain</p>
<p>310 Their darkness; angers, envies, and dire greed</p>
<p>Are absent; and out-shut is fear, and cares</p>
<p>Driven from the threshold. Here the Evil One</p>
<p>Is homeless; he is into worthy courts</p>
<p>Out-gone, nor is't e'er granted him to touch</p>
<p>315 The glades forbidden. But here ancient faith</p>
<p>Rests in elect abode; and life here treads,</p>
<p>Joying in an eternal covenant;</p>
<p>And health<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3131_673711" id="P3131_673711" name="P3131_673711">46</a></sup> without a care is gladsome here</p>
<p>In placid tilths, ever to live and be</p>
<p>320 Ever in light.</p>

<p>Pious, and cultivant of equity</p>
<p>And goodness; who hath feared the thundering God</p>
<p>With mind sincere; with sacred duteousness</p>
<p>Tended his parents; and his other life<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3139_674092" id="P3139_674092" name="P3139_674092">47</a></sup> </p>

<p>With faithful help a friend in indigence;</p>

<p>Exhorting, raise their voices to the stars;</p>
<p>Thanksgivings to the Lord in joyous wise</p>
<p>They psalming celebrate; and they shall go </p>
<p>Their harmless way with comrade messengers.</p>
<p>340 When ended hath the Lord these happy gifts,</p>
<p>And likewise sent away to realms eterne</p>
<p>The just, then comes a pitiable crowd</p>
<p>Wailing its crimes; with parching tears it pours</p>
<p>All groans effusely, and attests<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3160_675066" id="P3160_675066" name="P3160_675066">48</a></sup> in acts</p>
<p>345 With frequent ululations. At the sight</p>
<p>Of flames, their merit's due, and stagnant pools</p>
<p>Of fire, wrath's weapons, they 'gin tremble all.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3164_675416" id="P3164_675416" name="P3164_675416">49</a></sup> </p>
<p>Them an angelic host, upsnatching them,</p>
<p>Forbids to pray, forbids to pour their cries</p>
<p>350 (Too late!) with clamour loud: pardon withheld,</p>
<p>Into the lowest bottom they are hurled!</p>
<p>O miserable men! how oft to you</p>
<p>Hath Majesty divine made itself known!</p>
<p>The sounds of heaven ye have heard; have seen</p>
<p>355 Its lightnings; have experienced its rains</p>
<p>Assiduous; its ires of winds and hail!</p>
<p>How often nights and days serene do make</p>
<p>Your seasons-God's gifts-fruitful with fair yields!</p>
<p>Roses were vernal; the grain's summer-tide</p>
<p>360 Failed not; the autumn variously poured</p>
<p>Its mellow fruits; the rugged winter brake</p>
<p>The olives, icy though they were: 'twas God</p>
<p>Who granted all, nor did His goodness fail.</p>
<p>At God earth trembled; on His voice the deep</p>
<p>365 Hung, and the rivers trembling fled and left</p>
<p>Sands dry; and every creature everywhere</p>
<p>Confesses God! Ye (miserable men!)</p>
<p>Have heaven's Lord and earth's denied; and oft</p>
<p> (Horrible!) have God's heralds put to flight;<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3187_676457" id="P3187_676457" name="P3187_676457">50</a></sup> </p>
<p>370 And rather slain the just with slaughter fell;</p>
<p>And, after crime, fraud ever hath in you</p>
<p>Inhered. Ye then shall reap the natural fruit</p>
<p>Of your iniquitous sowing. That God is</p>
<p>Ye know; yet are ye wont to laugh at Him.</p>
<p>375 Into deep darkness ye shall go of fire</p>

<p>The elements convert; and all heaven's fire</p>
<p>Descend in clouds. 3 Then greedy Tartarus</p>
<p>With rapid fire enclosed is; and flame</p>
<p>385 Is fluctuant within with tempest waves;</p>
<p>And the whole earth her whirling embers blends!</p>
<p>There is a flamy furrow; teeth acute</p>
<p>Are turned to plough it, and for all the years<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3210_677516" id="P3210_677516" name="P3210_677516">54</a></sup> </p>
<p>The fiery torrent will be armed: with force</p>
<p>390 Tartarean will the conflagrations gnash</p>
<p>Their teeth upon the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3214_677688" id="P3214_677688" name="P3214_677688">55</a></sup> There are they scorched</p>
<p>In seething tide with course precipitate;</p>
<p>Hence flee; thence back are borne in sharp career;</p>
<p>The savage flame's ire meets them fugitive!</p>
<p>395 And now at length they own the penalty</p>
<p>Their own, the natural issue of their crime.</p>
<p>And now the reeling earth, by not a swain</p>
<p>Possest, is by the sea's profundity</p>
<p>Prest, at her farthest limit, where the sun</p>
<p>400 (His ray out-measured) divides the orb,</p>
<p>And where, when traversed is the world,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3225_678145" id="P3225_678145" name="P3225_678145">56</a></sup> the stars</p>
<p>Are hidden. Ether thickens. O'er the light</p>
<p>Spreads sable darkness; and the latest flames</p>
<p>Stagnate in secret rills. A place there is</p>
<p>405 Whose nature is with sealed penalties</p>
<p>Fiery, and a dreadful marsh white-hot</p>
<p>With heats infernal, where, in furnaces</p>
<p>Horrific, penal deed roars loud, and seethes,</p>
<p>And, rushing into torments, is up-caught</p>
<p>410 By the flame's vortex wide; by savage wave</p>
<p>And surge the turbid sand all mingled is</p>
<p>With miry bottom. Hither will be sent,</p>
<p>Groaning, the captive crowd of evil ones,</p>
<p>And wickedness (the sinful body's train)</p>
<p>415 To burn! Great is the beating there of breasts,</p>
<p>By bellowing of grief accompanied;</p>
<p>Wild is the hissing of the flames, and thence</p>
<p>The ululation of the sufferers!</p>
<p>And flames, and limbs sonorous,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3244_678895" id="P3244_678895" name="P3244_678895">57</a></sup> will outrise</p>
<p>420 Afar: more fierce will the fire burn; and up</p>
<p>To th' upper air the groaning will be borne.</p>
<p>Then human progeny its bygone deeds</p>
<p>Of ill will weigh; and will begin to stretch</p>
<p>Heavenward its palms; and then will wish to know </p>
<p>425 The Lord, whom erst it would not know, what time</p>
<p>To know Him had proved useful to them There,</p>
<p>His life's excesses, handiworks unjust,</p>
<p>And crimes of savage mind, each will confess,</p>
<p>And at the knowledge of the impious deeds</p>
<p>430 of his own life will shudder. And now first,</p>
<p>Whoe'er erewhile cherished ill thoughts of God;</p>
<p>Had worshipped stones unsteady, lyingly</p>
<p>Pretending to divinity; hath e'er</p>
<p>Made sacred to gore-stained images</p>
<p>435 Altars; hath voiceless pictured figures feared;</p>
<p>Hath slender shades of false divinity</p>
<p>Revered; whome'er ill error onward hath</p>
<p>Seduced; whoe'er was an adulterer,</p>
<p>Or with the sword had slain his sons; whoe'er</p>
<p>440 Had stalked in robbery; whoe'er by fraud</p>
<p>His clients had deferred; whoe'er with mind</p>
<p>Unfriendly had behaved himself, or stained</p>
<p>His palms with blood of men, or poison mixt</p>
<p>Wherein death lurked, or robed with wicked guise</p>
<p>445 His breast, or at his neighbour's ill, or gain</p>
<p>Iniquitous, was wont to joy; whoe'er</p>
<p>Committed whatsoever wickedness</p>
<p>Of evil deeds: him mighty heat shall rack,</p>
<p>And bitter fire; and these all shall endure,</p>
<p>450 In passing painful death, their punishment.</p>
<p>Thus shall the vast crowd lie of mourning men!</p>
<p>This oft as holy prophets sang of old,</p>
<p>And (by God's inspiration warned) oft told</p>
<p>The future, none ('tis pity!) none (alas!)</p>
<p>455 Did lend his ears. But God Almighty willed</p>
<p>His guerdons to be known, and His law's threats</p>
<p>'Mid multitudes of such like signs promulged.</p>
<p>He 'stablished them<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3284_680699" id="P3284_680699" name="P3284_680699">58</a></sup> by sending prophets more,</p>
<p>These likewise uttering words divine; and some,</p>
<p>460 Roused from their sleep, He bids go from their tombs</p>
<p>Forth with Himself, when He, His own tomb burst,</p>
<p>Had risen. Many 'wildered were, indeed,</p>
<p>To see the tombs agape, and in clear light</p>
<p>Corpses long dead appear; and, wondering</p>
<p>465 At their discourses pious, dulcet words!</p>
<p>Starward they stretch their palms at the mere sound,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3293_681138" id="P3293_681138" name="P3293_681138">59</a></sup> </p>
<p>And offer God and so-victorious Christ</p>
<p>Their gratulating homage. Certain 'tis</p>
<p>That <i>these</i> no more re-sought their silent graves,</p>
<p>470 Nor were retained within earth's bowels shut;<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3298_681409" id="P3298_681409" name="P3298_681409">60</a></sup> </p>
<p>But the remaining host reposes now</p>
<p>In lowliest beds, until-time's circuit run-</p>
<p>That great day do arrive. Now all of you</p>
<p>Own the true Lord, who alone makes this soul</p>
<p>475 Of ours to see His light,<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3304_681625" id="P3304_681625" name="P3304_681625">61</a></sup> and can the same</p>
<p> (To Tartarus sent) subject to penalties;</p>
<p>And to whom all the power of life and death</p>
<p>Is open. Learn that God <i>can</i> do whate'er</p>
<p>He list; for 'tis enough for Him to <i>will</i>,</p>
<p>480 And by mere speaking He achieves the deed;</p>
<p>And Him nought plainly, by withstanding, checks.</p>
<p>He is my God alone, to whom I trust</p>
<p>With deepest senses. But, since death con</p>
<p>Every career, let whoe'er <i>is</i> to-day</p>
<p>485 Bethink him over all things in his mind.</p>
<p>And thus, while life remains, while 'tis allowed</p>
<p>To see the light and change your life, before</p>
<p>The limit of allotted age o'ertake</p>
<p>You unawares, and that last day, which<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3319_682319" id="P3319_682319" name="P3319_682319">62</a></sup> is</p>
<p>490 By death's law fixt, your senseless eyes do glaze,</p>
<p>Seek what remains worth seeking: watchful be</p>
<p>For dear salvation; and run down with ease</p>
<p>And certainty the good course. Wipe away</p>
<p>By pious sacred rites your past misdeeds</p>
<p>495 Which expiation need; and shun the storms,</p>
<p>The too uncertain tempests, of the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3327_682749" id="P3327_682749" name="P3327_682749">63</a></sup> </p>
<p>Then turn to right paths, and keep sanctities.</p>
<p>Hence from your gladsome minds depraved crime</p>
<p>Quite banish; and let long-inveterate fault</p>
<p>500 Be washed forth from your breast; and do away</p>
<p>Wicked ill-stains contracted; and appease</p>
<p>Dread God by prayers eternal; and let all</p>
<p>Most evil mortal things to living good</p>
<p>Give way: and now at once a new life keep</p>
<p>505 Without a crime; and let your minds begin</p>
<p>To use themselves to good things and to true:</p>
<p>And render ready voices to God's praise.</p>
<p>Thus shall your piety find better things</p>
<p>All growing to a flame; thus shall ye, too,</p>
<p>510 Receive the gifts of the celestial life;<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3342_683363" id="P3342_683363" name="P3342_683363">64</a></sup> </p>
