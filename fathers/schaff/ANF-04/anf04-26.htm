<font size="4">1. A Strain of Jonah the Prophet.</font></h2>
<ul><ul><p>After the living, aye-enduring death</p>
<p>Of Sodom and Gomorrah; after fires</p>
<p>Penal, attested by time-frosted plains</p>
<p>Of ashes; after fruitless apple-growths,</p>
<p>5 Born but to feed the eye; after the death</p>
<p>Of sea and brine, both in like fate involved;</p>
<p>While whatsoe'er is human still retains</p>
<p>In change corporeal its penal badge:<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2083_619990" id="P2083_619990" name="P2083_619990">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>A city-Nineveh-by stepping o'er</p>
<p>10 The path of justice and of equity,</p>
<p>On her own head had well-nigh shaken down</p>
<p>More fires of rain supernal. For what dread<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2088_620288" id="P2088_620288" name="P2088_620288">2</a></sup> </p>
<p>Dwells in a mind subverted? Commonly</p>
<p>Tokens of penal visitations prove</p>
<p>15 All vain where error holds possession. Still,</p>
<p>Kindly and patient of our waywardness,</p>
<p>And slow to punish, the Almighty Lord</p>
<p>Will launch no shaft of wrath, unless He first</p>
<p>Admonish and knock oft at hardened hearts,</p>
<p>20 Rousing with mind august presaging seers.</p>
<p>For to the merits of the Ninevites</p>
<p>The Lord had bidden Jonah to foretell</p>
<p>Destruction; but he, conscious that He spare;</p>
<p>The subject, and remits to suppliants</p>
<p>25 The dues of penalty, and is to good</p>
<p>Ever inclinable, was loth to face</p>
<p>That errand; lest he sing his seerly strain</p>
<p>In vain, and peaceful issue of his threats</p>
<p>Ensue. His counsel presently is flight:</p>
<p>30 (If, howsoe'er, there is at all the power</p>
<p>God to avoid, and shun the Lord's right hand</p>
<p>'Neath whom the whole orb trembles and is held</p>
<p>In check: but is there reason in the act</p>
<p>Which in<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2111_621192" id="P2111_621192" name="P2111_621192">3</a></sup> his saintly heart the prophet dares?)</p>
<p>35 On the beach-lip, over against the shores</p>
<p>Of the Cilicians, is a city poised,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2114_621439" id="P2114_621439" name="P2114_621439">4</a></sup> </p>
<p>Far-famed for trusty port-Joppa her name.</p>
<p>Thence therefore Jonah speeding in a barque</p>
<p>Seeks Tarsus,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2118_621550" id="P2118_621550" name="P2118_621550">5</a></sup> through the signal providence</p>
<p>40 Of the same God;<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2120_621749" id="P2120_621749" name="P2120_621749">6</a></sup> nor marvel is's, I ween,</p>
<p>If, fleeing from the Lord upon the lands,</p>
<p>He found Him in the waves. For suddenly</p>
<p>A little cloud had stained the lower air</p>
<p>With fleecy wrack sulphureous, itself<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2125_621957" id="P2125_621957" name="P2125_621957">7</a></sup> </p>
<p>45 By the wind's seed excited: by degrees,</p>
<p>Bearing a brood globose, it with the sun</p>
<p>Cohered, and with a train caliginous</p>
<p>Shut in the cheated day. The main becomes</p>
<p>The mirror of the sky; the waves are dyed so</p>
<p>50 With black encirclement; the upper air</p>
<p>Down rushes into darkness, and the sea</p>
<p>Uprises; nought of middle space is left;</p>
<p>While the clouds touch the waves, and the waves all</p>
<p>Are mingled by the bluster of the winds</p>
<p>55 In whirling eddy.'Gainst the renegade,</p>
<p>'Gainst Jonah, diverse frenzy joined to rave,</p>
<p>While one sole barque did all the struggle breed</p>
<p>'Twixt sky and surge. From this side and from that</p>
<p>Pounded she reels; 'neath each wave-breaking blow</p>
<p>60 The forest of her tackling trembles all; </p>
<p>As, underneath, her spinal length of keel,</p>
<p>Staggered by shock on shock, all palpitates;</p>
<p>And, from on high, her labouring mass of yard</p>
<p>Creaks shuddering; and the tree-like mast itself</p>
<p>65 Bends to the gale, misdoubting to be riven.</p>
<p>Meantime the rising<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2148_622907" id="P2148_622907" name="P2148_622907">8</a></sup> clamour of the crew</p>
<p>Tries every chance for barque's and dear life's sake:</p>
<p>To pass from hand to hand<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2151_623080" id="P2151_623080" name="P2151_623080">9</a></sup> the tardy coils</p>
<p>To tighten the girth's noose: straitly to bind</p>
<p>70 The tiller's struggles; or, with breast opposed,</p>
<p>T' impel reluctant curves. Part, turn by turn,</p>
<p>With foremost haste outbale the reeking well</p>
<p>Of inward sea. The wares and cargo all</p>
<p>They then cast headlong, and with losses seek</p>
<p>75 Their perils to subdue. At every crash</p>
<p>Of the wild deep rise piteous cries; and out</p>
<p>They stretch their hands to majesties of gods,</p>
<p>Which gods are none; whom might of sea and sky</p>
<p>Fears not, nor yet the less from off their poops</p>
<p>80 With angry eddy sweeping sinks them down.</p>
<p>Unconscious of all this, the guilty one</p>
<p>'Neath the poop's hollow arch was making sleep</p>
<p>Re-echo stertorous with nostril wide</p>
<p>Inflated: whom, so soon as he who guides</p>
<p>85 The functions of the wave-dividing prow</p>
<p>Saw him sleep-bound in placid peace, and proud</p>
<p>In his repose, he, standing o'er him, shook,</p>
<p>And said, "Why sing's", with vocal nostril, dreams,</p>
<p>In such a crisis? In so wild a whirl,</p>
<p>90 Why keep'st thou only harbour? Lo! the wave</p>
<p>Whelms us, and our one hope is in the gods.</p>
<p>Thou also, whosoever is thy god,</p>
<p>Make vows, and, pouring prayers on bended knee,</p>
<p>Win o'er thy country's Sovran!" Then they vote</p>
<p>95 To learn by lot who is the culprit, who</p>
<p>The cause of storm; nor does the lot belie</p>
<p>Jonah: whom then they ask, and ask again,</p>
<p>"Who? whence? who in the world? from what abode,</p>
<p>What people, hail'st thou?" He avows himself</p>
<p>100 A servant, and an over-timid one,</p>
<p>Of God, who raised aloft the sky, who based</p>
<p>The earth, who corporally fused the whole:</p>
<p>A renegade from Him he owns himself,</p>
<p>And tells the reason. Rigid turned they all</p>
<p>105 With dread."What grudge, then, ow'st thou <i>us</i>? What now</p>
<p>Will follow? By what deed shall we appease</p>
<p>The main?" For more and far more swelling grew</p>
<p>The savage surges. Then the seer begins</p>
<p>Words prompted by the Spirit of the Lord:<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2193_625295" id="P2193_625295" name="P2193_625295">10</a></sup> </p>
<p>110"Lo! I your tempest am; I am the sum</p>
<p>Of the world's<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2196_626030" id="P2196_626030" name="P2196_626030">11</a></sup> madness: 'tis in me," he says,</p>
<p>"That the sea rises, and the upper air</p>
<p>Down rushes; land in me is far, death near,</p>
<p>And hope in God is none! Come, headlong hurl</p>
<p>115 Your cause of bane: lighten your ship, and cast</p>
<p>This single mighty burden to the main,</p>
<p>A willing prey!" But they-all vainly!-strive</p>
<p>Homeward to turn their course; for helm refused</p>
<p>To suffer turning, and the yard's stiff poise</p>
<p>120 Willed not to change. At last unto the Lord</p>
<p>They cry: "For one soul's sake give us not o'er</p>
<p>Unto death's maw, nor let us be besprent</p>
<p>With righteous blood, if thus Thine own right hand</p>
<p>Leadeth." And from the eddy's depth a whale</p>
<p>125 Outrising on the spot, scaly with shells,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2211_626692" id="P2211_626692" name="P2211_626692">12</a></sup> </p>
<p>Unravelling his body's train, 'gan urge</p>
<p>More near the waves, shocking the gleaming brine,</p>
<p>Seizing-at God's command-the prey; which, rolled</p>
<p>From the poop's summit prone, with slimy jaws</p>
<p>130 He sucked; and into his long belly sped</p>
<p>The living feast; and swallowed, with the man,</p>
<p>The rage of sky and main. The billowy waste</p>
<p>Grows level, and the ether's gloom dissolves;</p>
<p>The waves on this side, and the blasts on that, </p>
<p>135 Are to their friendly mood restored; and, where</p>
<p>The placid keel marks out a path secure,</p>
<p>White traces in the emerald furrow bloom.</p>
<p>The sailor then does to the reverend Lord</p>
<p>Of death make grateful offering of his fear;<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2226_627401" id="P2226_627401" name="P2226_627401">13</a></sup> </p>
<p>140 Then enters friendly ports. Jonah the seer</p>
<p>The while is voyaging, in other craft</p>
<p>Embarked, and cleaving 'neath the lowest waves</p>
<p>A wave: his sails the intestines of the fish,</p>
<p>Inspired with breath ferine; himself, shut in;</p>
<p>145 By waters, yet untouched; in the sea's heart</p>
<p>And yet beyond its reach; 'mid wrecks of fleets</p>
<p>Half-eaten, and men's carcasses dissolved</p>
<p>In putrid disintegrity: in life</p>
<p>Learning the process of his death; but still-</p>
<p>150 To be a sign hereafter of the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2238_628243" id="P2238_628243" name="P2238_628243">14</a></sup> -</p>
<p>A witness was he (in his very self),<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2240_628326" id="P2240_628326" name="P2240_628326">15</a></sup> </p>
