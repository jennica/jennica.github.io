<sup>10 </sup>See IV. 30.</p>
<p><a name="P6005_2081134"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>Probably because of the inferior value in Italy of Gallic gold. "Nullus solidum integri ponderis calumniosoe approbationis obtentu recuset exactor, excepto eo Gallico cujus aurum minore oestimatione taxatur." <i>Novella Majoriani</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P6006_2081529"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>Some kind of due, so-called. See Du Cange under Ablata: -"Abatio, Exactio, Tolta. . . 'Liberos deinceps esse constituimus ab omni tallia, ablatione et exactione, et questu.' (A. 1173).' </p>
<p><a name="P6014_2084432"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>This form of protest against simony is found, in the same words, in several other letters.</p>
<p><a name="P6024_2087209"></a>
<sup>14 </sup><i>Institutionis</i>; a legal term, denoting apparently the constituting of a person as an inheriter. </p>
<p><a name="P6028_2089260"></a>
<sup>15 </sup><font>On the case of John of Chalcedon and Athanasius of Isaura, referred to in this and the three following letters, see III. 53, note 9.</font></p>
<p><a name="P6031_2090896"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>Cf. VII. 34 and IX. 49, where the same argument, in nearly the same words, is set forth.</p>
<p><a name="P6032_2091823"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>The reference may be to Canon xxviii. of the Council ofChalcedon, assigning rank and jurisdiction to the patriarchs of Constantinople, which was protested against by the Roman legates at the Council and afterwards disallowed by Pope Leo. It is omitted in the Latin version of the canons published by Dionysius Exiguus about the beginning of the sixth century, though it had been in the<i> Prisca Versio</i> which he amended.It appears as if Gregory, not finding it in the Latin version before him, supposed it to have been interpolated at Constantinople; the fact being that it had been purposely omitted at Rome, as not having the Pope's sanction. If such is the allusion, it may seem strange that Gregory did not know the circumstances better. But this is not the only instance of his imperfect knowledge of past events, even in ecclesiastical matters. Cf. II. 51, note 2.</p>
<p><a name="P6060_2102157"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>Baptisteries were anciently buildings contiguous to but apart from the churches. Cf. III. 59, note 7.</p>
<p><a name="P6065_2103726"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>See III. 53, note 9, and <i>reff</i> there. It seems from what Gregory here says, that it was not in the East only, but also in Italy, at Ravenna, that the authority of the Roman See met with opposition, perhaps mainly on the ground of Ravenna having been an Imperial city, and being still the seat of the Exarch, of Italy. Cf. III. 57, note 4.</p>
<p><a name="P6066_2104904"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>Spatam. Cf. VI. 61, note 8.</p>
<p><a name="P6070_2105259"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>See III 47, note. 2. </p>
<p><a name="P6076_2110173"></a>
<sup>22 </sup>In the letter to the Salonitans, which follows, it appears that Honoratus only among the clergy of Salona (having been the rival candidate for the bishopric and supported by the Pope), and Paulinus only among the suffragan bishops, had refused to communicate with Maximus.</p>
<p><a name="P6080_2111043"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>See III. 47, note 2. </p>
<p><a name="P6088_2114181"></a>
<sup>24 </sup><font>See III. 47, note 2. Jadera was one of the sees in the province of Dalmatia of which Salona was the Metropolis. The bishop of Jadera, Sabinianus, had communicated with Maximus, and probably assisted in ordaining him, but afterwards repented. See below, VII. 17; VIII. l0, 24. It may have been because Gregory had heard that there was already a party in Jadera prepared to renounce Maximus that he wrote this letter to strengthen it. </font></p>
<p><a name="P6096_2118230"></a>
<sup>25 </sup>Cf. above, VI. 1.</p>
