<sup>1 </sup><i>Servatorum.</i> I am not sure whether this is the right sense; others read <i>multorum</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P2004_469380"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>In Lett. CXI., chap. ii., he is said to have been <i>coemeterio deputatis</i>, and, according to Quesnel, when the cemeteries (or catacombs) had no longer to be used as refuges for the persecuted Christians, the custom had grown up of putting priests in charge to perpetuate the memory of the martyrs therein buried; in process of time, when love grew cold, this was looked upon as a sort of exile, and an onerous duty in consequence. </p>
<p><a name="P2011_474382"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>There had been riots among the monks of Egypt about the appointment of Proterius as bishop, instead of Dioscorus, deposed.</p>
<p><a name="P2015_474986"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>This is Letter XXXV. (<i>q.v</i>.).</p>
<p><a name="P2016_475406"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>It is, of course, well known that Leo knew no Greek whatever. </p>
<p><a name="P2047_479343"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>This is Eudocia, the widow of Theodosius II., and the Prince, her son, mentioned below, is Valentinianus III., who had married her daughter Eudoxia. The letter of Leo here mentioned is probably not Letter CXXIII. below. For a graphic sketch of the elder lady see Gore's Life of Leo, pp. 131, 2. </p>
<p><a name="P2051_480762"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Cf. Letter CXIII. above.</p>
<p><a name="P2055_481674"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>This is Euxitheus, the successor of Anastasius: Letter CL. is addressed to him.</p>
<p><a name="P2069_484210"></a>
<sup>1 </sup><i>Ratio sacramenti.</i></p>
<p><a name="P2073_484984"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>These were apparently twenty in number, but include no very important towns except Seleucia the seaport of Antioch. </p>
<p><a name="P2077_486755"></a>
<sup>3 </sup><i>Privilegia tertioe sedis</i>. Leo here still assigns to Antioch the third place in order of precedence, Rome and Alexandria being first and second respectively; but since 381, as we have seen, e.g. in Lett. XCVIII., chap. iv.. it had been lowered to the 4th I..ce by the insertion of Constantinople between Rome and Alexandria: see Schaff's Hist., Vol. II. ยง 56, pp. 277 and following, and Gore's Leo, pp. 119 and foll.</p>
<p><a name="P2081_488896"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>It is a curious fact in the history of Church government that the bishopric of Jerusalem for the first centuries never had the first place in Palestine: this was assigned to the metropolitan of Coesarea, although on great occasions the Bishop of Jerusalem sat next to the patriarch of Antioch: cf. Schaff's Hist., Vol. II. 56, p. 283, and the viith. Nicene canon: <i>mos antiquus obtineat ut Aelioe, id est Ierosolymoe, episcopus honoretur salva metroplois propria dignitate.</i></p>
<p><a name="P2082_489487"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>The Ballerinii point out that the 1st Council of Ephesus was held in 431, at which Cyril presided for Celestinus I. of Rome and that Leo was not bishop till 44; this letter was probably, addressed to him when archdeacon of Rome, in which case the authority which he had already gained is remarkably illustrated. </p>
<p><a name="P2089_491716"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>See Lett. CXX., chap. vi., note</p>
<p><a name="P2098_492927"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Ps. cxxiii. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P2099_493797"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>These were, of course, the bishops of Illyricum and Palestine, who raised objections at various points in the reading of Leo's Tome at Chalcedon. They were allowed five days to reconsider the matter, and ultimately yielded their consent. See Introduction, p. x., and Bright's notes to the Tome, who gives their objections and answers in detail, esp. nn. 148, 156, 160, and 173. </p>
