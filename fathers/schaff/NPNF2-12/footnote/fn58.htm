<p><a name="P5809_1992078"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>Viz. John bishop of Ravenna, as to whom see III. 56, 57; V. 11, 15. Marinianus was elected in his place. See VI. 34, 61.</p>
<p><a name="P5810_1993599"></a>
<sup>21 </sup><i>De proecedentibus</i>. Al. <i>de proecedentibus</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P5814_1994082"></a>
<sup>22 </sup>Viz. John, bishop of Ravenna. See Ep. 23.</p>
<p><a name="P5818_1994576"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>Cf. II. 6, note 3.</p>
<p><a name="P5822_1995074"></a>
<sup>24 </sup><font>We have in this epistle the form of appointment to the office of <i>Defensor Ecclesioe</i>. Cf. XI. 38. From IX. 62 it appears that the functions of the office had in some cases been usurped by persons not duly authorized, as it is there ordered that none should be recognized but such as possessed letters of appointment. The only duties of the office specified in this form of appointment have reference to the poor- "pro pauperum commodis;" but it is evident from the many epistles addressed to <i>defensores</i>, that they had a much wider scope. See <i>Prolegomena</i>, p. vii.</font></p>
<p><a name="P5829_1997068"></a>
<sup>25 </sup>Or <i>Scribo</i> may be the official designation of the officer commissioned to distribute the imperial bounty. Cf. II. 32, note 7.</p>
<p><a name="P5830_1998165"></a>
<sup>26 </sup>Or <i>Scribo</i> may be the official designation of the officer commissioned to distribute the imperial bounty. Cf. II. 32, note 7.</p>
<p><a name="P5834_1998603"></a>
<sup>27 </sup>"SCHOLASTICUS - Quivis eloquens, disertus, oratorioe facultatis et politiaris literaturoe studiis eruditus.-Advocatus, patronus, qui causam in foro agit; sed proprie peritus, eloquens, disertus patronus (<i>Cod. Theod</i>)." [D'Arnis' Lexicon Manuale.] Severus may be concluded to have been the Exarch's legal adviser.</p>
<p><a name="P5839_2000856"></a>
<sup>28 </sup><font>See I. 7, note 5. Anastasius had now been recently restored to his patriarchal see. </font></p>
<p><a name="P5843_2004369"></a>
<sup>29 </sup>The expression is found in the spurious, but not in what are held to be the genuine, epistles of St. Ignatius.</p>
<p><a name="P5844_2004638"></a>
<sup>30 </sup>For Gregory's view of Antioch having been St. Peter's see previously to his presiding over that of Rome, and of the sees of Rome, Alexandria, and Antioch jointly representing the see of the Prince of the Apostle's, see especially VII. 40. Cf. also VI. 60; VIII. 2; X. 35.</p>
<p><a name="P5845_2004958"></a>
<sup>31 </sup><i>Benedictio</i>, meaning <i>a present</i>. See IV. 31, note 9. </p>
<p><a name="P5851_2007126"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>This may be an ironical allusion to something the Emperor had said in his letter to Gregory. </p>
<p><a name="P5856_2013322"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>For the circumstances referred to in this epistle, see <i>Proleg</i>., p. xix. It shews how outspoken Gregory could be, when greatly moved, in addressing the Emperor, notwithstanding his accustomed deference.</p>
<p><a name="P5862_2014706"></a>
<sup>34 </sup>i.e. the payment to the imperial government required from judges or other functionaries in consideration of their appointment. "SUFFRAGIUM. Pecunioe quoe suffragii titulo ab Imperatoribus accipiebantur cum honores deferebant, quoe <font face="SPIonic">despotika</font><font>; vocantur in formula jurisjurandi.- Novelloe Justiniani 8, cujus titulus est, <i>ut judices sine suffragio fiant</i>." Du Cange.</font></p>
<p><a name="P5863_2015892"></a>
<sup>35 </sup><i>Titulos</i>, i e. notices put upon properties, asserting claim, or announcing sale, &amp;c. </p>
<p><a name="P5870_2018951"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>Romanus Patricius, the Exarch.</p>
<p><a name="P5872_2019808"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Viz. of Antioch. </p>
<p><a name="P5878_2022819"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>Cf. V. 18, and note. </p>
<p><a name="P5889_2030988"></a>
<sup>39 </sup><font>On the term , "Scholasticus," see V. 36 note 9. It appears from this and other epistles that persons thus designated were addressed as "Gloria vestra." The "Patrician" mentioned in this letter as having recommended the Archdeacon Donatus to succeed John as Archbishop of Ravenna, was Romanus Patricius, Exarch of Italy, who dieda.d.598. He is often addressed or referred to in the Epistles. See Index.</font></p>
