<sup>31 </sup>See I. 44, note 1. </p>
<p><a name="P5102_1655510"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>Maximianus (as appears from Epistle 34), whom Gregory had himself appointed bishop Syracuse. Cf. II. 7, and note.</p>
<p><a name="P5103_1656411"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>This Eusebius was an abbot in Sicily. Letters follow about him to Maximianus (<i>Ep</i>. 34), and to him (<i>Ep</i>. 36).</p>
<p><a name="P5105_1656852"></a>
<sup>34 </sup><i>Scribonibus</i>. The term denoted officers sent from the imperial court into the provinces for executing certain duties; in this case for raising recruits for the imperial army. Cf. V. 30, note 8.</p>
<p><a name="P5106_1657168"></a>
<sup>35 </sup><i>Parum aliquid xenii</i>. On <i>xenia</i>, see II. 23, note 8.</p>
<p><a name="P5110_1659252"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>We note here the sarcastic vein in which Gregory from time to time pleasantly stimulates Peter to activity.</p>
<p><a name="P5112_1660465"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>I.e. the <i>rector patrimonii</i>. The purport of this direction seems be that agents from the laity might be appointed with advantage to assist the <i>rector patrimonii</i>; and these must first be made <i>clerici</i> by receiving the tonsure, so as to be qualified to act for the Church. The rectors themselves were usually at least subdeacons. </p>
<p><a name="P5114_1660940"></a>
<sup>38 </sup><i>Scholastici</i>. The designation appears to have been applied generally to scholarly and learned persons. Cf. Hieron. <i>in Catal. Scriptor. Eccles</i>., "Serapion ob elegantiam ingenii cognomen scholastici meruit." In Gregory's Epistles it seems to denote usually men learned in the law, who might advise on legal points or sit as assessors. In I. 44 (to Peter the subdeacon) <i>scholastici</i> are spoken of as having given a legal opinion , Epistle 36 in Bk. IX. is addressed "Severo scholastico exarchi," and he is spoken of as one of those "qui assistant judicibus." Cf. also IX. 58, 59, for the employment of "Martinus Scholasticus,vir eloquentissimus," in a cave of disputed jurisdiction over the primate of the African province of Bizacia. Such <i>scholastici</i> were evidently persons of importance. Gregory addresses them by the title of "Gloria vestra" (IV. 40), and of "Magnitudo tua" (IX. 58). In IX. 12 he speaks of the form of prayer which followed the words of institution in the Canon of the Mass as having been composed by a <i>scholasticus</i> (<i>precem quam schloasticus composuerat</i>), perhaps using the term in the general sense of a scholar.</p>

<sup>39 </sup>See I. 46, note.</p>
<p><a name="P5117_1663416"></a>
<sup>40 </sup>See I. 61, note 7.</p>
<p><a name="P5118_1663675"></a>
<sup>41 </sup><i>Proepositi</i>. The word, though used also in a more general sense, usually denotes the Prior of a monastery, appointed as the Abbot's vice-gerent.</p>
<p><a name="P5119_1664066"></a>
<sup>42 </sup><i>Episcopi Laurinensis</i>. If the reading is correct, the See intended is unknown. Holstein (<i>Annot. in Geograph. Sacra</i>, p. 21) suggests <i>Carinensem</i>, denoting the Sicilian See of Carine, or Camarina.</p>
<p><a name="P5120_1664409"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>I.e. the first seven books of the Bible.</p>
<p><a name="P5123_1664628"></a>
<sup>44 </sup><font>Now Proetor of Sicily. Cf. I. 2.</font></p>
<p><a name="P5126_1664990"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>Bishop of Catana in Sicily. Cf. I. 72. </p>
<p><a name="P5139_1669167"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>See I. 79, note 5.</p>
<p><a name="P5140_1669834"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>See as above.</p>
<p><a name="P5151_1676687"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>The text here ("nullis canonicis juris deserviant") appears to be corrupt, being unintelligible. The sense of the corresponding clause in the shorter Epistle has been given in the translation.</p>
<p><a name="P5156_1677607"></a>
<sup>49 </sup><i>Processio</i> usually denotes the celebration of Mass.</p>
<p><a name="P5160_1678212"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>For elucidation of the circumstances of this Epistle see above, Epistles 3, 29, 30.</p>
<p><a name="P5162_1678947"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Viz. Romanus Patricius, mentioned below, the Exarch of Ravenna, and as such representing the Emperor in Italy. See I. 33, "Ad Romanum Patricium et Exarchum Italioe."</p>
<p><a name="P5163_1679384"></a>
<sup>52 </sup><i>Precaria</i>; apparently subsidies demanded for the supportof the invading army. <i>Precarium</i> (or <i>Precarim</i>), which has various applications, appears to be capable of this sense. See Du Cange.</p>
<p><a name="P5165_1679687"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>The Istrian bishops still held out in refusing to accept thecondemnation of "The Three Chapters" passed in the fifth (Ecumenical Council at the instance of the Emperor Justinian. Gregory, soon after his accession, had suummoned Severus, Bishop of Aquileia and Metropolitan, with his suffragans, to Rome; and this, as he alleges, by command of the Emperor, though the latter had now, it appears, forbidden further proceedings See I. 16, and note.</p>
<p><a name="P5167_1681141"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>I.e. the soldiers of the Theodosian Legion.</p>
<p><a name="P5170_1682325"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>With respect to Rome Gregory has already complained that the Exarch would neither send forces for its defence nor allow peace to be made with Ariulph. So also witb regard to Naples, which Gregory understands to be now threatened by the Lombards. The Exarch, it appears, had been urgent in insisting that it should hold out against the enemy ("excellentissimo exarcho instanter imminente"), but without giving any help for the purpose. What Gregory here says is that without aid from the Exarch its defence was hopeless.</p>
<p><a name="P5171_1682953"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Aragis was the Lombard duke of Beneventum.</p>
<p><a name="P5173_1683349"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>Viz. Aquileia, of which Severus was bishop and Metropolitan called here <i>schismaticus</i> because of his holding out against Rome in the matter of the Three Chapters. The bribes he is said below to have sent to Constantinople would be for inducing the Emperor to take his part against Gregory.</p>
<p><a name="P5175_1684730"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>See above, Ep. 20, in this Book, and I. 19, note 5, where references to other Epistles are given.</p>
<p><a name="P5176_1685101"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>See II. 20, note 5.</p>
<p><a name="P5180_1685424"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>The bishop of Carthage was primate of the province of Africa Proconsularis in virtue of his See. For the custom with regard to primacy in other African provinces, see I. 74, note 2. The fact, apparent from this letter, that Dominicus had deemed sending to Gregory on his accession the congratulatory letter that had been expected, and Gregory's carefulness to assure him, in the course of the studiously courteous letter, of his desire to respect the ancient privileges of Churches, may be among the symptoms, otherwise apparent, of the authoritative claims of the Roman See being still viewed with some jealousy in the African Church. Cf. in Book VIII. Epistle 33, to the same Dominicus, in which Gregory, in praising his reverence for the Apostolic See, attributes such reverence to his knowledge of the origin of the African episcopacy, refraining from asserting in this case any prerogative of divine right belonging to the See of S. Peter. Other letters to Dominicus are V. 5; VII. 35; XII. 1. </p>
<p><a name="P5183_1689664"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>In <i>English Bible</i>, cxxxix. 21.</p>
<p><a name="P5188_1691078"></a>
<sup>62 </sup><font>This Columbus was one of the bishops in Numidia, who seems to have enjoyed the peculiar confidence of Gregory, being written to on various questions concerning the Church there, and charged with seeing to the exercise of discipline over other bishops, though not himself the primate. He is addressed (III. 68; VIII. 13) as being himself especially devoted to the Roman See. Other letters addressed to him are III. 48; IV. 35; VI. 37; VII. 2; VIII. 28; XII. 8; XII. 28. </font></p>
<p><a name="P5191_1692745"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>The Donatists had formerly been allowed their own bishop, tolerated along with the Catholic ones. This liberty was now disallowed, probably in accordance with imperial edicts. See I 74, note 8. </p>
