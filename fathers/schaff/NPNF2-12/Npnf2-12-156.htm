<font size="4">Letter CLVIII<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2457_566347" id="P2457_566347" name="P2457_566347">1</a></sup> . To the Catholic Bishops of Egypt Sojourning in Constantinople.</font></h2>
<ul><p><i>Leo to the catholic Egyptian bishops sojourning in Constantinople.He encourages them in their sufferings for the Faith, and in their entreaties for redress to the Emperor.</i></p>
</ul><p>I have before now been so saddened by tidings of the crimes committed in Alexandria, and my spirit has been so wounded by the atrocity of the deed itself, that I know not what tears to show and what lamentation to utter over it, and am fain to use the prophet's language, "who will give waters to my head and a fountain of tears to my eyes<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2460_567326" id="P2460_567326" name="P2460_567326">2</a></sup> ?" Yet anticipating your complaint, beloved, I have entreated our most clement and Christian Emperor for a remedy of these great evils, and by our sons and assistants Gerontius and Olympius have at a different time demanded that he should make haste to purge of a heresy already condemned the church of that city, in which so many Catholic teachers have flourished, and not allow murderous spirits whom no reverence for place or time<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2461_567783" id="P2461_567783" name="P2461_567783">3</a></sup> could deter from shedding their ruler's blood, to gain anything from his clemency, more particularly when they desire to reconsider the council of Chalcedon to the overthrow of the Faith. Accordingly the same reason, beloved, which drove you from your own Sees, ought to console you for your sufferings; for it, is certain that afflicted souls, that suffer adversity for His name, are in no wise deprived of the Lord's protection. Bear it therefore bravely, and mindful of that country which is yours, rejoice over your present sojourn in a strange land. Abstain from grieving over your exile and indulge not in sorrow for your present weariness, ye who know that the Apostle glories even in his many perils on behalf of the Lord's Faith. You have One who knows your conflicts and has prepared the rewards of recompense. Let no one shrink from this labour, whose guerdon is to reign and<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2462_568760" id="P2462_568760" name="P2462_568760">4</a></sup> live for ever. Let the feet of all who fight be fixed in the halls of Jerusalem; for in the hope of that retribution they will have no cause to fear the camp nor the onsets of the enemy. Victory is never hard nor triumph difficult over the remnants of an abject foe who has been routed by the whole world alike, especially over those whose ringleaders you see already prostrate. With unceasing prayers, therefore (even as I also have not failed to do), entreat the favour of the most Christian Emperor, who in God's mercy is ready to hear: that in accordance with the letter I have sent<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2463_569460" id="P2463_569460" name="P2463_569460">5</a></sup> , he may strengthen the cause of the common Faith with that devotion of mind, which we are well assured he possesses, and in his piety may remove all the harmful charges which the madness of heretics has invented, and arrange for your return, beloved, and so may cause each several province and all the churches with their priests to rejoice in the unshaken peace of Christ. Dated the 1st of Dec. in the consulship of Constantine and Rufus (457).</p>
