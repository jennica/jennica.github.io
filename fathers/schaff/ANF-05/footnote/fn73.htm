<sup>2 </sup>Moreover, that it was manifest from their deceitful results, that nothing could be referred to auspices or auguries; nay, even those who acknowledged both one God and the demons, allowed that these illusions were the work of the demons, according to the testimony of the poets themselves, and Socrates, Plato, Trismegistus, and Hostanes. The second point, that God is one, he makes evident in a few words, as well from the greater dignity of a monarchy than of other forms of I government, as Crom the very expressions of the heathen and of the common people -" 0 God!" and the like. Finally, he treats of Christ more at large, crom the Jewish prophets and from the evangelical history. </p>

<sup>8 </sup>The following passage, accepted in some editions, is of doubtful authenticity; "To such an extent, indeed, were feigned the names of gods among the Romans, that there is even among them a god, Viduus, who widows the body from the soul-who, as being sap and funereal, is not kept within the walls, but placed outside; but who nevertheless, in that he is excluded, is rather condemned by the Roman religion than worshipped. There is also Scansus, so-called from ascents, and Forculus from doors, and Limentinus Crom thresholds, and Cardea from hinges, and Orbona from bereavement."</p>

<sup>14 </sup>"Of greater obedience and of stronger faith" is a varied reading here.</p>
<p><a name="P7380_2446659"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Some add, "and discipline."</p>
<p><a name="P7381_2446966"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>" With the co-operation of the Holy Spirit," is perhaps a more probable reading. [See vol. iii. p. 609.]</p>

<sup>19 </sup>[John x. 18 See Pearson, <i>Creed</i>, art. v. p. 424] </p>
<p><a name="P7393_2451254"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Eusebius in his <i>ronicon</i>makes mention of the occasion on which Cyprian wrote this treatise, saying, "A pestilent disease took possession of many provinces of the whole world, and especially Alexandria and Egypt; as Dionysius writes, and the treatise of Cypnan `concerning the Mortality0' bears witness." A.D. 252.</p>
<p><a name="P7396_2451676"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>He says: "By whom were Christians,-grieved with excessive fondness at the loss of their friends, or what is of more consequence, with their decrease of faith,-comforted with the hope of things to come?" [See p. kg, <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P7397_2452691"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Then to the tacit objection that by this mortality they would be deprived of martyrdom, he replies that martyrdom is not in our power, and that even the spirit that is ready for martyrdom is crowned by God the judge. Finally, he tells them that the dead must not be bewailed in such a matter as that we should become a stumblingblock to the Gentiles, as if we were without the hope of a resurrec-tion. Rut if also the day of our summons should come, we must depart hence with a glad mind to the Lord, especially since we are departing to our country, where the large number of those dear to us are waiting for us: a dense and abundant multitude are longing for us, who, being already secure of their own immortality, are still solicitous about our salvation.</p>
