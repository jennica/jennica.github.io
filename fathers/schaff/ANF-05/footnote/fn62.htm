<sup>3 </sup>The sense of this passage has been doubted but seems to be this: "The rite of confirmation, or the giving of the Holy Ghost, is of no avail unless baptism have first been conferred. For only by being born <i>of each sacrament</i>, scil. confirmation and baptism, can they be fully sanctified and be born again; since it is written, `Except a man be born of <i>water</i>and of the<i> Spirit</i>,0' etc; which quotation is plainly meant to convey, that the birth of water is by <i>baptism</i>, that of the Spirit by <i>confirmation</i>."</p>
