<sup>5 </sup>[ Ps. lxiv. 3. The revilings of the multitude are reckoned by the Psalmist among the most cruel tortures of Christ: and we cannot doubt that the early Christians found the like cruelty of the heathen a daily martyrdom, before they came to their crowning passion. Compare Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 712.]</p>

<p><a name="P9710_3011947"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>[The heathen attributed this pestilence to the "atheism" of Christians, and hence persecuted them the more fiercely; and, as it was better to die by martyrdom than by the pestilence, he thus speaks. Death an advantage. Shaks., <i>Hen. V</i>., act. iv. sc. 1.]</p>

<sup>15 </sup>[The terrible pictures in S. Stefano Rotondo (see p. 288, <i>supra</i>] might seem to have been taken from this graphic treatise. Can our faith and love be compared with that of these sufferers?] </p>
<p><a name="P9724_3021703"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>[To me, these dramatic narrations of what was going on among the crowds that gazed upon the tortures of Christ's witnesses, are very suggestive of the whole scene. Compare pp. 295-296, <i>supra</i>.]</p>

<sup>23 </sup>[The adoption of "the sign of the cross," after the immersion of baptism, is referable to this martyr-age. It was meant to impress the idea of soldiership.]</p>

<sup>34 </sup>[" Si tamen qui Christi compares estis aliquando peccastis;" not very happily translated, but extravagant at best.]</p>
<p><a name="P9758_3046602"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>[Think, I say again, of three hundred years of such "fiery trial," so marvellously sustained, and we shall gain new views of Christ's power to perfect His own strength in human weakness. The life of these Christians was a conscious daily warfare against "the world, the flesh, and the devil;" and we must recognise this in all judgments of their discipline and their modes of thought.] </p>

<sup>12 </sup>[Turtullian, vol. iv. pp. 74, 97, etc.] </p>
<p><a name="P9786_3065204"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>This passage is allowed by all to be corrupt. If we were to punctuate differently, to insert "nisi" before "consummata," and change "longe est" into "non deesset," we get the following sense: "Therefore we should always meditate, brethren, on chastity, as circumstances teach us, that it may be more easy for us. It depends on no arts; for what is it but perfected will, which, if it were not checked, would certainly not fail to arise? And it is our own will, too: therefore it has not to be acquired, but we have to cherish what is already our own."</p>
<p><a name="P9788_3067658"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>[" Kalendarium cujusvis excedunt." The <i> kalendaria</i> were tablets of monthly accounts, in which the monthly interest due, etc., were set down. "Exceed the entire monthly income" would be better. Tertullian uses the same word, "exhaust the <i> kalendarium</i>," rendered by our Edinburgh translator ( vol. iv. p. 18), a "fortune." In this treatise Tertullian is constantly copied and quoted.]</p>
<p><a name="P9790_3069829"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>[Laughter, vol. ii. p. 249, and contact p. 291.] </p>
<p><a name="P9792_3071197"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>[Everything in antiquity breathes this spirit of "searching the Scriptures." Compare Hippol., p. 219, note 4, <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P9797_3071373"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[Almost wholly made up of Scripture, and useful in any age to all Christians. Whatever its origin, it breathes a truly primitive spirit. Compare Tertullian, vol. iii. p. 657.]</p>
