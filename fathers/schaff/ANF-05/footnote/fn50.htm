<p><a name="P5000_1517504"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Comp. Ep, xiii. to the Roman clergy.</p>
<p><a name="P5003_1519854"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[Another instance of this usage (<font face="SPIonic">kat= ecoxhn</font>), of which see p. 291, <i>supra</i>.] </p>
<p><a name="P5005_1521610"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>[Note the moderation of our author. 1 Pet. v. 5.]</p>
<p><a name="P5010_1522104"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxxvii. In the autumn of A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5014_1522455"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>"Further, that you came to them in such way as you could enter: that you refreshed their minds, robust in their own faith and confession, by your appeals and your letters; that, accompanying their happiness with deserved praises, you inflamed them to a much more ardent desire for heavenly glory; that you urged them onward in the course; that you animated, as we believe and hope, future victors by the power of your address, so that, although all this may seem to come from the faith of the confessors and the divine indulgence, yet in their martyrdom they may seem in some manner to have become debtors to you."</p>
<p><a name="P5016_1523875"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[i.e., confessorship. As to the time, see Treatise ii. <i>infra</i>.] </p>
<p><a name="P5025_1529749"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxiii. A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5029_1529885"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>"Cypriano Papae," to "Pope" Cyprian. [An instance illustrative of what is to be found on p. 54, <i>supra</i>. See also Elucidation III. p. 154, <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P5035_1530541"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxvi. A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5039_1530877"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Isa. lxvi. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P5040_1531481"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[Elucidation V,]</p>
<p><a name="P5041_1531728"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>[The affectionate and general usage of primitive bishops to seek the <i>consensus fratrum</i>, is noteworthy.] </p>
<p><a name="P5047_1532732"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxiv. A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5051_1533041"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>[The community of this term, <i>presbyters</i>, has been noted. See p 156, <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P5052_1533260"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>"Some" would seem to be correct (Goldhom); but it has no authority.</p>
<p><a name="P5053_1533361"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>[i.e., to idols, or the imperial image.]</p>
<p><a name="P5054_1533638"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>"Presbyterium subministrabat" assisted, probably as vicar or curate.</p>
<p><a name="P5055_1534196"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>[A very touching incident, dramatically narrated.]</p>
<p><a name="P5060_1534759"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxv. A. D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5065_1536246"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Probably the treatise, <i>On the Lapsed</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P5066_1536797"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[A beautiful specimen of obedience to the precept, 1 Pet. v. 5.] </p>
<p><a name="P5071_1536930"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxi. A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5076_1538270"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>"Florida," <i>scil</i>. "purpurea," purpled, that is, with blood. See concluding section of Ep. viii. The Oxford translator has "empurpled."</p>
<p><a name="P5078_1539551"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[Written at Easter, like the first Epistle to the Corinthians, as implied in cap. v. 7. See Conybeare and Howson.]</p>
<p><a name="P5079_1539798"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The Oxford edition has a variation here, as follows: "Until our Lord Jesus Christ afford help, and pity be manifested through you, or through those my lords who may have been crowned, from whom you will entreat that these dreadful shipwrecks may be pardoned."</p>
<p><a name="P5081_1541099"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Ps. xx. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P5082_1541202"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This seems altogether unintelligible: the original is probably corrupt. [It seems to relate to the sort of <i>priesthood</i>which was conceded to all martyrs, in view of (Rev. i. 6 and v. 10) the message sent b the angel "to His servants," and by their servant or minister, John.]</p>
<p><a name="P5083_1541808"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Dodwell conjectures this name to be from <font face="SPIonic">atuxousa</font>(unhappy) or <font face="SPIonic">aekousa</font>(unwilling), and applies it to Candida.</p>
<p><a name="P5084_1542061"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>A spot in the Roman Forum which must of necessity be passed by in the ascent to the Capitol. It would appear that Candida therefore repented of her purpose of sacrificing, when she was actually on her way to effect it.</p>
<p><a name="P5085_1542416"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>[i.e., the clergy administering jurisdiction.]</p>
<p><a name="P5086_1542557"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>i.e., in the room of Fabian. </p>
<p><a name="P5088_1543466"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>[i e., to Ostia or Portus].</p>
<p><a name="P5093_1544364"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Oxford ed.: Ep. xxii. A.D. 250.</p>
<p><a name="P5098_1545296"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>The emperor Decius.</p>
<p><a name="P5099_1545531"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>The passage is hopelessly confused.</p>
