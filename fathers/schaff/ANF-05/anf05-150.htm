<sup>1 </sup>The four of the MSS. of the first book extant prior to the recent discovery of seven out of the remaining nine books of <i>The Refutation</i>, concur in ascribing it to Origen. These inscriptions run thus: 1. "Refutation by Orison of all Heresies;" 2. "Of Origen's Philosophumena... these are the contents;" 3. "Being estimable (Dissertations) by Origen, a man of the greatest wisdom." The recently discovered MS. itself in the margin has the words, "Origen, and Origen's opinion." The title, as agreed upon by modern commentators, is: 1. "Book I. of Origen's Refutation of all Heresies" (Wolf and Gronovius); 2. "A Refutation of all Heresies; " 3. "Origen's Philosophumena, or the Refutation of all Heresies." The last is Stiller's in his Oxford edition, 1851. The title might have been, "Philosophumena, and the Refutation (therefrom) of all Heresies." There were obviously two divisions of the work: (1) A <i>resume</i> of the tenets of the philosophers (books i., ii., iii., iv.), preparatory to (2) the refutation of heresies, on the ground of their derivative character from Greek and Egyptian speculation. Bunsen would denominate the work "St. Hippolytus' (Bishop and Martyr) Refutation of all Heresies; what remains of the ten books."</p>
<p><a name="P269_32288"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Most of what follows in book i. is a compilation from ancient sources. The ablest <i>resume</i> followed by Cicero in the <i>De Nat. Deor</i>., of the tenets of the ancient philosophers, is to be found in Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i>. The English reader is referred to the <i>Metaphysics</i>, book i. pp. 13-46 (Bohn's Classical Library), also to the translator's analysis prefixed to this work, pp, 17-25 See also Diogenes' <i>Lives of the Philosophers</i>, and Tenneman's <i>Manual of Philosophy</i> (translated in Bohn's Library); Plutarch, <i>De Placitis Philosophorum</i>; Lewes' <i>Biographical History of (Ancient) Philolophy</i>; and Rev. Dr. F. D. Maurice's <i>History of (Ancient) Metaphysical and Moral Philosophy</i>. The same subject is discussed in Ritter's <i>History of Philosophy</i> (translated by Morrison).</p>
<p><a name="P272_33628"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>This word is variously given thus: Academian, Academeian, Academaic, Academe, Cademian, and Cadimian. The two last would seem to indicate the character rather than the philosophy of Pyrrho. To favour this view, the text should be altered into <font face="SPIonic">kai adhmoj</font>, i.e., <font face="SPIonic">apodhmoj</font> = from home, not domestic.</p>
<p><a name="P276_34309"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Some hiatus at the beginning of this sentence is apparent.</p>
<p><a name="P277_34702"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>An elaborate defence of this position forms the subject of Cudworth's great work, <i>The True Intellectual System of the Universe</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P278_34873"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This statement has been urged against Origen's authorship, in favour of Epiphinius, who wrote an extended treatise on the <i>Heresies</i>, with an abridgment.</p>

<sup>7 </sup>That is, their esoteric mysteries, intended only for a favoured few, as contrasted with the exoteric. designed for more general diffusion. </p>
<p><a name="P280_35647"></a>

<p><a name="P281_36909"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>"To learn" (Roeper).</p>
<p><a name="P282_37316"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>"And those that are irrational animals do not attempt," (or) "because irrational," etc. The last is Sancroft's reading; that in the text, Roeper's.</p>
<p><a name="P284_37602"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>"Ascend up to" (Roeper).</p>
<p><a name="P285_38497"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>This passage is quoted by those who impugn the authorship of Origen on the ground of his never having been a bishop of the Church. It is not, however, quite certain that the words refer to the episcopal office exclusively.</p>
<p><a name="P286_38817"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>The common reading is in the future, but the present tense is adopted by Richter in his <i>Critical Observations</i>, p. 77.</p>
<p><a name="P287_38982"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>It might be, "any opinion that may be subservient to the subject taken in hand." This is Cruice's rendering in his Latin version. A different reading is, "we must not be silent as regards reasons that hold good," or, "as regards rational distinctions," or, "refrain from utterances through the instrument of reasoning." The last is Roeper's.</p>
<p><a name="P288_39777"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Another reading is, "bringing into a collection."</p>
<p><a name="P289_39972"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>Or, "the Spirit."</p>
<p><a name="P290_40078"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>Or, "indicating a witness; " or, "having adduced testimony,"</p>
<p><a name="P292_40675"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>Or, "a starting-point."</p>
<p><a name="P293_41303"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>Or:, "devoting his attention to; " or, "having lighted upon." </p>
<p><a name="P294_42204"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>The chief writers on the early heresies are: Irenaeus, of the second century; Hippolytus, his pupil, of the third; Philastrius, Epiphanius, and St. Augustine, of the fourth century. The learncd need scarcely be reminded of the comprehensive digest furnished by Ittigius in the preface to his dissertation on the heresies of the apostolic and post-apostolic ages. A book more within the reach of the general reader is Dr. Burton's <i>Inquiry into the Heresies of the Apostolic Age</i>.</p>

<sup>21 </sup>[These were: Periander of Corinth, B.C. 585; Pittacus of Mitylene, B.C. 570; Thales of Miletus, B.C. 548: Solon of Athens, B.C.540; Chilo of Sparta, B.C. 597; Bias of Priene; Cleobulus of Lindus, B.C. 564 ]</p>

<sup>33 </sup>Or, "production."</p>
<p><a name="P315_48253"></a>
<sup>34 </sup>1t should be probably, "monad, number." The monad was with Pythagoras, and in imitation of him with Leibnitz, the highest generalization of number, and a conception in abstraction, commensurate with what we call essence, whether of matter or spirit.</p>

<p><a name="P318_49392"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>Or Thallis, Aethalides, a son of Hermes, was herald of the Argonauts, and said never to have forgotten anything. In this way his soul remembered its successive migrations into the bodies of Euphorbus, Hermotimus, Pyrrhus, and Pythagoras. (See Diogenes' <i>Lives</i>, book viii. chap. i. sec. 4.)</p>
<p><a name="P319_49847"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>No name occurs more frequently in the annals of Greek literature than that of Diodorus. One, however, wiih the title "of Eretria," as far is the translator knows, is mentioned only by Hippolytus; so that this is likely another Diodorus to be added to the long list already cxisting. It may be that Dioclorus Eretriensis is the same as Diodorus Crotnniates, a Pythagorean philospher. See Fabricius' <i>Biblioth. Grac.</i>, lib ii. cap. iii., lib. iii. cap. xxxi.; also Meursius' <i>Annotations</i>, p. 20, <i>on Chalcidius' Commentary on Plato's Timaeus</i>. The article in <i>Smith's Dictionary</i> is a transcript of these.</p>
<p><a name="P320_50465"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>Aristoxenus is mentioned by Cicero in his <i>Tusculan Questions</i>, book i. chap. i. xviii, as having broached a theory in psychology, which may have suggested, in modern times, to David Hartley his hypothesis of sensation being the result of nerval vibrations. Cicero says of Aristoxenus, "that he was so charmed with his own harmonies, that he sought to transfer them into investigations concerning our corporeal and spiritual nature."</p>
<p><a name="P321_50955"></a>
<sup>39 </sup>Zaratas is another form of the name Zoroaster.</p>
<p><a name="P322_51393"></a>
<sup>40 </sup>Or, "is a nature according to musical harmony" (preceding note); or, "The cosmica system is a nature and a musical harmony."</p>
<p><a name="P323_51707"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>Zaras, or Zoroaster, is employed as a sort of generic denomination for philosopher by the Orieintals, who, whatever portions of Asia they inhabit, mostly ascribe their speculative systems try a Zoroaster. No less than six individuals bearing this name are spoken of. Arnobius (<i> Contr. Gentes</i>., i. 52) mentions four-(1) a Chaldean, (2) Bactrian, (3) Pamphylian, (4) Armenian. Pliny mentions a fifth as a native of Proconnesus (<i> Nat. Hist.</i>., xxx. 1), while Apaleius (<i> Florida</i>, ii. 15) a sixth Zoroaster, a native of Babylon, and contemporar with Pythagoras, the one evidently alluded to by Hippolytus. (See translator's <i>Treatise on Metaphisics</i>, chap. ii.)</p>
<p><a name="P324_52633"></a>
<sup>42 </sup>Or, "that it was hot and cold," or "hot of moist."</p>
<p><a name="P325_53023"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>Or it might be rendered, "a process of arrangement." The Abbe Cruice (in his edition of <i>Hippolytus</i>, Paris, 1860) suggests a different reading, which would make the words translate thus, "when the earth was an undigested and solid mass."</p>
<p><a name="P326_53325"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>[See book vi. cap. xxii., <i>infra</i>, and note. But Clement gives another explanation. See vol. ii. p. 385, this series.] </p>

<sup>45 </sup>Or, "Zametus."</p>
<p><a name="P329_55329"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>Or, "leading them down into cells, made them," etc.; or, "made his disciples observe silence," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P335_56167"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>Or, "and beast," more in keeping with the sense of the name; or "a lamb" has been suggested in the Gottingen edition of Hippolytus.</p>
<p><a name="P336_56335"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>Or, "traveller into the sea;" or, "mute ones from the sea;" or, "from the sea a glittering fish."</p>
<p><a name="P338_56580"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>Or, "being the instructor of this (philosopher)."</p>
<p><a name="P342_57177"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>Proclus, in his commentary on Plato's <i>Timaeus</i>, uses almost the same words: "but Heraclitus, in asserting his own universal knowledge, makes out all the rest of mankind ignorant."</p>
<p><a name="P344_58772"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Or, "and among these, Socrates a moral philosopher, and Aristotle a logician, originated systems."</p>
<p><a name="P348_59698"></a>

<p><a name="P349_59913"></a>

<p><a name="P350_59961"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>Or, "congealed snow."</p>
<p><a name="P351_60054"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>That is, Antipodes. Diogenes Laertius was of the opinion that Plato first indicated by name the Antipodes.</p>
<p><a name="P352_60636"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Or, "727 times," is an improbable reading.</p>
<p><a name="P353_60872"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>"In moisture" is properly added, as Plutarch, in his <i>De Placitis</i>, v. xix., remarks that "Anthimander affirms that prinmiary animials were produced in moisture."</p>
<p><a name="P354_61386"></a>

<p><a name="P360_63613"></a>

<sup>62 </sup>[ B.C. 556.]</p>
<p><a name="P365_65061"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>Aristotle considers that Anaxaporas was the first to broach the existence of efficient causes in nature. He states, however, that Hermotimus received the credit of so doing at an earlier date.</p>
<p><a name="P366_65279"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>Or, Hegesephontus. </p>
<p><a name="P367_65666"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>Simplicius, in his <i>Commentary on Aristotle's Physics</i>, where (book i. c. 2) Anaxagoras is spoken of, says that the latter maintained that "all things existed simultaneously-infinite things, and plurality, and diminutiveness, for even what was diminutive was infinite." (See <i>Aristotle's,Metaphysics</i>, iii. 4, Macmahon's translation, p. 93.) This explains Hippolytus' remark, while it suggests an emendation of the text.</p>
<p><a name="P368_67332"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>Or, "in the Antipodes; " or, "from the snow in Aethiopia."</p>
<p><a name="P369_68785"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>Or, "overpowered by the sun," that is, whose light was lost in the superior brilliancy of the sun.</p>
<p><a name="P370_69422"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>Or, "were generated."</p>
<p><a name="P371_69738"></a>

<p><a name="P376_71619"></a>
<sup>71 </sup>Or, "both many of the rest of the animal kingdom, and man himself." (See Diogenes Laertius' <i>Lives</i>, ii. 17.)</p>
<p><a name="P377_72216"></a>
<sup>72 </sup>There is some confusion in the text here, but the rendering given above, though conjectural, is highly probable. One proposed emendation would make the passage run thus: "for that each body employed mind, sometimes slower, sometimes faster."</p>
<p><a name="P382_73274"></a>
<sup>73 </sup>[ B.C. 500]</p>
<p><a name="P383_73686"></a>

<p><a name="P388_74497"></a>

<p><a name="P403_78274"></a>
<sup>82 </sup>Or," Melitus."</p>
<p><a name="P404_78502"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>The textual reading is in the present, but obviously requires a past tense.</p>
<p><a name="P408_78983"></a>
<sup>84 </sup>Some confusion has crept into the text. The first clause of the second sentence belongs probably to the first. The sense would then run thus: "Ecphantus affirmed the impossibility of dogmatic truth, for that every one was permitted to frame definitions as he thought proper."</p>
<p><a name="P409_79467"></a>
<sup>85 </sup>Or, "that there is, according to this, a multitude of defined existences, and that such is infinite."</p>

<sup>88 </sup>Or, "holds."</p>
<p><a name="P420_81051"></a>
<sup>89 </sup>Or, "writing." Still Socrates may be called the father of the Greek philosophy. "From the age of Aristotle and Plato, the rise of the several Greek sects may be estimated as so many successful or abortive efforts to carry out the principles enunciated by Socrates."-<i>Translator's Treatise on Metaphysics</i>, chap. iii. p. 45.</p>
<p><a name="P421_81418"></a>
<sup>90 </sup>This word signifies to take impressions from anything, which justifies the translation, historically correct, given above. Its literal import is "wipe clean," and in this sense Hippolytus may intend to assert that Plato wholly appropriated the philosophy of Socrates. (See Diogenes Laertius, xi. 61, where the same word occurs.) </p>

I have doubts about its correctness, however, and would render it thus: "...enveloped in a body extrinsic to the divine essence, just as if one wore a sheepskin covering; but that his body, on being divested of this (covering), would appear visible to the naked eye." Or, "This discourse whom they name God they affirm to be incorporeal, but enveloped in a body outside himself (or his own body) (just as if one carried a covering of sheepskin to have it seen); but having stripped off the body in which he is enveloped, that he no longer appears visible to the naked eye."

<sup>125 </sup>There are several verbal differences from the original in Hippolytus' version. These may be seen on comparing it with Hesiod's own text. The particular place which Hesiod occupies in the history of philosophy is pointed out by Aristotle in his <i>Metaphysics</i>. The Stagyrite detects in the Hesiodic cosmogony, in the principle of "love," the dawn of a recognition of the necessity of an efficient cause to account for the phenomena of nature. It was Aristotle himself, however, who built up the science of causation; and in this respect humanity owes that extraordinary man a deep debt of gratitude.</p>

Hereby the astrologer alleged his ability of foretelling the future career of the person so born. The most important part of the sky for the astrologer's consideration was that sign of the Zodiac which rose above the horizon at the moment of parturition.

It was employed not only for the measurernent of time, but for making astronomic calculations. Water, as the name imports, was the fluid employed, though mercury has been likewise used.

<sup>32 </sup>This was the great doctrine of astrology, the forerunner of the science of astronomy. Astrology seems to have arisen first among the Chaldeans, out of the fundamental principle of their religion -the assimilation of the divine nature to light. This tenet introduced another, the worship of the stars, which was developed into astrology. Others suppose astrology to have been of Arabian or Egyptian origin. From some of these sources it reached the Greeks, and through them the Romans, who held the astrologic art in high repute. The art, after having become almost extinct, was revived by the Arabians at the verve of the middle ages. For the history of astrology one must consult the writings of Manilius, Julius Firmicus, and Ptolemy. Its greatest medieval apologist is Cardan, the famous physician of Paris (see his work, <i>De Astron. Judic.</i>, lib. vi.-ix. tom. v. of his collected works).</p>

<sup>35 </sup>Aratus, from whom Hippolytus quotes so frequently in this chapter, was a poet and astronomer of antiquity, born at Soli in Cilicia. He afterwards became physician to Gonatus, son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, king of Macedon, at whose court he rose high into favour. The work alluded to by Hippolytus is Aratus' <i>Phaenomena</i>,-a versified account of the motions of the stars, and of sidereal influence over men. This work seems to have been a great favourite with scholars, if we are to judge from the many excellent annotated editions of it that have appeared. Two of these deserve notice, viz., Grotius' Leyden edition, 1600, in Greek and Latin; and Buhle's edition, Leipsic, 1803. See also Dionysius Petavius' Uranoiogion. Arbutus must always be famous, from the fact that St. Paul (Acts xiii. 28) quotes the fifth line of the <i>Phaenomena</i>. Cicero considered Aratus a noble poet, and translated the <i>Phaenimena</i> into Latin, a fragment of which has been preserved, and is in Grotius' edition. Aratus has been translated into English verse, with notes by Dr. Lamb, Dean of Bristol (London: J. W. Parker, 1858).</p>

<sup>36 </sup>The Abbe Cruice suggests "freedom from danger," instead of "cowardice," and translates thus: "whereby kings are slain, by having impunity promised in the predictions of these seers."</p>

<sup>37 </sup>Sextus makes the number "nine thousand nine hundred and seventy and seven years." </p>
<p><a name="P587_134901"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>The parenthetical words are taken from Sextus Empiricus, as introduced into his text by the Abbe Cruice. Schneidewin alludes to the passage in Sextus as proof of some confusion in Hippolytus' text, which he thinks is signified by the transcriber in the words, "I think there is some deficiency or omissions," which occur in the MS. of <i>The Refutation</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P592_136469"></a>
<sup>39 </sup>As regards astological predictions, see Origen's <i>Comment. on Gen</i>.; Diodorus of Tarsus, <i>De Fato</i>; Photii <i>Biblioth</i>., cod, ccxxiii.; and Bardesanis, <i>De Legibus Nationum</i>, in Cureton's <i>Spicilegium Syriacum</i>.</p>

<sup>41 </sup>Schneidewin, on Roeper's suggestion, amends the passage thus, though I am not sure that I exactly render his almost unintelligible Latin version: "For as many sections as there are of eacb, there are educible from the monad more segments than sections; for example, if," etc. The Abbe Cruice would seemingly adopt the following version: "For whatsoever are sections of each, now there are more segments than sections of a monad, will become; for example, if," etc.</p>

<sup>42 </sup>Schneidewin, on mathematical authority, discredits the numerical calculations ascribed to Archimedes. </p>
<p><a name="P597_140670"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>This is manifestly erroneous; the total could only be "four myriads!"</p>
<p><a name="P604_142246"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>The Abbe Cruice thinks that the word should be "tones," supporting his emendation on the authority of Pliny, who states that Pythagoras called the distance of the Moon from the Earth a tone, deriving the term from musical science (see Pliny's <i>Hist. Nat</i>., ii. 20).</p>
<p><a name="P605_142594"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>These numerical speculations are treated of by Archimedes in his work <i>On the Number of the Sand</i>, in which he maintains the possibility of counting the sands, even on the supposition of the world's being much larger than it is (see Archimedes, <font face="SPIonic">ta mexri nun swzomena apanta</font>, Treatise <font face="SPIonic">yammithj</font>, p. 120, ed.

<sup>47 </sup>This word (<font face="SPIonic"> sleoiazousi</font>), more than once used by Hippolytus, is applied to anything done offhand, e.g., an <i>extempore</i> speech. It therefore might be made to designate immaturity of opinion. <font face="SPIonic">Sxedia</font>means something hastily put together, viz., a raft; <font face="SPIonic">sxeoioj</font>, sudden.</p>
<p><a name="P618_149016"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>Schneidewin suggests <font face="SPIonic">omwj</font> instead of <font face="SPIonic">oimoiwj</font>. The word (<font face="SPIonic"> ehanisamenoi</font>) translated "appropriating" is derived from <font face="SPIonic">eranoj</font>, which signifies a meal to which those who partake of it have each contributed some dish (pic-nic). The term, therefore, is an expressive one for Hippolytus' purpose.</p>

Hippolytus, however, used the word <font face="SPIonic">oizhj</font> (translated "school") in a similar way at the end of chap. i. of book iv. "Novelty" is read instead of "knavery;" and for <font face="SPIonic">anapleou</font>, "full," is proposed (1) <font face="SPIonic">anapleontaj</font>, (a) <font face="SPIonic">anapterountaj</font>.</p>

The correction necessary is introduced lower down in the MS., which makes the same characteristic be twice mentioned. The Abbe Cruice, however, accounts for such a twofold mention, on the ground that the whole subject is treated by Hippolytus in such a way as to expose the absurdities of the astrologic predictions.

<sup>129 </sup>The word magic, or magician, at its origin, had no sinister meaning, as being the science professed by the Magi, who were an exclusive religious sect of great antiquity in Persia, universally venerated for their mathematical skill and erudition generally. It was persons who practised wicked arts, and assumed the name of Magi, that brought the term into disrepute. The origin of magic has been ascribed fo Zoroaster, and once devised, it made rapid progress; because, as Pliny reminds us, it includes three systems of the greatest influence among men-(1) the art of medicine, (2) religion, divination. This corresponds with Agrippa's division of magic into (1) natural, (2) celestial, (3) ceremonial, or superstitious. This last has been also called "goetic " (full of imposture), and relates to the invocatioms of devils. This originated probably in Egypt, and quickly spread all over the world.</p>

He makes no attempt at a Latin version.

<p><a name="P837_212402"></a>
<sup>142 </sup>Miller thinks it should be "even number" (<font face="SPIonic"> peritton</font>).

<sup>12 </sup><font face="SPIonic">gnwsij</font>,-a term often alluded to by St. John, and which gives its name "Gnosticism" to the various forms of the Ophitic heresy. The aphorism in the text is one that embodies a grand principle which lies at the root of all correct philosophy. In this and other instances it will be found that the system, however wild and incoherent in its theology, of the Naaseni and of some of the other Gnostic sects, was one which was constructed by a subtle analysis of thought, an by observation of nature.</p>

<sup>13 </sup>The Abbe Cruice remarks on this passage, that, as the statement here as regards Jesus Christ does not correspond with Origen's remarks on the opininns of the Naasseni in reference to our Lord, the <i>Philosophumena</i> cannot be the work of Origen.</p>
<p><a name="P940_247232"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>The Abbe Cruice observes that we have here another proof that the <i>Philosophumena</i> is not the work of Origen, who in his <i>Contra Celsum</i> mentions Mariamne, but professes not to have met with any of his followers (see <i>Contr.

<sup>20 </sup>The Rabbins, probably deriving their notions from the Chaldeans, entertained the most exaggerated ideas respecting the perfection of Adam. Thus Gerson, in his <i>Commentary on Abardanel</i>, says that "Adam was endued with the very perfection of wisdom, and was cheif of philosophers, that he was an immediate disciple of the Deity, also a physician and astrologer, and the originator of all the arts and sciences." This spirit of exaggeration passed from the Jews to the Christians (see <i>Clementine Homilies</i>,ii). Aquinas (<i>Sum. Theol</i>. pars i 94)says of Adam, "Since the first man was appointed perfect, he ought to have posessed a knowledge of everything capable of being ascertained by natural means."</p>

As the latter term is frequently used to designate Eubaea, i.e., the country beyond (<font face="SPIonic"> peran</font>) the continent, it is inferred that Carystius has a simlar import. This would seem placed beyond conjecture by a passage (<i> Strom</i>., vii, vol. ii. p. 555) in Clemens Alexandrinus, already alluded to, who says that some heresies, e.g., those of the Marcionites and Basilidians, derived their denomination from the names, whereas others from the country, of their founders.

<sup>244 </sup>What Hippolytus here states respecting Justinus is quite new. No mention occurs of this heretic in ecclesiastical history. It is evident, however, that, like Simon Magus, he was contemporary with St. Peter and St. Paul. Justinus, however, and the Ophitic sect to which he belonged, are assigned by Hippolytus and Irenaeus a prior position as regards the order of their appearance to the system of Simon, or its offshoot Valentinianism. The Ophites engrafted Phrygian Judaism, and the Valentinians Gentilism, upon Christianity; the former not rejecting the speculations and mysteries of Asiatic paganism, and the latter availing themselves of the cabalistic corruptions of Judaism. The Jndaistic element soon became prominent in successive phases of Valentinianism, which produced a fusion of the sects of the old Gnostics and of Simon. Hippolytus, however, now places the Ophitic sect before us prior to its amalgamation with Valentinianism. Here, for the first time. we have an authentic delineation of the primitive Ophites. This is of great value. [See Irenaeus, vol. i., this series, p. 354; also Bunsen (on Baur), vol. i. p. 42.]</p>

The <i>Recognitions of Clement</i>explain the term thus: "He (Simon) use: this name as implying that he can never be dissolved, asserting that his flesh is so compacted by the power of his divinity, that it can endure to eternity. Hence, there-fore, he is called the <i>standing one</i>, as though he cannot fall by any corruption" (Ante-Nicene Library, vol. iii. p. 196).

<sup>36 </sup>The Abbe Cruice considers that the statements made by Origen (Iontr. Celsum, lib. i. p. 44, ed Spenc.), respecting the followers of Simon in respect of number, militates against Origen's authorship of <i>The Refutation</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P1496_429388"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>This rendering follows the text of Schneidewin and Cruice. The <i>Clementine Recognitions</i>(Ante-Nicene Library, ed. Edinb., vol. iii. p. 273) represent Simon Magus as leaving for Rome, and St. Peter resolving to follow him thither. Miller's text is different and as emended by him, Hippolytus' account would harmonize with that given in the Acts. Miller's text may be thus translated: "And having been laid under a curse, as has been written in the Acts, he subsequently disapproved of his practices, and made an attempt to journey as far as Rome, but he fell in with the apostles," etc. The text or Cruice and Schneidewin seems less forced: while the statement itself-a new witness to this controverted point in ecclesiastical history concerning St. Peter-corroborates Hippolytus' authorship of <i>The Refutation</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P1497_430649"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>Justin Martyr mentions, as an instance of the estimation in which Simon Magus was held among his followers, that a statue was erected to him at Rome. Bunsen considers that the refection of this fable of Justin Martyr's, point to the author of <i>The Refutation</i>being a Roman, who would therefore, as he shows himself in the case of the statue, be better informed than the Eastern writer of any event occurring in the capital of the West. [Bunsen's magisterial decision (p. 53) is very amusingly characteristic.] Hippolytus' silence is a presumption against the existence of such a statue, though it is very possible he might omit to mention it, supposing it to be at Rome. At all events, the jvery precise statement of Justin Martyr ought not to be rejected on slight or confectural grounds. [See vol. i., this series, pp. 171 ,172, 182, 187, and 193. But our author relies on Irenaeus, same vol., p. 348. Why reject positive testimony?] </p>

<sup>39 </sup>Valentinus came from Alexandria to Rome during the pontificate of Hyginus, and established a school there. Hisdesire seems to have been to remain in communion with Rome, which he did for many ye:mrs. as Tertullian informs us. Epiphanius, however, tells that Valentinus. towards the end of his life, when living in Cyprus, separted entirely from the Church.

<sup>40 </sup>These opinions are mostly given in extracts from Valentinus' work <i>Sophia</i>, a book of great repute among Gnostics, and not named by Hippolytus, probably as being so well known at the time. The <i>Gospel of Truth</i>, mentioned by Irenaeus as used among the Valentinians, is not, however, considered to be from the pen of Valentinus. In the extracts given by Hippolytus from Valentinus, it is important (as in the case of Basilides: see translator's introduction) to find that he quotes St. John's Gospel, and St. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. The latter had been pronounced by the Tubingen school as belonging to the period of the Montanistic disputes in the middle of the second century, that is, somewhere about 25-30 years after Valentinus. </p>

<sup>48 </sup>The Abbe Cruice considers that the writer of <i>The Refutation</i>did not agree with Pythagoras' opinion regarding the soul,-a fact that negatives the authorship of Origen, who assented to the Pythagorean psychology. The question concerning the pre-existence of the soul is stated m a passage often quoted, viz., St. Jerome's <i>Letter to Marcellina</i>(Ep. 82).</p>
<p><a name="P1532_444861"></a>

<sup>51 </sup>"Eat not from a stool." This proverb is also differently read and interpreted. Another form is, "Eat not from a chariot," of which the import is variously given, as, Do not tamper with your health, because food swallowed in haste, as it must be when one is driving a team of horses, cannot be salutary or nutritive; or, Do not be careless, because one should attend to the business in hand; if that be guiding a chariot, one should not at the same time try to eat his meals.</p>
<p><a name="P1538_447629"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>The word "entire" Plutarch adds to this proverb. Its ancient form would seem to inculcate patience and courtesy, as if one should not, when at meals, snap at food before others. As read in Plutarch, it has been also interpreted as a precept to avoid creating dissension the unbroken bread being a symbol of unity. It has likewise been explained as an injunction against greediness. The loaf was marked by two intersecting lines into four parts, and one was not to devour ail of these. (See Horace, 1 <i>Epist</i>., xvii. 49.)</p>
<p><a name="P1539_448296"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>This is the generally received import of the proverb. Ancient writers, however, put forward other meanings, connected chiefly with certain effects of beans, e.g., disturbing the mind, and producing melancholy, which Pythagoras is said to have noticed. Horace had no such idea concerning beans (see <i>2 Serm</i>, vi. 63), but evidently alludes to a belief of the magi that disembodied spirits resided in beans. (See Lucian, <i>Micyll</i>: Plutarch, <font face="SPIonic">Peri Paid</font>. <font face="SPIonic">Agwg</font>. 17; Aulus Gellius, iv, 11; and Guigniaut's Cruiser's <font face="SPIonic">Symbolik</font>, i. 160.)

<p><a name="P1541_449446"></a>
<sup>55 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Zaron</font>. This word also signifies "sweepings"or "refuse." Some say it means a Chaldean or Babylonian measure. The meaning would then be: Neglect not giving good measure, i e., practise fair dealing. This agrees with another form of the proverb, reading <font face="SPIonic">zugon</font>for <font face="SPIonic">saron</font>-that is, overlook not the balance or scales.</p>
<p><a name="P1542_449935"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Another meaning assigned to this proverb is, "Labour to no purpose." The palm, it is alleged, when it grows of itself, produces fruit, but sterility ensues upon transplantation. The proverb is also said to mean: Avoid what may seem agreeable, but really is injurious. This alludes to the quality of the wine (see Xenophon's <i>Anab</i>., ii.), which, pleasant in appearance, produced severe headache in those partaking of it. </p>
<p><a name="P1546_452747"></a>

<p><a name="P1550_455272"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>Valentinus' system, if purged of the glosses put upon it by his disciples, appears to have been constructed out of a grand conception of Deity, and evidences much power of abstraction. Between the essence of God, dwelling in the midst of isolation prior to an exercise of the creative energy, and the material worlds, Valentinus interposes an ideal world. Through the latter, the soul-of a kindred nature-is enabled to mount up to God. This is the import of the terms Bythus (depth) and Sige (silence, i.e., solitarness) afterwards used.</p>
<p><a name="P1551_456249"></a>
<sup>59 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kuria</font>: instead of this has been suggested the reading <font face="SPIonic">kai riza</font>, i.e., "which is both the root," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1552_456497"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>In all this. Valentinus intends to delineate the progress from absolute to phenomenal being. There are three developments in this transition. Absolute being (Bythus and Sige) is the same as the eternal thought and consciousness of God's own essence. Here we have the primary emanation, viz., Nous, i.e., Mind (called also Monogenes, only-begotten), and Aletheia, i.e., Truth. Next comes the ideal manifestation through the Logos, i e., Word (obviously borrowed from the prologue to St. John's Gospel), and Zoe, i.e., Life (taken from the same source). We have then the passage from the ideal to the actual in Anthropos, i.e., Man, and Ecclesia, i.e., Church These last are the phenomenal manifestations o( the divine mind.</p>
<p><a name="P1553_457931"></a>
<sup>61 </sup><font face="SPIonic">teleioj</font>: Bunsen would read <font face="SPIonic">teloj</font>, which Cruice objects to on account of the word <font face="SPIonic">teleioteroj</font>occurring in the next sentence. </p>
<p><a name="P1557_458804"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>This follows the text as emended by Bernays.</p>
<p><a name="P1558_459176"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>The number properly should be thirty, as there were two tetrads: (1) Bythus, Sige, Nous, and Aletheia; (2) Logos, Zoe, Ecclesia, and Anthropos. Some, as we learn from Hippolytus, made up the number to thirty, by the addition of Christ and the Holy Ghost,-a fact which Bunsen thinks conclusively proves that the alleged generation of Aeons was a subsequent addition to Valentinus' system.</p>
<p><a name="P1559_459629"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>There is some confusion in Hippolytus' text, which is, however, removeable by a reference to Irenaeus (i. 1).</p>
<p><a name="P1560_459853"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>We subjoin the meanings of these names: -Ten Aeons from Nous and Aletheia, (or) Logo- and Zoe, 1 Bythus = Profundity. 6. Hedone = Voluptuousness. 2 Mixis = Mixture. 7. Acinetus = Motionless. 3. Ageratos = Ever-young. 8. Syncrasis = Composition. 4. Henosis = Unification. 9. Monogenes = Only-begotten. 5. Autophyes = Self-grown. 10. Macaria = Blessedness.</p>
<p><a name="P1561_460494"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>The following are the meanings of these names: -Twelve Nous from Anthropos and Ecclesia, (or) Logos and Zoe: -1. Paracletus = Comforter. 7, Aeinous = Ever-thinking. 2 Pistis= Faith. 8. Synesis = Intelligence. 3 Patricus = Paternal. 19. Ecclesiasticus = Ecclesiastical. 4 Elpis= Hope. 10. Makariotes = Felicity. 5 tletricus = Temperate. 11. Theletus = Volition. 6. Agape = Love. 12.

<p><a name="P1563_461721"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>This Sophia was, so to speak, the bridge which spanned the abyss between God and Reality. Under an aspect of this kind Solomon (Prov. viii.) views Wisdom; and Valentinus introduces it into his system, according to the old Judaistic interpretation of Sophia, as the instrument for God's creative energy. But Sophia thought to pass beyond her function as the connecting link between limited and illimitable existence, by an attempt to evolve the infinite from herself.

<sup>159 </sup>Following Irenaeus, the passage would be rendered thus: "And therefore, on account of its having the remarkable (letter) concomitant with it, they style the dodecade a remarkable passion." Massuet, in his <i>Annotations on Irenaeus</i>, gives the following explanation of the above statement, which is made by Hippolytus likewise. From the twelfth number, by once abstracting the remarkable (number), which does not come into the order and number of the letters, eleven letters remain. Hence in the dodecade, the <font face="SPIonic">paqoj</font>, or what elsewhere the heretics call the "Hysterema," is a defect of one letter. And this is a symbol of the defect or suffering which, upon the withdrawal of one Aeon, happended unto the last dodecade of Aeons.</p>
<p><a name="P1729_527753"></a>
<sup>160 </sup>Hippolytus' statement is less copious and less clear than that of Irenaeus, who explains the defect of the letter to be symbolical of an apostasy of one of the Aeons, and that this one was a female.</p>

<sup>32 </sup>The system of seventy-two nations here adopted by Hippolytus is that advanced by Jewish writers generally, and has been probably deduced from the tenth chapter of Genesis Another historian of the heresies of the Church adopts it-Epiphanius.

<sup>33 </sup>The allusion here made constitutes a strong reason for ascribing <i>The Refutation</i>to Hippolytus, the author of which here states that he had written a <i>Chronicle</i>. But the fragment in our text corresponds with a Latin translation of a <i>Chronicon</i>given by Fabricius, and bearing the name of Hippolytus. The terms in which Hippolytus delivers himself above imply that he was the inventor of a chronological system, thus harmonizing with the fact that the Paschal Cycle, though ever so faulty, was selected out of all his writings for being inscribed on Hippolytus' statue, dug up on the road to Tivoli .a d. 1551, in the vicinity of Rome, near the Church of St. Lorenzo.

<sup>43 </sup>Here we have another reference intimately bearin on the authorship of <i>The Refutation</i>. What follows corresponds with a fragment having a similar title to that stated above, first published by Le Moyne, and inserted in Fabricius (i. pp. 22O - 222) as the work of Hippolytus. Photics mentions this work, and give an extract from it corresponding with what is furnished by Hippolytus. Photius, however, mentions that the book <i>On the Substance of the Universe</i>was said to be written by Josephus, but discovers in marginal notes the asription of it to Caius. But Caius cannot be the writer, since Photius states that the author of <i>The Labyrinth</i>affirmed that he had written <i>0n the Substance of the Universe</i>. Now Hippolytus informs us that he is author of <i>The Labyrinth</i>. Hippolytus thus refers to three of his works in <i>The Refutation</i>: (I) <font face="SPIonic">eterai bibloi</font>, i.e., on Chronology; (2) <i>Concerning the Substance of the Universe</i>; (3) <i>Little Labyrinth</i>. Except Hippolytus and Photics refer to different works in speaking of <i>The Labyrinth</i>, the foregoing settles the question of the authorship of <i>The Refutation</i>.

<sup>64 </sup>This is the reading adopted by Cruice and Bunsen. Dr. Wordsworth translates the passage thus: "acknowledging thyself a man of like nature with Christ, and thou also waiting for the appearance of what thou gavest Him." The source of consolatian to man which Hippolytus, according to Dr. Wordsworth, is here anxious to indicate, is the glorification of human nature in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Dr. Wordsworth therefore objects to Bunsen's rendermg, as it gives to the passage a meaning different from this.</p>

"The worm wriggling as over the filth of the (putrescent) flesh towards the exhaling body" (Roeper). "The worm turning itself towards the substance of the body, towards, (I say,) the exhalations of the decaying frame, as to food" (Schneidewm).

<sup>75 </sup>Hippolytus, by his argument, recognises the duty not merely of overthrowing error but substantiating truth, or in other words, the negative and positive aspect of theology. His brief statement (chap. xxviii.-xxx.) in the latter department, along with being eminently reflective, constitutes a noble specimen of patristic eloquence. [This is most just: and it must be observed, that having summed up his argument against the heresies derived from carnal anil inferior sources, and shown the primal truth, he advances (in chap. xxviii.) to the Nnicene position, and proves himself one of the witnesses on whose traditive testimony that sublime formulary was given to the whole Church as the <font face="SPIonic">kthma ej aei</font>of Christendom,- a formal countersign of apostolic doctrine.] </p>

<sup>52 </sup>Grabe adduces another fragment of the comments of Hippolytus on this passage, found in some leaves deciphered at Rome. It is to tis effect; Plainly and evidently the generation of the Only-begotten, which is at once from God the Father, and through the holy Virgin, is signified, even as He is belived and manifested to be a man. For being by nature and in truth the Son ofgod the Father, on our account He submitted to birth by woman and the womb, and sucked the breast. for He did not, as some fancy, become man only in appearance, but He manifested Himself as in reality that which we are who follow the laws of nature, and supported Himself by food, though Himself giving life to the world.</p>

[Dubious.]9 From this passage it is clear that Hippolytus taught the doctrine of one God alone and three Persons. A little before, in the eighth chapter, he said that there is one God, according to substance or divine essence, which one substance is in three Persons; and that, according to disposition or economy, there are three Persons minifested. By the term <i>economy</i>, therefore, he understands, with Tertullian, <i> adversus Praxcam</i>. ch. iii., the number and disposition of the Trinity (<i> numerum et dispositionem Trinitatis</i>). Here he also calls the grace of the Holy Spirit the <i>third economy</i>, but in the same way as Tertullian, who calls the Holy Spirit the <i>third grade</i> (<i> tertium grandum</i>). For the terms <i> gradus, forma, species, dispositio</i>, and <i> aeconimia</i> mean the same in Tertuliian. (Maranus.)

<sup>271 </sup>Hippolytus thus gives more definite expression to this temporality of the Sonship, as Dorner remarks, than even Tertullian. See Dorner's <i>Doctrine of the Person of Christ</i> (T. &amp; T. Clark), div. i. vol. ii. p. 88, etc. [Pearson <i>On the Creed</i>, art. ii. p. 199 et seqq.

<sup>273 </sup>"<font face="SPIonic">Sustasij</font>," says Dornery "be it observed, is not yet equiva1ent to personality. The sense is, it had its subsistence in the Logos; He was the connective and vehicular force. This is thoroughly unobjectionable. He does not thus necessarily pronounce the humanity of Christ impersonal; although in view of what has preceded, and what remains to be adduced, there can be no doubt [?] that Hippolytus would have defende the impersonality, had the question been agitated at the period at which he lived." See Dorner, as above, i. 95. [But compare Burton, <i>Testimonies of the Ante-Nicene Father</i>, etc., pp. 60-87, where Tertullian and Hippolytus speak for themselves. Note also what he says of the latter, and his variations of expression, p. 87.]</p>

<sup>66 </sup>Or, the theologian. The Apocalypse (xi. 3) mentions only two witnesses, who are understood by the ancients in general as Enoch and Elias. The author of the <i>Chronicon Paschale</i>, p. 21, on Enoch, says: "This is he who, along with Elias, is to withstand Antichrist in the last days, and to confute his deceit, according to the tradition of the Church." This addition as to the return of John the Evangelist is somewhat more uncommon. And yet Ephriem of Antioch, in Photius, cod. ccxxix., states that this too is supported by ancient, ecclesiastical tradition, Christ's saying in John xxi. 22 being understood to that effect.

<sup>7 </sup>This is a very obscure passage, and is variously understood. It seems most probable that the allusion is to Peter's denial of his Lord, and following Him afar off; and is intended to bear upon Cyprian's retirement. There seems no meaning in interpreting the passage a. a reference to Peter's death. [It seems. in a slight degree, to reflect on Cyprian's withdrawal. But note, it asserts that the <i>pasce oves meas</i>was a reproach to St. Peter, and was understood to be so by his fellow-apostles. In other words, our Lord, so these clergy argue, bade St. Peter not again to forsake the brethren whom he should strengthen. Luke xxii. 32.] </p>

<sup>2 </sup>On which subject, again, in chap. 25: "I will not now reconsider what he angrily uttered against Stephen, because there is no necessity for it. The very same things are indeed said which have already been suffciently discussed, and it is better to pass by what suggested the risk of a mischievous dissension. Stephen, for his part, had thought that they who endeavoured to annul the old custom about receiving heretics were to be excommunicated; but the other, moved with the diffculty of that very question, and very largely endowed with a sacred charity, thought that unity might be maintained with them who thought differently. Thus, although there was a great deal of keenness, yet it was always in a spirit of brotherhood; and at length the peace of Christ conquered in their hearts, so that in such a dispute none of the mischief of schism arose between them" (Migne), [Ed. Migne adds, assuming the mediaeval system to have been known to Cyprian, as follows]: "Thus far Augustine, whom we have quoted at length, because the passage is opposed to those who strive from this to assert his schism from the Roman pontiff."</p>

Then he tells them that they need not marvel that heresies nourished, since they had been foretold by Christ; nor that certain Roman confessors acquiesced in the schism, because before one's death no one is blessed, and the traitor Judas was found in the very compnny of the apostles. Yet he charges them to shun the association of schismatics and heretics, and finally exhorts them by the Scriptures to peace and unanimity.</p>

<sup>9 </sup>[Here note that our author's entire ignorance of any Centre of Unity, of any one See as the test of communion; in short, of any one bishop as having more of Peter's authority than others,- is a sufficient disproof of the existence of any such things. Otherwise, how could they have been overlooked in a treatise devoted to the subject of unity, its nature and its <i>criteria</i>? The effort to foist into the text something of the kind, by corruption, demonstrates how entirely unsatesfactory to the Middle-Age theorists and dogmatists is the unadulterated work, which they could not let alone.]</p>

<p><a name="P6942_2240263"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>After this he teaches from the Apostle, and from the third chapter of' Isaiah also, that distinctions of dress and ornaments are more suited to prostitutes than to virgins; and he infers that, while so many things are offensive to God, more especially are the sumptuous ornanients of women; and therefore making a transition from superfluous ornament to the different kinds of dyes and paints, he forbids such things, not only to virgins, but absolutely also to married women, who assuredly cannot with impunity strive to improve, to transfigure, and to adulterate God's work.</p>

<sup>2 </sup>Next, having reproached him with the unaccustomed kinds of tortures with which he tormented the Christians more severely than any other criminals, not for the purpose of making them confess, but of making them deny their faith, he shows the impotence of the gods,-as well because they themselves cannot defend themselves, and so Demetrianus, who pretended to avenge them, should rather be worshipped by them, than himself worship them;-as because, when expelled by Christians from possessed bodies, they themselves confess what they are. Nor indeed must the fall of kings, the destruction of property, and such like evils which accompanied the persecutions of Christians as a punishment from Heaven, be judged not to be punishments, because they were shared by the Christians themselves; inasmuch as all these things are a joy to them rather than a punishment. Accordingly, while there is time, he urges him to return to a better mind, or at least to dread the judgment and an ever burning hery Gehenna, In this tract Cyprian partly imitates Tertullian's <i>Apology</i>and his treatise to Scapula, partly the <i>Octavius</i>of Minucius Felix. </p>

Finally, he tells them that the dead must not be bewailed in such a matter as that we should become a stumblingblock to the Gentiles, as if we were without the hope of a resurrec-tion.

<sup>1 </sup>Having at the outset distinguished true patience from the false patience of philosophers, he commends Christian patience by the patience of God, of Christ, and of all righteous men. He further proves, as well by Scripture as by reason, and, moreover, by the instances of Job and Tobias, that not only is patience useful, but that it is needful also; and in order that the excellence of patience may shine forht the more by contra.it with the vice opposed to it, he sets forth what is the evil of impatience. Finally, he reproves the desire of vengeance, and teaches that revenge ought, according to Scripture, to be left to God rather than to be arrogated to ourselves. If in any writing Cyprian is an imitator of Tertullian, assuredly in this he imitates that writer's treatise <i>On Patience</i>. [See vol. iii. p. 707.]</p>

<sup>22 </sup>An acephalous fragment on the canon of the sacred Scriptures,ascribed by some to Caius. This very important fragment [vol. ii. pp. 4 and 56, this series] was discovered by Muiatori in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, and published by him in his <i>Antiquitates Italicae</i>in 1740. This manuscript belongs to the seventh or eighth century. Muratori ascribed it to Caius, Bunsen to Hegesippus; but there is no clue whatever to the authorship. From internal evidence the writer of the fragment is believed to belong to the latter half of the second century. The fragment has been much discussed. For a full account of it, see Westcott's <i>General Survey of the History of the Canon of the New Testament</i>, 2d ed. p. 184f., and Tregelies' <i>Canon Muratorianus</i>; [also Routh, <i>Rel.</i>, i. pp. 394-434].</p>
<p><a name="P10003_3108034"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>The text is, " quibus tamen interfuit et ita posuit." Westcott omits the " et." Bunsen proposes" ipse non intermit." The reference probably is to the statement of Papias (Euseb., <i>Histor.

<sup>2 </sup>From the ninth chapter to the twenty-eighth he enters upon the dilffuse explanation also of those words of our creed which commend to us faith in the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the Lord our God, the Christ promised in the Old Testament, and proves by the authority of the old and new covenant that He is very man and very God. In chapter eighteenth he refutes the error of the Sabellians, and by the authority of the sacred writings he establishes the distinction of the Father and of the Son, and replies to the objections of the abovenamed heresiarchs and others. In the twenty-ninth chapter he treats of faith in the Holy Spirit, saying that finally the authority of the high admonishes us, after the Father and the Son, to believe also on the Holy Spirit, whose operations he recounts and proves from the Scriptures. He then labours to associate the unity of God with the matters previously contended for, and at length sets forth the sum of the doctrines above explained. [Anthropopathy, see cap. v. p. 615.]</p>
