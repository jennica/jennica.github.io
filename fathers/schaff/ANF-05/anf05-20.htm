<p><i>A discourse</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4088_1270658" id="P4088_1270658" name="P4088_1270658">1</a></sup><i> by the most blessed Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, on the end of the world, and on Antichrist, and on the second coming of our lord Jesus Christ.</i></p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4090_1270915"></a>
<font size="3">I.</font></p>
<p>Since, then, the blessed prophets have been eyes to us, setting forth for our behoof the clear declaration of things secret, both through life, and through declaration, and through inspiration<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4092_1271110" id="P4092_1271110" name="P4092_1271110">2</a></sup> of the Holy Spirit, and discoursing, too, of things not yet come to pass,<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4093_1271201" id="P4093_1271201" name="P4093_1271201">3</a></sup> in this way also<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4094_1271265" id="P4094_1271265" name="P4094_1271265">4</a></sup> to all generations they have pictured forth the grandest subjects for contemplation and for action. Thus, too, they preached of the advent of God<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4095_1271429" id="P4095_1271429" name="P4095_1271429">5</a></sup> in the flesh to the world, His advent by the spotless and God-bearing<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4096_1271548" id="P4096_1271548" name="P4096_1271548">6</a></sup> Mary in the way of birth and growth, and the manner of His life and conversation with men, and His manifestation by baptism, and the new birth that was to be to all men, and the regeneration by the layer; and the multitude of His miracles, and His blessed passion on the cross, and the insults which He bore at the hands of the Jews, and His burial, and His descent to Hades, and His ascent again, and redemption of the spirits that were of old,<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4097_1272478" id="P4097_1272478" name="P4097_1272478">7</a></sup> and the destruction of death, and His life-giving awaking from the dead, and His re-creation of the whole world, and His assumption and return to heaven, and His reception of the Spirit, of which the apostles were deemed worthy, and again the second coming, that is destined to declare all things. For as being designated <i>seers</i>,<sup><a href="footnote/fn40.htm#P4098_1272821" id="P4098_1272821" name="P4098_1272821">8</a></sup> they of necessity signified and spake of these things beforetime.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4100_1272900"></a>
<font size="3">II.</font></p>
<p>Hence, too, they indicated the day of the consummation to us, and signified beforehand the day of the apostate that is to appear and deceive men at the last times, and the beginning and end of his kingdom, and the advent of the Judge, and the life of the righteous, and the punishment of the sinners, in order that we all, bearing these things in mind day by day and hour by hour, as children of the Church, might know that "not one jot nor one tittle of these things shall fail,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4102_1273384" id="P4102_1273384" name="P4102_1273384">9</a></sup> as the Saviour's own word announced. Let all of you, then, of necessity, open the eyes of your hearts and the ears of your soul, and receive the word which we are about to speak. For I shall unfold to you to-day a narration full of horror and fear, to wit, the account of the consummation, and in particular, of the seduction of the whole world by the enemy and devil; and after these things, the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4104_1273837"></a>
<font size="3">III.</font></p>
<p>Where, then, ye friends of Christ, shall I begin? and with what shall I make my commencement, or what shall I expound? and what witness shall I adduce for the things spoken? But let us take those (viz., the prophets) with whom we began this discourse, and adduce them as credible witnesses, to confirm our exposition of the matters discussed; and after them the teaching, or rather the prophecy, of the apostles, (so as to see) how throughout the whole world they herald the day of the consummation. Since these, then, have also shown beforetime things not vet come to pass, and have declared the devices and deceits of wicked men, who are destined to be made manifest, come and let us bring forward Isaiah as our first witness, inasmuch as he instructs us in the times of the consummation. What, then, does he say? "Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence: the daughter of Zion shall be left as a cottage in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4106_1274893" id="P4106_1274893" name="P4106_1274893">10</a></sup> You see, beloved, the prophet's illumination, whereby he announced that time so many generations before. For it is not of the Jews that he spake this word of old, nor of the city of Zion, but of the Church. For all the prophets have declared Sion to be the bride brought from the nations.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4108_1275196"></a>
<font size="3">IV.</font></p>
<p>Wherefore let us direct our discourse to a second witness. And of what sort is this one? Listen to Osea, as he speaks thus grandly: "In those days the Lord shall bring on a burning wind from the desert against them, and shall make their veins dry, and shall make their springs desolate; and all their goodly vessels shall be spoiled. Because they rose up against God, they shall fall by the sword, and their women with child shall be ripped up."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4110_1275646" id="P4110_1275646" name="P4110_1275646">11</a></sup> And what else is this burning wind from the east, than the Antichrist that is to destroy and dry up the veins of the waters and the fruits of the trees in his times, because men set their hearts on his works? For which reason he shall indeed destroy them, and they shall serve him in his pollution.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4112_1275963"></a>
<font size="3">V.</font></p>
<p>Mark the agreement of prophet with prophet. Acquaint yourself also with another prophet who expresses himself in like manner. For Amos prophesied of the same things in a manner quite in accordance: "Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch therefore as ye have beaten the poor with the fist,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4114_1276248" id="P4114_1276248" name="P4114_1276248">12</a></sup> and taken choice gifts from him: ye have built houses, but ye shall not dwell in them: ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. For I know your manifold transgressions, in trampling justice beneath your foot, and taking a bribe, and turning aside the poor in the gate from their right. Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4115_1276713" id="P4115_1276713" name="P4115_1276713">13</a></sup> Learn, beloved, the wickedness of the men of that time, how they spoil houses and fields, and take even justice from the just; for when these things come to pass, ye may know that it is the end. For this reason art thou instructed in the wisdom of the prophet, and the revelation that is to be in those days. And all the prophets, as we bare already said, have clearly signified the things that are to come to pass in the last times, just as they also have declared things of old.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4117_1277217"></a>
<font size="3">VI.</font></p>
<p>But not to expend our argument entirely in going over the words of all the prophets,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4119_1277306" id="P4119_1277306" name="P4119_1277306">14</a></sup> after citing one other, let us revert to the matter in hand. What is it, then, that Micah says in his prophecy? "Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry to him, Peace; and if it was not put into their mouth,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4120_1277713" id="P4120_1277713" name="P4120_1277713">15</a></sup> they prepared<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4121_1277808" id="P4121_1277808" name="P4121_1277808">16</a></sup> war against him. Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision;<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4122_1277974" id="P4122_1277974" name="P4122_1277974">17</a></sup> and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall not go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4123_1278196" id="P4123_1278196" name="P4123_1278196">18</a></sup> These things we have recounted beforehand, in order that ye may know the pain that is to be in the last times, and the perturbation, and the manner of life on the part of all men toward each other,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4124_1278414" id="P4124_1278414" name="P4124_1278414">19</a></sup> and their envy, and hate, and strife, and the negligence of the shepherds toward the sheep, and the unruly disposition of the people toward the priests.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4125_1278644" id="P4125_1278644" name="P4125_1278644">20</a></sup> </p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4127_1278875"></a>
<font size="3">VII.</font></p>
<p>Wherefore all shall walk after their own will. And the children will lay hands on their parents. The wife will give up her own husband to death, and the husband will bring his own wife to judgment like a criminal. Masters will lord it over their servants savagely,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4129_1279145" id="P4129_1279145" name="P4129_1279145">21</a></sup> and servants will assume an unruly demeanour toward their masters. None will reverence the grey hairs of the elderly, and none will have pity upon the comeliness of the youthful. The temples of God will be like houses, and there will be overturnings of the churches everywhere.The Scriptures will be despised, and everywhere they will sing the songs of the adversary.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4130_1279621" id="P4130_1279621" name="P4130_1279621">22</a></sup> Fornications, and adulteries, and perjuries will fill the land; sorceries, and incantations, and divinations will follow after I these with all force and zeal. And, on the whole, from among those who profess to be Christians will rise up then false prophets, false apostles, impostors, mischief-makers, evil-doers, liars against each other, adulterers, fornicators, robbers, grasping, perjured, mendacious, hating each other. The shepherds will be like wolves; the priests will embrace falsehood; the monks<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4131_1280182" id="P4131_1280182" name="P4131_1280182">23</a></sup> will lust after the things of the world; the rich will assume hardness of heart; the rulers will not help the poor; the powerful will cast off all pity; the judges will remove justice from the just, and, blinded with bribes, they will call in unrighteousness.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4133_1280493"></a>
<font size="3">VIII.</font></p>
<p>And what am I to say with respect to men,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4135_1280541" id="P4135_1280541" name="P4135_1280541">24</a></sup> when the very elements themselves will disown their order? There will be earthquakes in every city, and plagues in every country; and monstrous<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4136_1280763" id="P4136_1280763" name="P4136_1280763">25</a></sup> thunderings and frightful lightnings will burn up both houses and fields. Storms of winds will disturb both sea and land excessively; and there will be unfruitfulness on the earth, and a roaring in the sea, and an intolerable agitation on account of souls and the destruction of men.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4137_1281103" id="P4137_1281103" name="P4137_1281103">26</a></sup> There will be signs in the sun, and signs in the moon, deflections in the stars, distresses of nations, intemperateness in the atmosphere, discharges of hail upon the face of the earth, winters of excessive severity, different<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4138_1281512" id="P4138_1281512" name="P4138_1281512">27</a></sup> frosts, inexorable scorching winds, unexpected thunderings, unlooked-for conflagrations; and in general, lamentation and mourning in the whole earth, without consolation. For, "because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4139_1281874" id="P4139_1281874" name="P4139_1281874">28</a></sup> By reason of the agitation and confusion of all these, the Lord of the universe cries in the Gospel, saying, "Take heed that ye be not deceived; for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not yet by and by."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4140_1282293" id="P4140_1282293" name="P4140_1282293">29</a></sup> Let us observe the word of the Saviour, how He always admonished us with a view to our security: "Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ."</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4142_1282499"></a>
<font size="3">IX.</font></p>
<p>Now after He was taken up again to the Father, there arose some, saying, "I am Christ," like Simon Magus and the rest, whose names we have not time at present to mention. Wherefore also in the last day of the consummation, it must needs be that false Christs will arise again, saying, "I am Christ," and they will deceive many. And multitudes of men will run from the east even to the west, and from the north even to the sea, saying, Where is Christ here? where is Christ there? But being possessed of a vain conceit, and failing to read the Scriptures carefully, and not being of an upright mind, they will seek for a name which they shall be unable to find. For these things must first be; and thus the son of perdition-that is to say, the devil-must be seen.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4145_1283264"></a>

<p>And the apostles, who speak of God,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4147_1283303" id="P4147_1283303" name="P4147_1283303">30</a></sup> in establishing the truth of the advent of the Lord Jesus Christ, have each of them indicated the appearing of these abominable and ruin-working men, and have openly announced their lawless deeds. First of all Peter, the rock of the faith, whom Christ our God called blessed, the teacher of the Church, the first disciple, he who has the keys of the kingdom, has instructed us to this effect: "Know this first, children, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4148_1283844" id="P4148_1283844" name="P4148_1283844">31</a></sup> And there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4149_1283956" id="P4149_1283956" name="P4149_1283956">32</a></sup> After him, John the theologian,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4150_1284007" id="P4150_1284007" name="P4150_1284007">33</a></sup> and the beloved of Christ, in harmony with him, cries, "The children of the devil are manifest;<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4151_1284118" id="P4151_1284118" name="P4151_1284118">34</a></sup> and even now are there many antichrists;<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4152_1284180" id="P4152_1284180" name="P4152_1284180">35</a></sup> but go not after them.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4153_1284223" id="P4153_1284223" name="P4153_1284223">36</a></sup> Believe not every spirit, because many false prophets are gone out into the world."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4154_1284325" id="P4154_1284325" name="P4154_1284325">37</a></sup> And then Jude, the brother of James, speaks in like manner: "In the last times there shall be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts. There be they who, without fear, feed<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4155_1284524" id="P4155_1284524" name="P4155_1284524">38</a></sup> themselves."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4156_1284624" id="P4156_1284624" name="P4156_1284624">39</a></sup> You have observed the concord of the theologians and apostles, and the harmony of their doctrine.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4158_1284738"></a>
<font size="3">XI.</font></p>
<p>Finally, hear Paul as he speaks boldly, and mark how clearly he discovers these: "Beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4160_1284873" id="P4160_1284873" name="P4160_1284873">40</a></sup> Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit.<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4161_1284958" id="P4161_1284958" name="P4161_1284958">41</a></sup> See that ye walk circumspectly, because the days are evil."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4162_1285035" id="P4162_1285035" name="P4162_1285035">42</a></sup> In fine then, what man shall have any excuse who hears these things in the Church from prophets and apostles, and from the Lord Himself, and yet will give no heed to the care of his soul, and to the time of the consummation, and to that approaching hour when we shall have to stand at the judgment-seat of Christ?</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4164_1285369"></a>
<font size="3">XII.</font></p>
<p>But having now done with this account of the consummation, we shall turn our exposition to those matters which fall to be stated by us next in order. I adduce, therefore, a witness altogether worthy of credit,-namely, the prophet Daniel, who interpreted the vision of Nabuchodonosor, and from the beginning of the kings down to their end indicated the right<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4166_1285732" id="P4166_1285732" name="P4166_1285732">43</a></sup> way to those who seek to walk therein-to wit, the manifestation of the truth. For what saith the prophet? He presignified the matter clearly to Nabuchodonosor in the following terms: "Thou. O king, sawest, and behold a great image standing before thee, whose head was of gold, its arms anti shoulders of silver, its belly and thighs of brass, its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay. Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hand; and it smote the image upon its feet, which were part of iron and part of clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the clay, and the iron, and the brass, and the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floor; and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4167_1286578" id="P4167_1286578" name="P4167_1286578">44</a></sup> </p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4169_1286598"></a>
<font size="3">XIII.</font></p>
<p>Wherefore, bringing the visions of Daniel into conjunction with these, we shall make one narrative of the two, and show how true and consistent were the things seen in vision by the prophet with those which Nabuchodonosor saw beforehand. For the prophet speaks thus: "I Daniel saw, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another. The first was like a lioness, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given it. And behold a second beast, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh. After this I beheld, and lo a third beast, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl: the beast had also four heads. After this I saw, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; its great iron teeth and its claws of brass<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4171_1287710" id="P4171_1287710" name="P4171_1287710">45</a></sup> devoured and brake in pieces, and it stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse exceedingly from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns. I considered its horns, and, behold, there came up among them a little horn, and before it there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4172_1288235" id="P4172_1288235" name="P4172_1288235">46</a></sup> </p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4174_1288254"></a>
<font size="3">XIV.</font></p>
<p>Now, since these things which are thus spoken mystically by the prophet seem to all to be hard to understand, we shall conceal none of them from those who are possessed of sound mind. By mentioning the first beast, namely the <i>lioness</i> that comes up out of the sea, Daniel means the kingdom of the Babylonians which was set up in the world; and that same is also the "golden head" of this image. And by speaking of its "wings like an eagle," he shows that king Nabuchodonosor was elevated and exalted himself against God. Then he says that its "wings were plucked out," and means by this that his glory was subverted: for he was driven from his kingdom. And in stating that a "man's heart was given it, and it was made stand upon the feet like a man," he means that he repented, and acknowledged that he was himself but a man, and gave the glory to God. Lo, I have thus unfolded the similitude of the first beast.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4177_1289169"></a>
<font size="3">XV.</font></p>
<p>Then after the lioness, the prophet sees a second beast like a bear, which denoted the Persians; for after the Babylonians the Persians had the sovereignty. And in saying, "I saw three ribs in the mouth of it," he referred to three nations, the Persians, Medes, and Babylonians, which were also expressed by the silver that came after the gold in the image. Behold, we have explained the second beast too. Then the third was the leopard, by which were meant the Greeks. For after the Persians, Alexander king of the Macedonians held the sovereignty, when he had destroyed Darius; and this is expressed by the brass in the image. And in speaking of "four wings of a fowl, and four heads in the beast," he showed most clearly how the kingdom of Alexander was divided into four parts. For it had four heads,-namely, the four kings that rose out of it. For on his death-bed<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4179_1290043" id="P4179_1290043" name="P4179_1290043">47</a></sup> Alexander divided his kingdom into four parts. Behold, we have discussed the third also. </p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4181_1290192"></a>
<font size="3">XVI.</font></p>
<p>Next he tells us of the "fourth beast, dreadful and terrible; its teeth were of iron, and its claws of brass." And what is meant by these but the kingdom of the Romans, which also is meant by the iron, by which it will crush all the seats of empire that were before it, and will lord it over the whole earth? After this, then, what is left for us to interpret of all that the prophet saw, but the "toes of the image, in which part was of iron and part of clay, mingled together in one? "For by the ten toes of the image he meant figuratively the ten kings who sprang out of it, as Daniel also interpreted the matter. For he says, "I considered the beast, namely the fourth; and behold ten horns after it, among which another horn arose like an offshoot; and it will pluck up by the root three of those before it." And by this offshoot horn none other is signified than the Antichrist that is to restore the kingdom of the Jews. And the three horns which are to be rooted out by it signify three kings, namely those of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia, whom he will destroy in the array of war; <i>and</i> when he has vanquished them all, being a savage tyrant, he will raise tribulation and persecution against the saints, exalting himself against them.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4184_1291436"></a>
<font size="3">XVII.</font></p>
<p>You see how Daniel interpreted to Nabuchodonosor the dominion of the kingdoms; you see how he explained the form of the image in all its parts;<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4186_1291586" id="P4186_1291586" name="P4186_1291586">48</a></sup> you have observed how he indicated prophetically the meaning of the coming up of the four beasts out of the sea. It remains that we open up to you the things done by the Antichrist in particular; and, as far as in our power, declare to you by means of the Scriptures and the prophets, his wandering over the whole earth, and his lawless advent.</p>

<p>As the Lord Jesus Christ made His sojourn with us in the flesh (which He received) from the holy, immaculate Virgin, and took to Himself the tribe of Judah, and came forth from it, the Scripture declared His royal lineage in the word of Jacob, when in his benediction he addressed himself to his son in these terms: "Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hands shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion's whelp; from a sprout,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4190_1292467" id="P4190_1292467" name="P4190_1292467">49</a></sup> my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lion's whelp:<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4191_1292569" id="P4191_1292569" name="P4191_1292569">50</a></sup> who shall rouse him up? A ruler<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4192_1292615" id="P4192_1292615" name="P4192_1292615">51</a></sup> shall not depart from Judah, nor a leader<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4193_1292669" id="P4193_1292669" name="P4193_1292669">52</a></sup> from his thighs,<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4194_1292702" id="P4194_1292702" name="P4194_1292702">53</a></sup> until what is in store for him<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4195_1292752" id="P4195_1292752" name="P4195_1292752">54</a></sup> shall come, and he is the expectation<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4196_1292810" id="P4196_1292810" name="P4196_1292810">55</a></sup> of the nations."<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4197_1292853" id="P4197_1292853" name="P4197_1292853">56</a></sup> Mark these words of Jacob which were spoken to Judah, and are fulfilled in the Lord. To the same effect, moreover, does the patriarch express himself regarding Antichrist. Wherefore, as he prophesied with respect to Judah, so did he also with respect to his son Dan. For Judah was his fourth son; and Dan, again, was his seventh son. And what, then, did he say of him? "Let Dan be a serpent sitting by the way, that biteth the horse's heel? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4198_1293318" id="P4198_1293318" name="P4198_1293318">57</a></sup> And what serpent was there but the deceiver from the beginning, he who is named in Genesis, he who deceived Eve, and bruised Adam in the heel?<sup><a href="footnote/fn41.htm#P4199_1293481" id="P4199_1293481" name="P4199_1293481">58</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">XIX.</font></p>
<p>But seeing now that we must make proof of what is alleged at greater length, we shall not shrink from the task. For it is certain that he is destined to spring from the tribe of Dan,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4203_1293684" id="P4203_1293684" name="P4203_1293684">59</a></sup> and to range himself in opposition like a princely tyrant, a terrible judge and accuser,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4204_1293934" id="P4204_1293934" name="P4204_1293934">60</a></sup> as the prophet testifies when he says, "Dan shall judge his people, as one tribe in Israel."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4205_1294042" id="P4205_1294042" name="P4205_1294042">61</a></sup> But some one may say that this was meant of Samson, who sprang from the tribe of Dan, and judged his people for twenty years. That, however, was only partially made good in the case of Samson; but this shall be fulfilled completely in the case of Antichrist. For Jeremiah, too, speaks in this manner: "From Dan we shall hear the sound of the sharpness<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4206_1294414" id="P4206_1294414" name="P4206_1294414">62</a></sup> of his horses; at the sound of the neighing<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4207_1294522" id="P4207_1294522" name="P4207_1294522">63</a></sup> of his horses the whole land trembled."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4208_1294603" id="P4208_1294603" name="P4208_1294603">64</a></sup> And again, Moses says: "Dan is a lion's whelp, and he shall leap from Bashan."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4209_1294702" id="P4209_1294702" name="P4209_1294702">65</a></sup> And that no one may fall into the mistake of thinking that this is spoken of the Saviour, let him attend to this. "Dan," says he, "is a lion's whelp; "and by thus naming the tribe of Dan as the one whence the accuser is destined to spring, he made the matter in hand quite clear. For as Christ is born of the tribe of Judah, so Antichrist shall be born of the tribe of Dan. And as our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was spoken of in prophecy as a <i>lion</i> on account or His royalty and glory, in the same manner also has the Scripture prophetically described the accuser as a lion, on account of his tyranny and violence.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4211_1295358"></a>
<font size="3">XX.</font></p>
<p>For in every respect that deceiver seeks to make himself appear like the Son of God. Christ is a lion, and Antichrist is a lion. Christ is King of things celestial and things terrestrial, and Antichrist will be king upon earth. The Saviour was manifested as a lamb; and he, too, will appear as a lamb, while he is a wolf within. The Saviour was circumcised, and he in like manner will appear in circumcision. The Saviour sent the apostles unto all the nations, and he in like manner will send false apostles. Christ gathered together the dispersed sheep, and he in like manner will gather together the dispersed people of the Hebrews. Christ gave to those who believed on Him the honourable and life-giving cross, and he in like manner will give his own sign. Christ appeared in the form of man, and he in like manner will come forth in the form of man. Christ arose from among the Hebrews, and he will spring from among the Jews. Christ displayed His flesh like a temple, and raised it up on the third day; and he too will raise up again the temple of stone in Jerusalem. And these deceits fabricated by him will become quite intelligible to those who listen to us attentively, from what shall be set forth next in order.</p>

<p>For through the Scriptures we are instructed in two advents of the Christ and Saviour. And the first after the flesh was in humiliation, because He was manifested in lowly estate. So then His second advent is declared to be in glory; for He comes from heaven with power, and angels, and the glory of His Father. His first advent had John the Baptist as its forerun-her; and His second, in which He is to come in glory, will exhibit Enoch, and Elias, and John the Divine.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4216_1297059" id="P4216_1297059" name="P4216_1297059">66</a></sup> Behold, too, the Lord's kindness to man; how even in the last times He shows His care for mortals, and pities them. For He will not leave us even then without prophets, but will send them to us for our instruction and assurance, and to make us give heed to the advent of the adversary, as He intimated also of old in this Daniel. For he says, "I shall make a covenant of one week, and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and libation will be removed." For by one week he indicates the showing forth of the seven years which shall be in the last times.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4217_1298358" id="P4217_1298358" name="P4217_1298358">67</a></sup> And the half of the week the two prophets, along with John, will take for the purpose of proclaiming to all the world the advent of Antichrist, that is to say, for a "thousand two hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4218_1298706" id="P4218_1298706" name="P4218_1298706">68</a></sup> and they will work signs and wonders with the object of making men ashamed and repentant, even by these means, on account of their surpassing lawlessness and impiety. "And if any man will hurt them, fire will proceed out of their mouth, and devour their enemies. These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of the advent of Antichrist, and to turn waters into blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4219_1299172" id="P4219_1299172" name="P4219_1299172">69</a></sup> And when they have proclaimed all these things they will fall on the sword, cut off by the accuser<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4220_1299327" id="P4220_1299327" name="P4220_1299327">70</a></sup> . And they will fulfil their testimony, as Daniel also says; for he foresaw that the beast that came up out of the abyss would make war with them, namely with Enoch, Elias, and John, and would overcome them, and kill them, because of their refusal to give glory to the accuser. that is the little horn that sprang up.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4221_1299694" id="P4221_1299694" name="P4221_1299694">71</a></sup> And he, being lifted up in heart, begins in the end to, exalt himself and glorify himself as God, persecuting the saints and blaspheming Christ.</p>

<font size="3">XXII.</font></p>
<p>But as, in accordance with the train of our discussion, we have been constrained to come to the matter of the days of the dominion of the adversary, it is necessary to state in the first place what concerns his nativity and growth; and then we must turn our discourse, as we have said before, to the expounding of this matter, viz., that in all respects the accuser and son of lawlessness<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4225_1300273" id="P4225_1300273" name="P4225_1300273">72</a></sup> is to make himself like our Saviour. Thus also the demonstration makes the matter clear to us. Since the Saviour of the world, with the purpose of saving the race of men, was born of the immaculate and virgin Mary,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4226_1300609" id="P4226_1300609" name="P4226_1300609">73</a></sup> and in the form of the flesh trod the enemy trader foot, in the exercise of the power of His own proper divinity; in the same manner also will the accuser come forth from an impure woman upon the earth, but shall be born of a virgin spuriously.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4227_1300899" id="P4227_1300899" name="P4227_1300899">74</a></sup> For our God sojourned with us in the flesh, after that very flesh of ours which He made for Adam and all Adam's posterity, yet without sin. But the accuser, though he take up the flesh, will do it only in appearance; for how should we wear that flesh which he did not make himself, but against which he warreth daily? And it is my opinion, beloved, that he will assume this phenomenal kind of flesh<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4228_1301507" id="P4228_1301507" name="P4228_1301507">75</a></sup> as an instrument.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4229_1301567" id="P4229_1301567" name="P4229_1301567">76</a></sup> For this reason also is he <i>to be</i> born of a virgin, as if a spirit, and then to the rest he will be manifested as flesh. For as to a virgin bearing, this we have known only in the case of the all-holy <i>Virgin</i>, who bore the Saviour verily clothed in flesh.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4230_1301842" id="P4230_1301842" name="P4230_1301842">77</a></sup> For Moses says, "Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy unto the Lord."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4231_1302063" id="P4231_1302063" name="P4231_1302063">78</a></sup> This is by no means the case with him;<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4232_1302150" id="P4232_1302150" name="P4232_1302150">79</a></sup> but as the adversary will not open the womb, so neither will he take to himself real flesh, and be circumcised as Christ was circumcised. And even as Christ chose His apostles, so will he too assume a whole people of disciples like himself in wickedness.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4234_1302424"></a>
<font size="3">XXIII.</font></p>
<p>Above all, moreover, he will love the nation of the Jews. And with all these he will work signs and terrible wonders, false wonders and not true, in order to deceive his impious equals. For if it were possible, he would seduce even the elect<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4236_1302673" id="P4236_1302673" name="P4236_1302673">80</a></sup> from the love of Christ. But in his first steps he will be gentle, loveable, quiet, pious, pacific, hating injustice, detesting gifts, not allowing idolatry; loving, says he, the Scriptures, reverencing priests, honouring his elders, repudiating fornication, detesting adultery, giving no heed to slanders, not admitting oaths, kind to strangers, kind to the poor, compassionate. And then he will work wonders, cleansing lepers, raising paralytics, expelling demons, proclaiming things remote just as things present, raising the dead, helping widows, defending orphans, loving all, reconciling in love men who contend, and saying to such, "Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4237_1303377" id="P4237_1303377" name="P4237_1303377">81</a></sup> and he will not acquire gold, nor love silver, nor seek riches.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="P4239_1303457"></a>
<font size="3">XXIV.</font></p>
<p>And all this he will do corruptly and deceitfully, and with the purpose of deluding all to make him king. For when the peoples and tribes see so great virtues and so great powers in him, they will all with one mind meet together to make him king. And above all others shall the nation of the Hebrews be dear to the tyrant himself, while they say one to another, Is there found indeed in our generation such a man, so good and just? That shall be the way with the race of the Jews pre-eminently, as I said before, who, thinking, as they do, that they shall behold the king himself in such power, will approach him to say, We all confide in thee, and acknowledge thee to be just upon the whole earth; we all hope to be saved by thee; and by thy mouth we have received just and incorruptible judgment.</p>

<p>And at first, indeed, that deceitful and lawless one, with crafty deceitfulness, will refuse such glory; but the men persisting, and holding by him, will declare him king. And thereafter he will be lifted up in heart, and he who was formerly gentle will become violent, and he who pursued love will become pitiless, and the humble in heart will become haughty and inhuman, and the hater of unrighteousness will persecute the righteous. Then, when he is elevated to his kingdom, he will marshal war; and in his wrath he will smite three mighty kings,-those, namely, of Egypt, Libya, and Ethiopia. And after that he will build the temple in Jerusalem, and will restore it again speedily, and give it over to the Jews. And then he will be lifted up in heart against every man; yea, he will speak blasphemy also against God, thinking in his deceit that he shall be king upon the earth hereafter for ever; not knowing, miserable wretch, that his kingdom is to be quickly brought to nought, and that he will quickly have to meet the fire which is prepared for him, along with all who trust him and serve him. For when Daniel said, "I shall make my covenant for one week,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4244_1305431" id="P4244_1305431" name="P4244_1305431">82</a></sup> he indicated seven years; and the one half of the week is for the preaching of the prophets, and for the other half of the week-that is to say, for three years and a half-Antichrist will reign upon the earth. And after this his kingdom and his glory shall be taken away. Behold, ye who love God, what manner of tribulation there shall rise in those days, such as has not been from the foundation of the world, no, nor ever shall be, except in those days alone. Then the lawless one, being lifted up in heart, will gather together his demons in man's form, and will abominate those who call him to the kingdom, and will pollute many souls. </p>

<p>For he will appoint princes over them from among the demons. And he will no longer seem to be pious, but altogether and in all things he will be harsh, severe, passionate, wrathful, terrible, inconstant, dread, morose, hateful, abominable, savage, vengeful, iniquitous. And, bent on casting the whole race of men into the pit of perdition, he will multiply false signs. For when all the people greet him with their acclamations at his displays, he will shout with a strong voice, so that the place shall be shaken in which the multitudes stand by him: "Ye peoples, and tribes, and nations, acquaint yourselves with my mighty authority and power, and the strength of my kingdom. What prince is there so great as I am? What great God is there but I? Who will stand up against my authority? "Under the eye of the spectators he will remove mountains from their places, he will walk on the sea with dry feet, he will bring down fire from heaven, he will turn the day into darkness and the night into day, he will turn the sun about wheresoever he pleases; and, in short, in presence of those who behold him, he will show all the elements of earth and sea to be subject to him in the power of his specious manifestation. For if, while as yet he does not exhibit himself as the son of perdition, he raises and excites against us open war even to battles and slaughters, at that time when he shall come in his own proper person, and men shall see him as he is in reality, what machinations and deceits and delusions will he not bring into play, with the purpose of seducing all men, and leading them off from the way of truth, and from the gate of the kingdom?</p>

<p>Then, after all these things, the heavens will not give their dew, the clouds will not give their rain, the earth will refuse to yield its fruits, the sea shall be filled with stench, the rivers shall be dried up, the fish of the sea shall die, men shall perish of hunger and thirst; and father embracing son, and mother embracing daughter, will die together, and there will be none to bury them. But the whole earth will be filled with the stench arising from the dead bodies cast forth. And the sea, not receiving the floods of the rivers, will become like mire, and will be filled with an unlimited smell and stench. Then there will be a mighty pestilence upon the whole earth, and then, too, inconsolable lamentation, and measureless weeping, and unceasing mourning Then men will deem those happy who are dead before them, and will say to them, "Open your sepulchres, and take us miserable beings in; open your receptacles for the reception of your wretched kinsmen and acquaintances. Happy are ye, in that ye have not seen our days. Happy are ye, in that ye have not had to witness this painful life of ours, nor this irremediable pestilence, nor these straits that possess our souls."</p>

<p>Then that abominable one will send his commands throughout every government by the hand at once of demons and of visible men, who shall say, "A mighty king has arisen upon the earth; come ye all to worship him; come ye all to see the strength of his kingdom: for, behold, he will give you corn; and he will bestow upon you wine, and great riches, and lofty honours. For the whole earth and sea obeys his command. Come ye all to him." And by reason of the scarcity of food, all will go to him and worship him; and he will put his mark on their right hand and on their forehead, that no one may put the sign of the honourable cross upon his forehead with his right hand; but his hand is bound. And from that time he shall not have power to seal any one of his members, but he shall be attached to the deceiver, and shall serve him; and in him there is no repentance. But such an one is lost at once to God and to men, and the deceiver will give them scanty food by reason of his abominable seal. And his seal upon the forehead and upon the right hand is the number, "Six hundred threescore and six."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4254_1310175" id="P4254_1310175" name="P4254_1310175">83</a></sup> And I have an opinion as to this number, though I do not know the matter for certain; for many names have been found in this number when it is expressed in writing.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4255_1310361" id="P4255_1310361" name="P4255_1310361">84</a></sup> Still we say that perhaps the scription of this same seal will give us the word <i>I deny</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4256_1310467" id="P4256_1310467" name="P4256_1310467">85</a></sup> For even in recent days, by means of his ministers-that is to say, the idolaters-that bitter adversary took up the word <i>deny</i>, when the lawless pressed upon the witnesses of Christ, with the adjuration, "Deny thy God, the crucified One."<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4257_1310880" id="P4257_1310880" name="P4257_1310880">86</a></sup> </p>

<p>Of such kind, in the time of that hater of all good, will be the seal, the tenor of which will be this: I deny the Maker of heaven and earth, I deny the baptism, I deny my (former) service, and attach myself to thee, and I believe in thee. For this is what the prophets Enoch and Elias will preach: Believe not the enemy who is to come and be seen; for he is an adversary<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4261_1311423" id="P4261_1311423" name="P4261_1311423">87</a></sup> and corrupter and son of perdition, and deceives you;<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4262_1311519" id="P4262_1311519" name="P4262_1311519">88</a></sup> and for this reason he will kill you, and smite them with the sword. Behold the deceit of the enemy, know the machinations of the beguiler, how he seeks to darken the mind of men utterly. For he will show forth his demons brilliant like angels, and he will bring in hosts of the incorporeal without number. And in the presence of all he exhibits himself as taken up into heaven with trumpets and sounds, and the mighty shouting of those who hail him with indescribable hymns; the heir of darkness himself shining like light, and at one time soaring to the heavens, and at another descending to the earth with great glory, and again charging the demons, like angels, to execute his behests with much fear and trembling. Then will he send the cohorts of the demons among mountains and caves and dens of the earth, to track out those who have been concealed from his eyes, and to bring them forward to worship him. And those who yield to him he will seal with his seal; but those who refuse to submit to him he will consume with incomparable pains and bitterest torments and machinations, such as never have been, nor have reached the ear of man, nor have been seen by the eye of mortals.</p>

<p>Blessed shall they be who overcome the tyrant then. For they shall be set forth as more illustrious and loftier than the first witnesses; for the former witnesses overcame his minions only, but these overthrow and conquer the accuser himself, the son of perdition.

<p>But let us revert to the matter in hand. When men have received the seal, then, and find neither food nor water, they <i>will</i> approach him with a voice of anguish, saying, Give us to eat and drink, for we all faint with hunger and all manner of straits;<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4269_1313358" id="P4269_1313358" name="P4269_1313358">89</a></sup> and bid the heavens yield us water, and drive off from us the beasts that devour men. Then will that crafty one make answer, mocking them with absolute inhumanity, and saying, The heavens refuse to give rain, the earth yields not again its fruits; whence then can I give you food? Then, on hearing the words of this deceiver, these miserable men will perceive that this is the wicked accuser, and will mourn in anguish, and weep vehemently, and beat their face with their hands, and tear their hair, and lacerate their cheeks with their nails, while they say to each other: Woe for the calamity! woe for the bitter contract! woe for the deceitful covenant! woe for the mighty mischance! How have we been beguiled by the deceiver! how have we been joined to him! how have we been caught in his toils! how have we been taken in his abominable net! how have we heard the Scriptures, and understood them not! For truly those who are engrossed with the affairs of life, and with the lust of this world, will be easily brought over to the accuser then, and sealed by him.</p>

For they will see clearly through his insidious appearance and his deceitful imposture, and will flee from his hands, and betake themselves to the mountains, and hide themselves in the caves of the earth; and they will seek after the Friend of man with tears and a contrite heart; and He will deliver them out of his toils, and with His right hand He will save those from his snares who in a worthy and righteous manner make their supplication to Him.</p>

<p>You see in what manner of fasting and prayer the saints will exercise themselves at that time. Observe, also, how hard the season and the times will be that are to come upon those in city and country alike. At that time they will be brought from the east even unto the west; and they will come up from the west even unto the east, and will weep greatly and wail vehemently. And when the day begins to dawn they will long for the night, in order that they may find rest from their labours; and when the night descends upon them, by reason of the continuous earthquakes and the tempests in the air, they will desire even to behold the light of the day, anti will seek how they may hereafter meet a bitter death.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4277_1316072" id="P4277_1316072" name="P4277_1316072">91</a></sup> At that time the whole earth will bewail the life of anguish, and the sea and air in like manner will bewail it; and the sun, too, will wail; and the wild beasts, together with the fowls, will wail; mountains and hills, and the trees of the plain, will wail on account of the race of man, because all have turned aside from the holy God, and obeyed the deceiver, and received the mark of that abominable one, the enemy of God, instead of the quickening cross of the Saviour.</p>

At that time silver and gold shall be cast out in the streets, and none shall gather them; but all things shall be held an offence. For all shall be eager to escape and to hide themselves, and they shall not be able anywhere to find concealment from the woes<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4284_1317654" id="P4284_1317654" name="P4284_1317654">95</a></sup> of the adversary; but as they carry his mark about them, they shall be readily recognised and declared to be his. Without there shall be fear, and within trembling, both by night and by day. In the street and in the houses there shall be the dead; in the streets and in the houses there shall be hunger and thirst; in the streets there shall be tumults, and in the houses lamentations. And beauty of countenance shall be withered, for their forms shall be like those of the dead; and the beauty of women shall fade, and the desire of all men shall vanish.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, not even then will the merciful and benignant God leave the race of men without all comfort; but He will shorten even those days and the period of three years and a half, and He will curtail those times on account of the remnant of those who hide themselves in the mountains and caves, that the phalanx of all those saints fail not utterly. But these days shall run their course rapidly; and the kingdom of the deceiver and Antichrist shall be speedily removed. And then, in fine, in the glance of an eye shall the fashion of this world pass away, and the power of men<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4288_1318837" id="P4288_1318837" name="P4288_1318837">96</a></sup> shall be brought to nought, and all these visible things shall be destroyed.</p>

<p>In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. Those are the canons of the Church, ordinances which Hippolytus wrote, by whom <i>the Church</i> speaketh; and the number of them is thirty-eight canons. Greeting from the Lord.</p>
<p>Canon First. Of the Catholic faith. Before all things should we speak of the faith, holy and right, regarding our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and we have <i>consequently</i> placed that canon in the faith (the symbol); and we agree in this with all reasonable certitude, that the Trinity is equal perfectly in honour, and equal in glory, and has neither beginning nor end. The Word <i>is</i> the Son of God, and is Himself the Creator of every creature, of things visible and invisible. This we lay down with one accord, in opposition to those who have said boldly, that it is not right <i>to speak</i> of the Word of God as our Lord Jesus Christ spake. We come together chiefly to bring out the holy truth<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4564_1348974" id="P4564_1348974" name="P4564_1348974">199</a></sup> regarding God; and we have separated them, because they do not agree with the Church in theology, nor with us the sons of the Scriptures. On this account we have sundered them from the Church, and have left what concerns them to God, who will judge His creatures with justice.<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4565_1349307" id="P4565_1349307" name="P4565_1349307">200</a></sup> To those, moreover, who are not cognisant of them, we make this known without ill-will, in order that they may not rush into an evil death, like heretics, but may gain eternal life, and teach their sons and their posterity this one true faith.</p>
<p>Canon Second. Of bishops. A bishop should be elected by all the people, and he should be unimpeachable, as it is written of him in the apostle; in the week in which he is ordained, the whole people should also say, We desire him; and there should be silence in the whole hall, and they should all pray in his behalf, and say, O God, stablish him whom Thou hast prepared for us, etc.</p>
<p>Canon Third. Prayer in behalf of him who is made bishop, and the ordinance of the Missa.<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4568_1350080" id="P4568_1350080" name="P4568_1350080">201</a></sup> O God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation, etc.</p>
