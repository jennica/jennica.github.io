<sup>134 </sup>[This able and learned man was much the most formidable of the Pelagian writers. Besides this book, Augustin wrote three large works against him, the treatise <i>Against Two Letters of the Pelagians</i>, and the two treatises <i>Against Julian</i> the last of which is usually called <i>The Unfinished Work</i> from the circumstance that Augustin left it incomplete at his death. Julian was a son of a dear friend of Augustin, and was himself much loved by him. He became a "lector" in 404, and was ordained bishop by Innocent I. about 417. Under Zosimus' vacillating policy he took strong ground on the Pelagian side, and, refusing to sign Zosimus' <i>Tractoria</i>, was exiled with his seventeen fellow-recusants, and passed his long life in vain endeavours to obtain recognition for the Pelagian party. His writings included two letters to Zosimus, a <i>Confession of Faith</i>, the two letters answered in <i>Against Two Letters of the Pelagians</i> (though he seems to have repudiated the former of these), and two large books against Augustin, the first of which was his four books against the first book of the present treatise, against extracts from which the second book was written, whilst Augustin's <i>Against Julian</i>, in six books, traverses the whole work. To this second book Julian replied in a rejoinder addressed to Florus, and consisting of eight books. Augustin's <i>Unfinished Work</i> is a reply to this. Julian's character was as noble as his energy was great and his pen acute. He stands out among his fellow-Pelagians as the sufferer for conscience' sake. A full account of his works may be read in the Preface to Augustin's <i>Unfinished Work</i>, with which may be compared the article on him in Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography-W.] </p>

<sup>3 </sup>This Augustin afterwards did by the publication of six book against Julianus, on receiving his entire work. Augustin tells us (<i>Unfinished Work</i>, i. 19) that he had long endeavoured to procure a copy of Julianus' books for the purpose of refuting them, and only succeeded in getting them after some difficulty and delay. </p>
