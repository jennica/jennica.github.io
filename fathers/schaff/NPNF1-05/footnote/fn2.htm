He was appointed by Honorius to preside over the commission of inquiry into the disputes between the Catholics and Donatists in 411, and held the famous conference between the parties, that met in Carthage on the 1st, 3d, and 8th of June, 411. He discharged this whole business with singular patience, moderation, and good judgment: which appears to have cemented the intimate friendship between him and Augustin. Augustin's treatise on <i>The Spirit and Letter</i> is also addressed to him, and he undertook the <i>City of God</i> on his suggestion. See below, p. 80.-W.] </p>
