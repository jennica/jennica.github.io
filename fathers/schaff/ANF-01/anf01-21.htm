</ul><p>I Glorify God, even Jesus Christ, who has given you such wisdom. For I have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the seed of David according to the flesh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2136_358899" id="P2136_358899" name="P2136_358899">3</a></sup> and the Son of God according to the will and power<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2137_358964" id="P2137_358964" name="P2137_358964">4</a></sup> of God; that He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2138_359152" id="P2138_359152" name="P2138_359152">5</a></sup> by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2139_359295" id="P2139_359295" name="P2139_359295">6</a></sup> we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2140_359429" id="P2140_359429" name="P2140_359429">7</a></sup> for all ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.</p>
<p>I Glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who by Him has given you such wisdom. For I have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded, in very truth, with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ, that He was the Son of God, "the first-born of every creature,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2142_360053" id="P2142_360053" name="P2142_360053">8</a></sup> God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and was of the seed of David according to the flesh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2143_360158" id="P2143_360158" name="P2143_360158">9</a></sup> by the Virgin Mary; was baptized by John, that all righteousness might be fulfilled<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2144_360257" id="P2144_360257" name="P2144_360257">10</a></sup> by Him; that He lived a life of holiness without sin, and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh. From whom we also derive our being,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2145_360470" id="P2145_360470" name="P2145_360470">11</a></sup> from His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for the ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful [followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P2150_360706"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter II.-Christ's True Passion.</font></p>
</ul><p>Now, He suffered all these things for our sakes, that we might be saved. And He suffered truly, even as also He truly raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer, as they themselves only seem to be [Christians]. And as they believe, so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil spirits.<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2153_361118" id="P2153_361118" name="P2153_361118">12</a></sup> </p>
<p>Now, He suffered all these things for us; and He suffered them really, and not in appearance only, even as also He truly rose again. But not, as some of the unbelievers, who are ashamed of the formation of man, and the cross, and death itself, affirm, that in appearance only, and not in truth, He took a body of the Virgin, and suffered only in appearance, forgetting, as they do, Him who said, "The Word was made flesh; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2155_361646" id="P2155_361646" name="P2155_361646">13</a></sup> and again, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2156_361736" id="P2156_361736" name="P2156_361736">14</a></sup> and once more, "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto Me."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2157_361834" id="P2157_361834" name="P2157_361834">15</a></sup> The Word therefore did dwell in flesh, for "Wisdom built herself an house."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2158_361929" id="P2158_361929" name="P2158_361929">16</a></sup> The Word raised up again His own temple on the third day, when it had been destroyed by the Jews fighting against Christ. The Word, when His flesh was lifted up, after the manner of the brazen serpent in the wilderness, drew all men to Himself for their eternal salvation.<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2159_362220" id="P2159_362220" name="P2159_362220">17</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p><a name="P2162_362251"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter III.-Christ Was Possessed of a Body After His Resurrection.</font></p>
</ul><p>For I know that after His resurrection also He was still possessed of flesh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2165_362396" id="P2165_362396" name="P2165_362396">18</a></sup> and I believe that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to them, "Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2166_362604" id="P2166_362604" name="P2166_362604">19</a></sup> And immediately they touched Him, and believed, being convinced both by His flesh and spirit. For this cause also they despised death, and were found its conquerors.<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2167_362889" id="P2167_362889" name="P2167_362889">20</a></sup> And after his resurrection He did eat and drink with them, as being possessed of flesh, although spiritually He was united to the Father.</p>
<p>And I know that He was possessed of a body not only in His being born and crucified, but I also know that He was so after His resurrection, and believe that He is so now. When, for instance, He came to those who were with Peter, He said to them, "Lay hold, handle Me, and see that I am not an incorporeal spirit."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2169_363371" id="P2169_363371" name="P2169_363371">21</a></sup> "For a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2170_363550" id="P2170_363550" name="P2170_363550">22</a></sup> And He says to Thomas, "Reach hither thy finger into the print of the nails, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into My side; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2171_363704" id="P2171_363704" name="P2171_363704">23</a></sup> and immediately they believed that He was Christ. Wherefore Thomas also says to Him, "My Lord, and my God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2172_363830" id="P2172_363830" name="P2172_363830">24</a></sup> And on this account also did they despise death, for it were too little to say, indignities and stripes. Nor was this all; but also after He had shown Himself to them, that He had risen indeed, and not in appearance only, He both ate and drank with them during forty entire days. And thus was He, with the flesh, received up in their sight unto Him that sent Him, being with that same flesh to come again, accompanied by glory and power. For, say the [holy] oracles, "This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come, in like manner as ye have seen Him go unto heaven."<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2173_364438" id="P2173_364438" name="P2173_364438">25</a></sup> But if they say that He will come at the end of the world without a body, how shall those "see Him that pierced Him,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2174_364573" id="P2174_364573" name="P2174_364573">26</a></sup> and when they recognise Him, "mourn for themselves? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2175_364643" id="P2175_364643" name="P2175_364643">27</a></sup> For incorporeal beings have neither form nor figure, nor the aspect<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2176_364731" id="P2176_364731" name="P2176_364731">28</a></sup> of an animal possessed of shape, because their nature is in itself simple.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter IV.-Beware of These Heretics.</font></p>
</ul><p>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as I do]. But I guard you beforehand from those beasts in the shape of men, whom you must not only not receive, but, if it be possible, not even meet with; only you must pray to God for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance, which, however, will be very difficult. Yet Jesus Christ, who is our true life, has the power of [effecting] this. But if these things were done by our Lord only in appearance, then am I also only in appearance bound. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact, ] he who is near to the sword is near to God; he that is among the wild beasts is in company with God; provided only he be so m the name of Jesus Christ. I undergo all these things that I may suffer together with Him,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2182_365731" id="P2182_365731" name="P2182_365731">29</a></sup> He who became a perfect man inwardly strengthening me.<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2183_365812" id="P2183_365812" name="P2183_365812">30</a></sup> </p>
<p>I give you these instructions, beloved, assured that ye also hold the same opinions [as I do]. But I guard you beforehand from these beasts in the shape of men, from whom you must not only turn away, but even flee from them. Only you must pray for them, if by any means they may be brought to repentance. For if the Lord were in the body in appearance only, and were crucified in appearance only, then am I also bound in appearance only. And why have I also surrendered myself to death, to fire, to the sword, to the wild beasts? But, [in fact, ] I endure all things for Christ, not in appearance only, but in reality, that I may suffer together with Him, while He Himself inwardly strengthens me; for of myself I have no such ability.</p>

These persons neither have the prophets persuaded, nor the law of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually endured.

Yea, far be it from me to make any mention of them, until they repent and return to [a true belief in] Christ's passion, which is our resurrection.</p>
<p>Some have ignorantly denied Him, and advocate falsehood rather than the truth. These persons neither have the prophecies persuaded, nor the law of Moses, nor the Gospel even to this day, nor the sufferings we have individually endured. For they think also the same thing regarding us.

<font size="3">Chapter VI-Unbelievers in the Blood of Christ Shall Be Condemned.</font></p>
</ul><p>Let no man deceive himself. Both the things which are in heaven, and the glorious angels,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2203_368457" id="P2203_368457" name="P2203_368457">36</a></sup> and rulers, both visible and invisible, if they believe not in the blood of Christ, shall, in consequence, incur condemnation.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2204_368628" id="P2204_368628" name="P2204_368628">37</a></sup> "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2205_368720" id="P2205_368720" name="P2205_368720">38</a></sup> Let not [high] place puff any one up: for that which is worth all is<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2206_368809" id="P2206_368809" name="P2206_368809">39</a></sup> faith and love, to which nothing is to be preferred. But consider those who are of a different opinion with respect to the grace of Christ which has come unto us, how opposed they are to the will of God. They have no regard for love; no care for the widow, or the orphan, or the oppressed; of the bond, or of the free; of the hungry, or of the thirsty.</p>
<p>Let no man deceive himself. Unless he believes that Christ Jesus has lived in the flesh, and shall confess His cross and passion, and the blood which He shed for the salvation of the world, he shall not obtain eternal life, whether he be a king, or a priest, or a ruler, or a private person, a master or a servant, a man or a woman. "He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2208_369579" id="P2208_369579" name="P2208_369579">40</a></sup> Let no man's place, or dignity, or riches, puff him up; and let no man's low condition or poverty abase him. For the chief points are faith towards God, hope towards Christ, the enjoyment of those good things for which we look, and love towards God and our neighbour. For, "Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2209_369957" id="P2209_369957" name="P2209_369957">41</a></sup> And the Lord says, "This is life eternal, to know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He has sent."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2210_370080" id="P2210_370080" name="P2210_370080">42</a></sup> And again, "A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2211_370235" id="P2211_370235" name="P2211_370235">43</a></sup> Do ye, therefore, notice those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known, and how they exhibit enmity and deceit in their dealings with one another. They have no regard for love; they despise the good things we expect hereafter; they regard present things as if they were durable; they ridicule him that is in affliction; they laugh at him that is in bonds.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P2216_370671"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter VII.-Let Us Stand Aloof from Such Heretics.</font></p>
</ul><p>They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2219_370772" id="P2219_370772" name="P2219_370772">44</a></sup> because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again.

<font size="3">Chapter VIII.-Let Nothing Be Done Without the Bishop.</font></p>
</ul><p>See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles; and reverence the deacons, as being the institution<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2236_373444" id="P2236_373444" name="P2236_373444">55</a></sup> of God.

Let that be deemed a proper<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2237_373569" id="P2237_373569" name="P2237_373569">56</a></sup> Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as, wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God, so that everything that is done may be secure and valid.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2238_374038" id="P2238_374038" name="P2238_374038">57</a></sup> </p>
<p>See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Christ Jesus does the Father, and the presbytery as ye would the apostles. Do ye also reverence the deacons, as those that carry out [through their office] the appointment of God. Let no man do anything connected with the Church without the bishop. Let that be deemed a proper<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2240_374375" id="P2240_374375" name="P2240_374375">58</a></sup> Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the bishop shall appear, there let the multitude [of the people] also be; even as where Christ is, there does all the heavenly host stand by, waiting upon Him as the Chief Captain of the Lord's might, and the Governor of every intelligent nature. It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize, or to offer, or to present sacrifice, or to celebrate a love-feast.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2241_374868" id="P2241_374868" name="P2241_374868">59</a></sup> But that which seems good to him, is also well-pleasing to God, that everything ye do may be secure and valid.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter IX.-Honour the Bishop.</font></p>
</ul><p>Moreover,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2249_375066" id="P2249_375066" name="P2249_375066">60</a></sup> it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. It is well to reverence<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2250_375260" id="P2250_375260" name="P2250_375260">61</a></sup> both God and the bishop. He who honours the bishop has been honoured by God; he who does anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve the devil. Let all things, then, abound to you through grace, for ye are worthy. Ye have refreshed me in all things, and Jesus Christ [shall refresh] you. Ye have loved me when absent as well as when present. May God recompense you, for whose sake, while ye endure all things, ye shall attain unto Him.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is in accordance with reason that we should return to soberness [of conduct], and, while yet we have opportunity, exercise repentance towards God. For "in Hades there is no one who can confess his sins."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2252_375965" id="P2252_375965" name="P2252_375965">62</a></sup> For "behold the man, and his work is before him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2253_376031" id="P2253_376031" name="P2253_376031">63</a></sup> And [the Scripture saith], "My son, honour thou God and the king."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2254_376118" id="P2254_376118" name="P2254_376118">64</a></sup> And say I, Honour thou God indeed, as the Author and Lord of all things, but the bishop as the high-priest, who bears the image of God-of God. inasmuch as he is a ruler, and of Christ, in his capacity of a priest. After Him, we must also honour the king. For there is no one superior to God, or even like to Him, among all the beings that exist. Nor is there any one in the Church greater than the bishop, who ministers as a priest to God for the salvation of the whole world. Nor, again, is there any one among rulers to be compared with the king, who secures peace and good order to those over whom he rules. He who honours the bishop shall be honoured by God, even as he that dishonours him shall be punished by God. For if he that rises up against kings is justly held worthy of punishment, inasmuch as he dissolves public order, of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2255_377043" id="P2255_377043" name="P2255_377043">65</a></sup> who presumes to do anything without the bishop, thus both destroying the [Church's] unity, and throwing its order into confusion? For the priesthood is the very highest point of all good things among men, against which whosoever is mad enough to strive, dishonours not man, but God, and Christ Jesus, the First-born, and the only High Priest, by nature, of the Father. Let all things therefore be done by you with good order in Christ. Let the laity be subject to the deacons; the deacons to the presbyters; the presbyters to the bishop; the bishop to Christ, even as He is to the Father. As ye, brethren, have refreshed me, so will Jesus Christ refresh you. Ye have loved me when absent, as well as when present. God will recompense you, for whose sake ye have shown such kindness towards His prisoner. For even if I am not worthy of it, yet your zeal [to help me] is an admirable<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2256_377948" id="P2256_377948" name="P2256_377948">66</a></sup> thing. For "he who honours a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward."<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2257_378064" id="P2257_378064" name="P2257_378064">67</a></sup> It is manifest also, that he who honours a prisoner of Jesus Christ shall receive the reward of the martyrs.</p>
