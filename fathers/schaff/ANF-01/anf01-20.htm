For he is in harmony with the commandments [of God], even as the harp is with its strings. Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1957_330805" id="P1957_330805" name="P1957_330805">6</a></sup> meekness of the living God.</p>
<p>Having beheld your bishop, I know that he was not selected to undertake the ministry which pertains to the common [weal], either by himself or by men,<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1959_331005" id="P1959_331005" name="P1959_331005">7</a></sup> or out of vainglory, but by the love of Jesus Christ, and of God the Father, who raised Him from the dead; at whose meekness I am struck with admiration, and who by His silence is able to accomplish more than they who talk a great deal. For he is in harmony with the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, even as the strings are with the harp, and is no less blameless than was Zacharias the priest.<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1960_331428" id="P1960_331428" name="P1960_331428">8</a></sup> Wherefore my soul declares his mind towards God a happy one, knowing it to be virtuous and perfect, and that his stability as well as freedom from all anger is after the example of the infinite meekness of the living God.</p>

For there are many wolves that appear worthy of credit, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1966_331956" id="P1966_331956" name="P1966_331956">9</a></sup> those that are running towards God; but in your unity they shall have no place.</p>
<p>Wherefore, as children of light and truth, avoid the dividing of your unity, and the wicked doctrine of the heretics, from whom "a defiling influence has gone forth into all the earth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1968_332246" id="P1968_332246" name="P1968_332246">10</a></sup> But where the shepherd is, there do ye as sheep follow.

<font size="3">Chapter III.-Avoid Schismatics.</font></p>
</ul><p>Keep yourselves from those evil plants which Jesus Christ does not tend, because they are not the planting of the Father. Not that I have found any division among you, but exceeding purity. For as many as are of God and of Jesus Christ are also with the bishop. And as many as shall, in the exercise of repentance, return into the unity of the Church, these, too, shall belong to God, that they may live according to Jesus Christ. Do not err, my brethren. If any man follows him that makes a schism in the Church, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God. If any one walks according to a strange<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1978_333181" id="P1978_333181" name="P1978_333181">13</a></sup> opinion, he agrees not with the passion [of Christ.].</p>
<p>Keep yourselves, then, from those evil planes which Jesus Christ does not tend, but that wild beast, the destroyer of men, because they are not the planting of the Father, but the seed of the wicked one. Not that I have found any division among you do I write these things; but I arm you beforehand, as the children of God. For as many as are of Christ are also with the bishop; but as many as fall away from him, and embrace communion with the accursed, these shall be cut off along with them. For they are not Christ's husbandry, but the seed of the enemy, from whom may you ever be delivered by the prayers of the shepherd, that most faithful and gentle shepherd who presides over you. I therefore exhort you in the Lord to receive with all tenderness those that repent and return to the unity of the Church, that through your kindness and forbearance they may recover<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1980_334128" id="P1980_334128" name="P1980_334128">14</a></sup> themselves out of the snare of the devil, and becoming worthy of Jesus Christ, may obtain eternal salvation in the kingdom of Christ. Brethren, be not deceived. If any man follows him that separates from the truth, he shall not inherit the kingdom of God; and if any man does not stand aloof from the preacher of falsehood, he shall be condemned to hell. For it is obligatory neither to separate from the godly, nor to associate with the ungodly. If any one walks according to a strange<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1981_334635" id="P1981_334635" name="P1981_334635">15</a></sup> opinion, he is not of Christ, nor a partaker of His passion; but is a fox,<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1982_334732" id="P1982_334732" name="P1982_334732">16</a></sup> a destroyer of the vineyard of Christ. Have no fellowship<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1983_334822" id="P1983_334822" name="P1983_334822">17</a></sup> with such a man, lest ye perish along with him, even should he be thy father, thy son, thy brother, or a member of thy family. For says [the Scripture], "Thine eye shall not spare him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1984_335033" id="P1984_335033" name="P1984_335033">18</a></sup> You ought therefore to "hate those that hate God, and to waste away [with grief] on account of His enemies."<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1985_335166" id="P1985_335166" name="P1985_335166">19</a></sup> I do not mean that you should beat them or persecute them, as do the Gentiles "that know not the Lord and God; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1986_335298" id="P1986_335298" name="P1986_335298">20</a></sup> but that you should regard them as your enemies, and separate yourselves from them, while yet you admonish them, and exhort them to repentance, if it may be they will hear, if it may be they will submit themselves. For our God is a lover of mankind, and "will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1987_335648" id="P1987_335648" name="P1987_335648">21</a></sup> Wherefore "He makes His sun to rise upon the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1988_335784" id="P1988_335784" name="P1988_335784">22</a></sup> of whose kindness the Lord, wishing us also to be imitators, says, "Be ye perfect, even as also your Father that is in heaven is perfect."<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1989_335941" id="P1989_335941" name="P1989_335941">23</a></sup> </p>

<p>I have confidence of you in the Lord, that ye will be of no other mind. Wherefore I write boldly to your love, which is worthy of God, and exhort you to have but one faith, and one [kind of] preaching, and one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of the Lord Jesus Christ; and His blood which was shed for us is one; one loaf also is broken to all [the communicants], and one cup is distributed among them all: there is but one altar for the whole Church, and one bishop, with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants. Since, also, there is but one unbegotten Being, God, even the Father; and one only-begotten Son, God, the Word and man; and one Comforter, the Spirit of truth; and also one preaching, and one faith, and one baptism;<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1999_337076" id="P1999_337076" name="P1999_337076">25</a></sup> and one Church which the holy apostles established from one end of the earth to the other by the blood of Christ, and by their own sweat and toil; it behoves you also, therefore, as "a peculiar people, and a holy nation,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2000_337315" id="P2000_337315" name="P2000_337315">26</a></sup> to perform all things with harmony in Christ. Wives, be ye subject to your husbands in the fear of God;<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2001_337449" id="P2001_337449" name="P2001_337449">27</a></sup> and ye virgins, to Christ in purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring that which is better, not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake of meditating on the law. Children, obey your parents, and have an affection for them, as workers together with God for your birth [into the world]. Servants, be subject to your masters in God, that ye may be the freed-men of Christ.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2002_337860" id="P2002_337860" name="P2002_337860">28</a></sup> Husbands, love your wives, as fellow-servants of God, as your own body, as the partners of your life, and your co-adjutors in the procreation of children. Virgins, have Christ alone before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being enlightened by the Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun, as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this life in [perfect] chastity,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2003_338444" id="P2003_338444" name="P2003_338444">29</a></sup> Not, however, that I blame the other blessed [saints] because they entered into the married state, of which I have just spoken.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2004_338703" id="P2004_338703" name="P2004_338703">30</a></sup> For I pray that, being found worthy of God, I may be found at their feet in the kingdom, as at the feet of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph, and Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, that were married men. For they entered into these marriages not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of mankind. Fathers, "bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2005_339234" id="P2005_339234" name="P2005_339234">31</a></sup> and teach them the holy Scriptures, and also trades, that they may not indulge in idleness. Now [the Scripture] says, "A righteous father educates [his children] well; his heart shall rejoice in a wise son."<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2006_339459" id="P2006_339459" name="P2006_339459">32</a></sup> Masters, be gentle towards your servants, as holy Job has taught you;<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2007_339551" id="P2007_339551" name="P2007_339551">33</a></sup> for there is one nature, and one family of mankind.

And thus unity is preserved throughout. Let not the widows be wanderers about, nor fond of dainties, nor gadders from house to house; but let them be like Judith, noted for her seriousness; and like Anna, eminent for her sobriety. I do not ordain these things as an apostle: for "who am I, or what is my father's house,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2009_340349" id="P2009_340349" name="P2009_340349">35</a></sup> that I should pretend to be equal in honour to them?

But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain to that portion which through mercy has been allotted me, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus, and to the apostles as to the presbytery of the Church.

<p>My brethren, I am greatly enlarged in loving you; and rejoicing exceedingly [over you], I seek to secure your safety. Yet it is not I, but the Lord Jesus through me; for whose sake being bound, I fear the more, for I am not yet perfect. But your prayer to God shall make me perfect, that I may attain that to which I have been called, while I flee to the Gospel as to the flesh of Jesus Christ, and to the apostles as the presbytery of the Church. I do also love the prophets as those who announced Christ, and as being partakers of the same Spirit with the apostles. For as the false prophets and the false apostles drew [to themselves] one and the same wicked, deceitful, and seducing<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2021_342164" id="P2021_342164" name="P2021_342164">39</a></sup> spirit; so also did the prophets and the apostles receive from God, through Jesus Christ, one and the same Holy Spirit, who is good, and sovereign,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2022_342348" id="P2022_342348" name="P2022_342348">40</a></sup> and true, and the Author of [saving] knowledge.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2023_342425" id="P2023_342425" name="P2023_342425">41</a></sup> For there is one God of the Old and New Testament, "one Mediator between God and men," for the creation of both intelligent and sensitive beings, and in order to exercise a beneficial and suitable providence [over them]. There is also one Comforter, who displayed<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2024_342717" id="P2024_342717" name="P2024_342717">42</a></sup> His power in Moses, and the prophets, and apostles.

For it is better to hearken to Christian doctrine from a man who has been circumcised, than to Judaism from one uncircumcised.

<p>If any one preaches the one God of the law and the prophets, but denies Christ to be the Son of God, he is a liar, even as also is his father the devil,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2036_344310" id="P2036_344310" name="P2036_344310">48</a></sup> and is a Jew falsely so called, being possessed of<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2037_344386" id="P2037_344386" name="P2037_344386">49</a></sup> mere carnal circumcision. If any one confesses Christ Jesus the Lord, but denies the God of the law and of the prophets, saying that the Father of Christ is not the Maker of heaven and earth, he has not continued in the truth any more than his father the devil,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2038_344675" id="P2038_344675" name="P2038_344675">50</a></sup> and is a disciple of Simon Magus, not of the Holy Spirit.

If any one confesses the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and praises the creation, but calls the incarnation merely an appearance, and is ashamed of the passion, such an one has denied the faith, not less than the Jews who killed Christ. If any one confesses these things, and that God the Word did dwell in a human body, being within it as the Word, even as the soul also is in the body, because it was God that inhabited it, and not a human soul, but affirms that unlawful unions are a good thing, and places the highest happiness<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2042_346051" id="P2042_346051" name="P2042_346051">54</a></sup> in pleasure, as does the man who is falsely called a Nicolaitan, this person can neither be a lover of God, nor a lover of Christ, but is a corrupter of his own flesh, and therefore void of the Holy Spirit, and a stranger to Christ.

<p>For though some would have deceived me according to the flesh, yet my spirit is not deceived; for I have received it from God. For it knows both whence it comes and whither it goes, and detects the secrets [of the heart]. For when I was among you, I cried, I spoke with a loud voice-the word is not mine, but God's-Give heed to the bishop, and to the presbytery and deacons. But if ye suspect that I spake thus, as having learned beforehand the division caused by some among you, He is my witness, for whose sake I am in bonds, that I learned nothing of it from the mouth of any man. But the Spirit made an announcement to me, saying as follows: Do nothing without the bishop; keep your bodies<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2060_348970" id="P2060_348970" name="P2060_348970">64</a></sup> as the temples of God; love unity; avoid divisions; be ye followers of Paul, and of the rest of the apostles, even as they also were of Christ.</p>

For where there is division and wrath, God doth not dwell. To all them that repent, the Lord grants forgiveness, if they turn in penitence to the unity of God, and to communion with the bishop.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2069_349466" id="P2069_349466" name="P2069_349466">66</a></sup> I trust [as to you] in the grace of Jesus Christ, who shall free you from every bond. And I exhort you to do nothing out of strife, but according to the doctrine of Christ.

But to me Jesus Christ is in the place of all that is ancient: His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2071_350140" id="P2071_350140" name="P2071_350140">68</a></sup> which is by Him, are undefiled monuments of antiquity; by which I desire, through your prayers, to be justified.</p>
<p>I therefore did what belonged to me, as a man devoted to unity; adding this also, that where there is diversity of judgment, and wrath, and hatred, God does not dwell. To all them that repent, God grants forgiveness, if they with one consent return to the unity of Christ, and communion with the bishop.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2073_350601" id="P2073_350601" name="P2073_350601">69</a></sup> I trust to the grace of Jesus Christ, that He will free you from every bond of wickedness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2074_350741" id="P2074_350741" name="P2074_350741">70</a></sup> I therefore exhort you that ye do nothing out of strife,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2075_350824" id="P2075_350824" name="P2075_350824">71</a></sup> but according to the doctrine of Christ. For I have heard some saying, If I do not find the Gospel in the archives, I will not believe it. To such persons I say that my archives are Jesus Christ, to disobey whom is manifest destruction. My authentic archives are His cross, and death, and resurrection, and the faith which bears on these things, by which I desire, through your prayers, to be justified.

He is the door of the Father, by which enter in Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets, and the apostles, and the Church. All these have for their object the attaining to the unity of God. But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz., the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, His passion and resurrection. For the beloved prophets announced Him,<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2084_352237" id="P2084_352237" name="P2084_352237">75</a></sup> but the Gospel is the perfection of immortality.<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2085_352326" id="P2085_352326" name="P2085_352326">76</a></sup> All these things are good together, if ye believe in love.</p>

The ministering powers of God are good. The Comforter is holy, and the Word is holy, the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and exercises a providence over them all.

All these things tend towards the unity of the one and only true God. But the Gospel possesses something transcendent [above the former dispensation], viz. the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, His passion, and the resurrection itself.
