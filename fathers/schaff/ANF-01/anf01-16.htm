May I always have joy of you, if indeed I be worthy of it. It is therefore befitting that you should in every way glorify Jesus Christ, who hath glorified you, that by a unanimous obedience "ye may be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, and may all speak the same thing concerning the same thing,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1132_211147" id="P1132_211147" name="P1132_211147">21</a></sup> and that, being subject to the bishop and the presbytery, ye may in all respects be sanctified.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter III.-Exhortations to Unity.</font></p>
</ul><p>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for the name [of Christ], I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as fellow-disciples with me. For it was needful for me to have been stirred up by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1144_212835" id="P1144_212835" name="P1144_212835">27</a></sup> upon me first to exhort you that ye would all run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ, our inseparable life, is the [manifested] will of the Father; as also bishops, settled everywhere to the utmost bounds [of the earth], are so by the will of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I do not issue orders to you, as if I were some great person. For though I am bound for His name, I am not yet perfect in Jesus Christ. For now I begin to be a disciple, and I speak to you as my fellow-servants. For it was needful for me to have been admonished by you in faith, exhortation, patience, and long-suffering. But inasmuch as love suffers me not to be silent in regard to you, I have therefore taken<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1146_213560" id="P1146_213560" name="P1146_213560">28</a></sup> upon me first to exhort you that ye would run together in accordance with the will of God. For even Jesus Christ does all things according to the will of the Father, as He Himself declares in a certain place, "I do always those things that please Him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1147_213838" id="P1147_213838" name="P1147_213838">29</a></sup> Wherefore it behoves us also to live according to the will of God in Christ, and to imitate Him as Paul did. For, says he, "Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1148_214035" id="P1148_214035" name="P1148_214035">30</a></sup> </p>
<ul><p><a name="P1151_214053"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter IV.-The Same Continued.</font></p>
</ul><p>Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance with the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renowned presbytery, worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Therefore in your concord and harmonious love, Jesus Christ is sung. And do ye, man by man, become a choir, that being harmonious in love, and taking up the song of God in unison, ye may with one voice sing to the Father through Jesus Christ, so that He may both hear you, and perceive by your works that ye are indeed the members of His Son. It is profitable, therefore, that you should live in an unblameable unity, that thus ye may always enjoy communion with God.</p>
<p>Wherefore it is fitting that ye also should run together in accordance with the will of the bishop who by God's appointment<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1155_214915" id="P1155_214915" name="P1155_214915">31</a></sup> rules over you. Which thing ye indeed of yourselves do, being instructed by the Spirit. For your justly-renowned presbytery, being worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp. Thus, being joined together in concord and harmonious love, of which Jesus Christ is the Captain and Guardian, do ye, man by man, become but one choir; so that, agreeing together in concord, and obtaining<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1156_215370" id="P1156_215370" name="P1156_215370">32</a></sup> a perfect unity with God, ye may indeed be one in harmonious feeling with God the Father, and His beloved Son Jesus Christ our Lord. For, says He, "Grant unto them, Holy Father, that as I and Thou are one, they also may be one in us."<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1157_215660" id="P1157_215660" name="P1157_215660">33</a></sup> It is therefore profitable that you, being joined together with God in an unblameable unity, should be the followers of the example of Christ, of whom also ye are members.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P1162_215854"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter V.-The Praise of Unity.</font></p>
</ul><p>For if I in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature-how much more do I reckon you happy who are so joined to him as the Church is to Jesus Christ, and as Jesus Christ is to the Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1165_216338" id="P1165_216338" name="P1165_216338">34</a></sup> such power, how much more that of the bishop and the whole Church! He, therefore, that does not assemble with the Church, has even<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1166_216491" id="P1166_216491" name="P1166_216491">35</a></sup> by this manifested his pride, and condemned himself. For it is written, "God resisteth the proud."<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1167_216610" id="P1167_216610" name="P1167_216610">36</a></sup> Let us be careful, then, not to set ourselves in opposition to the bishop, in order that we may be subject to God.</p>
<p>For if I, in this brief space of time, have enjoyed such fellowship with your bishop-I mean not of a mere human, but of a spiritual nature-how much more do I reckon you happy, who so depend<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1169_216960" id="P1169_216960" name="P1169_216960">37</a></sup> on him as the Church does on the Lord Jesus, and the Lord does on God and His Father, that so all things may agree in unity! Let no man deceive himself: if any one be not within the altar, he is deprived of the bread of God. For if the prayer of one or two possesses<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1170_217260" id="P1170_217260" name="P1170_217260">38</a></sup> such power that Christ stands in the midst of them, how much more will the prayer of the bishop and of the whole Church, ascending up in harmony to God, prevail for the granting of all their petitions in Christ! He, therefore, that separates himself from such, and does not meet in the society where sacrifices<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1171_217593" id="P1171_217593" name="P1171_217593">39</a></sup> are offered, and with "the Church of the first-born whose names are written in heaven," is a wolf in sheep's clothing,<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1172_217761" id="P1172_217761" name="P1172_217761">40</a></sup> while he presents a mild outward appearance. Do ye, beloved, be careful to be subject to the bishop, and the presbyters and the deacons. For he that is subject to these is obedient to Christ, who has appointed them; but he that is disobedient to these is disobedient to Christ Jesus. And "he that obeyeth not<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1173_218090" id="P1173_218090" name="P1173_218090">41</a></sup> the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him." For he that yields not obedience to his superiors is self-confident, quarrelsome, and proud. But" God," says [the Scripture] "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble ; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1174_218379" id="P1174_218379" name="P1174_218379">42</a></sup> and, "The proud have greatly transgressed." The Lord also says to the priests, "He that heareth you, heareth Me; and he that heareth Me, heareth the Father that sent Me. He that despiseth you, despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me, despiseth Him that sent Me."</p>

<font size="3">Chapter VI.-Have Respect to the Bishop as to Christ Himself.</font></p>
</ul><p>Now the more any one sees the bishop keeping silence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1180_218800" id="P1180_218800" name="P1180_218800">43</a></sup> the more ought he to revere him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1181_218965" id="P1181_218965" name="P1181_218965">44</a></sup> as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would upon the Lord Himself. And indeed Onesimus himself greatly commends your good order in God, that ye all live according to the truth, and that no sect<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1182_219257" id="P1182_219257" name="P1182_219257">45</a></sup> has any dwelling-place among you. Nor, indeed, do ye hearken to any one rather than to Jesus Christ speaking in truth.</p>
<p>The more, therefore, you see the bishop silent, the more do you reverence him. For we ought to receive every one whom the Master of the house sends to be over His household,<sup><a href="footnote/fn11.htm#P1184_219568" id="P1184_219568" name="P1184_219568">46</a></sup> as we would do Him that sent him. It is manifest, therefore, that we should look upon the bishop even as we would look upon the Lord Himself, standing, as he does, before the Lord.

For he who shall both "do and teach, the same shall be great in the kingdom."<sup><a href="footnote/fn13.htm#P1309_238331" id="P1309_238331" name="P1309_238331">109</a></sup> Our Lord and God, Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, first did and then taught, as Luke testifies, "whose praise is in the Gospel through all the Churches."<sup><a href="footnote/fn13.htm#P1310_238515" id="P1310_238515" name="P1310_238515">110</a></sup> There is nothing which is hid from the Lord, but our very secrets are near to Him. Let us therefore do all things as those who have Him dwelling in us, that we may be His temples,<sup><a href="footnote/fn13.htm#P1311_238719" id="P1311_238719" name="P1311_238719">111</a></sup> and He may be in us as God. Let Christ speak in us, even as He did in Paul. Let the Holy Spirit teach us to speak the things of Christ in like manner as He did.</p>
