<ul><p><a name="P1427_252408"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter III.-Honour Your Youthful Bishop.</font></p>
</ul><p>Now it becomes you also not to treat your bishop too familiarly on account of his youth,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1430_252539" id="P1430_252539" name="P1430_252539">12</a></sup> but to yield him all reverence, having respect to<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1431_252638" id="P1431_252638" name="P1431_252638">13</a></sup> the power of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do, not judging rashly, from the manifest youthful appearance<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1432_252798" id="P1432_252798" name="P1432_252798">14</a></sup> [of their bishop], but as being themselves prudent in God, submitting to him, or rather not to him, but to the Father of Jesus Christ, the bishop of us all. It is therefore fitting that you should, after no hypocritical fashion, obey [your bishop], in honour of Him who has wired us [so to do], since he that does not so deceives not [by such conduct] the bishop that is visible, but seeks to mock Him that is invisible. And all such conduct has reference not to man,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1433_253304" id="P1433_253304" name="P1433_253304">15</a></sup> but to God, who knows all secrets.</p>
<p>Now it becomes you also not to despise the age of your bishop, but to yield him all reverence, according to the will of God the Father, as I have known even holy presbyters do, not having regard to the manifest youth [of their bishop], but to his knowledge in God; inasmuch as "not the ancient are [necessarily] wise, nor do the aged understand prudence; but there is a spirit in men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1435_253752" id="P1435_253752" name="P1435_253752">16</a></sup> For Daniel the wise, at twelve years of age, became possessed of the divine Spirit, and convicted the elders, who in vain carried their grey hairs, of being false accusers, and of lusting after the beauty of another man's wife.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1436_254002" id="P1436_254002" name="P1436_254002">17</a></sup> Samuel also, when he was but a little child, reproved Eli, who was ninety years old, for giving honour to his sons rather than to God.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1437_254162" id="P1437_254162" name="P1437_254162">18</a></sup> In like manner, Jeremiah also received this message from God, "Say not, I am a child."<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1438_254269" id="P1438_254269" name="P1438_254269">19</a></sup> Solomon too, and Josiah, [exemplified the same thing.] The former, being made king at twelve years of age, gave that terrible and difficult judgment in the case of the two women concerning their children.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1439_254489" id="P1439_254489" name="P1439_254489">20</a></sup> The latter, coming to the throne when eight years old<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1440_254565" id="P1440_254565" name="P1440_254565">21</a></sup> cast down the altars and temples [of the idols], and burned down the groves, for they were dedicated to demons, and not to God. And he slew the false priests, as the corrupters and deceivers of men, and not the worshippers of the Deity. Wherefore youth is not to be despised when it is devoted to God. But he is to be despised who is of a wicked mind, although he be old, and full of wicked days.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1441_254988" id="P1441_254988" name="P1441_254988">22</a></sup> Timothy the Christ-bearer was young, but hear what his teacher writes to him: "Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the believers in word and in conduct."<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1442_255190" id="P1442_255190" name="P1442_255190">23</a></sup> It is becoming, therefore, that ye also should be obedient to your bishop, and contradict him in nothing; for it is a fearful thing to contradict any such person. For no one does [by such conduct] deceive him that is visible, but does [in reality] seek to mock Him that is invisible, who, however, cannot be mocked by any one. And every such act has respect not to man, but to God. For God says to Samuel, "They have not mocked thee, but Me."<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1443_255653" id="P1443_255653" name="P1443_255653">24</a></sup> And Moses declares, "For their murmuring is not against us, but against the Lord God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1444_255761" id="P1444_255761" name="P1444_255761">25</a></sup> No one of those has, [in fact, ] remained unpunished, who rose up against their superiors. For Dathan and Abiram did not speak against the law, but against Moses,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1445_255941" id="P1445_255941" name="P1445_255941">26</a></sup> and were cast down alive into Hades. Korah also,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1446_256008" id="P1446_256008" name="P1446_256008">27</a></sup> and the two hundred and fifty who conspired with him against Aaron, were destroyed by fire. Absalom, again,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1447_256135" id="P1447_256135" name="P1447_256135">28</a></sup> who had slain his brother, became suspended on a tree, and had his evil-designing heart thrust through with darts. In like manner was Abeddadan<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1448_256302" id="P1448_256302" name="P1448_256302">29</a></sup> beheaded for the same reason. Uzziah,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1449_256402" id="P1449_256402" name="P1449_256402">30</a></sup> when he presumed to oppose the priests and the priesthood, was smitten with leprosy. Saul also was dishonoured,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1450_256538" id="P1450_256538" name="P1450_256538">31</a></sup> because he did not wait for Samuel the high priest. It behoves you, therefore, also to reverence your superiors.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P1455_256672"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter IV.-Some Wickedly Act Independently of the Bishop.</font></p>
</ul><p>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality: as some indeed give one the title of bishop, but do all things without him. Now such persons seem to me to be not possessed of a good conscience, seeing they are not stedfastly gathered together according to the commandment.</p>
<p>It is fitting, then, not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality. For it is not the being called so, but the being really so, that renders a man blessed. To those who indeed talk of the bishop, but do all things without him, will He who is the true and first Bishop, and the only High Priest by nature, declare, "Why call ye Me Lord, and do not the things which I say? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1459_257420" id="P1459_257420" name="P1459_257420">32</a></sup> For such persons seem to me not possessed of a good conscience, but to be simply dissemblers and hypocrites.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P1462_257545"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter V.-Death is the Fate of All Such.</font></p>
</ul><p>Seeing, then, all things have an end, these two things are simultaneously set before us-death and life; and every one shall go unto his own place. For as there are two kinds of coins, the one of God, the other of the world, and each of these has its special character stamped upon it, [so is it also here.]<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1465_257894" id="P1465_257894" name="P1465_257894">33</a></sup> The unbelieving are of this world; but the believing have, in love, the character of God the Father by Jesus Christ, by whom, if we are not in readiness to die into His passion,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1466_258172" id="P1466_258172" name="P1466_258172">34</a></sup> His life is not in us.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, all things have an end, and there is set before us life upon our observance [of God's precepts], but death as the result of disobedience, and every one, according to the choice he makes, shall go to his own place, let us flee from death, and make choice of life. For I remark, that two different characters are found among men-the one true coin, the other spurious. The truly devout man is the right kind of coin, stamped by God Himself. The ungodly man, again, is false coin, unlawful, spurious, counterfeit, wrought not by God, but by the devil. I do not mean to say that there are two different human natures, but that there is one humanity, sometimes belonging to God, and sometimes to the devil. If any one is truly religious, he is a man of God; but if he is irreligious, he is a man of the devil, made such, not by nature, but by his own choice. The unbelieving bear the image of the prince of wickedness. The believing possess the image of their Prince, God the Father, and Jesus Christ, through whom, if we are not in readiness to die for the truth into His passion,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1468_259330" id="P1468_259330" name="P1468_259330">35</a></sup> His life is not in us.</p>

Do ye all then, imitating the same divine conduct,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1476_260022" id="P1476_260022" name="P1476_260022">38</a></sup> pay respect to one another, and let no one look upon his neighbour after the flesh, but do ye continually love each other in Jesus Christ. Let nothing exist among you that may divide you ; but be ye united with your bishop, and those that preside over you, as a type and evidence of your immortality.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1477_260376" id="P1477_260376" name="P1477_260376">39</a></sup> </p>
<p>Since therefore I have, in the persons before mentioned, beheld the whole multitude of you in faith and love, I exhort you to study to do all things with a divine harmony,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1479_260584" id="P1479_260584" name="P1479_260584">40</a></sup> while your bishop presides in the place of God, and your presbyters in the place of the assembly of the apostles, along with your deacons, who are most dear to me, and are entrusted with the ministry of Jesus Christ. He, being begotten by the Father before the beginning of time,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1480_260901" id="P1480_260901" name="P1480_260901">41</a></sup> was God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same for ever; for "of His kingdom there shall be no end,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1481_261052" id="P1481_261052" name="P1481_261052">42</a></sup> says Daniel the prophet. Let us all therefore love one another in harmony, and let no one look upon his neighbour according to the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. Let nothing exist among you which may divide you; but be ye united with your bishop, being through him subject to God in Christ.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P1486_261369"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter VII.-Do Nothing Without the Bishop and Presbyters.</font></p>
</ul><p>As therefore the Lord did nothing without the Father, being united to Him, neither by Himself nor by the apostles, so neither do ye anything without the bishop and presbyters. Neither endeavour that anything appear reasonable and proper to yourselves apart; but being come together into the same place, let there be one prayer, one supplication, one mind, one hope, in love and in joy undefiled. There is one Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is more excellent. Do ye therefore all run together as into one temple of God, as to one altar, as to one Jesus Christ, who came forth from one Father, and is with and has gone to one.</p>
<p>As therefore the Lord does nothing without the Father, for says He, "I can of mine own self do nothing,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1490_262158" id="P1490_262158" name="P1490_262158">43</a></sup> so do ye, neither presbyter, nor deacon, nor layman, do anything without the bishop. Nor let anything appear commendable to you which is destitute of his approval.<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1491_262339" id="P1491_262339" name="P1491_262339">44</a></sup> For every such thing is sinful, and opposed [to the will of] God. Do ye all come together into the same place for prayer. Let there be one common supplication, one mind, one hope, with faith unblameable in Christ Jesus, than which nothing is more excellent. Do ye all, as one man, run together into the temple of God, as unto one altar, to one Jesus Christ, the High Priest of the unbegotten God.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter VIII.-Caution Against False Doctrines.</font></p>
</ul><p>Be not deceived with strange doctrines, nor with old fables, which are unprofitable. For if we still live according to the Jewish law, we acknowledge that we have not received grace. For the divinest prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by His grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His eternal Word, not proceeding forth from silence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn14.htm#P1497_263300" id="P1497_263300" name="P1497_263300">45</a></sup> and who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</p>

For the divinest prophets lived according to Jesus Christ. On this account also they were persecuted, being inspired by grace to fully convince the unbelieving that there is one God, the Almighty, who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ His Son, who is His Word, not spoken, but essential. For He is not the voice of an articulate utterance, but a substance begotten by divine power, who has in all things pleased Him that sent Him.<sup><a href="footnote/fn15.htm#P1501_264312" id="P1501_264312" name="P1501_264312">48</a></sup> </p>

<p>If, then, those who were conversant with the ancient Scriptures came to newness of hope, expecting the coming of Christ, as the Lord teaches us when He says, "If ye had believed Moses, ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn15.htm#P1513_265443" id="P1513_265443" name="P1513_265443">54</a></sup> and again, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; for before Abraham was, I am; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn15.htm#P1514_265577" id="P1514_265577" name="P1514_265577">55</a></sup> how shall we be able to live without Him?
