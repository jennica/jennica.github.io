Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded to listen to me, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die. My love<sup><a href="footnote/fn18.htm#P1897_321884" id="P1897_321884" name="P1897_321884">48</a></sup> has been crucified, and there is no fire in me desiring to be fed;<sup><a href="footnote/fn18.htm#P1898_322081" id="P1898_322081" name="P1898_322081">49</a></sup> but there is within me a water that liveth and speaketh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn18.htm#P1899_322175" id="P1899_322175" name="P1899_322175">50</a></sup> saying to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life.</p>
<p>The prince of this world would fain carry me away, and corrupt my disposition towards God. Let none of you, therefore, who are [in Rome] help him; rather be ye on my side, that is, on the side of God. Do not speak of Jesus Christ, and yet prefer this world to Him. Let not envy find a dwelling-place among you; nor even should I, when present with you, exhort you to it, be ye persuaded, but rather give credit to those things which I now write to you. For though I am alive while I write to you, yet I am eager to die for the sake of Christ. My love<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1901_323255" id="P1901_323255" name="P1901_323255">51</a></sup> has been crucified, and there is no fire in me that loves anything; but there is living water springing up in me,<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1902_323499" id="P1902_323499" name="P1902_323499">52</a></sup> and which says to me inwardly, Come to the Father. I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life.

</ul><p>I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire shall be fulfilled if ye consent. Be ye willing, then, that ye also may have your desires fulfilled. I entreat you in this brief letter; do ye give credit to me. Jesus Christ will reveal these things to you, [so that ye shall know] that I speak truly. He<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1910_324266" id="P1910_324266" name="P1910_324266">53</a></sup> is the mouth altogether free from falsehood, by which the Father has truly spoken. Pray ye for me, that I may attain [the object of my desire]. I have not written to you according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall suffer, ye have wished [well] to me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.</p>
<p>I no longer wish to live after the manner of men, and my desire shall be fulfilled if ye consent.

And do ye pray along with me, that I may attain my aim in the Holy Spirit. I have not written to you according to the flesh, but according to the will of God. If I shall suffer, ye have loved me; but if I am rejected, ye have hated me.</p>

</ul><p>Remember in your prayers the Church in Syria, which now has God for its shepherd, instead of me. Jesus Christ alone will oversee it, and your love [will also regard it]. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for indeed I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time.<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1919_325769" id="P1919_325769" name="P1919_325769">56</a></sup> But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches that have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passer-by. For even those Churches which were not<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1920_326036" id="P1920_326036" name="P1920_326036">57</a></sup> near to me in the way, I mean according to the flesh,<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1921_326144" id="P1921_326144" name="P1921_326144">58</a></sup> have gone before me,<sup><a href="footnote/fn19.htm#P1922_326211" id="P1922_326211" name="P1922_326211">59</a></sup> city by city, [to meet me.]</p>
<p>Remember in your prayers the Church which is in Syria, which, instead of me, has now for its shepherd the Lord, who says, "I am the good Shepherd." And He alone will oversee it, as well as your love towards Him. But as for me, I am ashamed to be counted one of them; for I am not worthy, as being the very last of them, and one born out of due time. But I have obtained mercy to be somebody, if I shall attain to God. My spirit salutes you, and the love of the Churches which have received me in the name of Jesus Christ, and not as a mere passerby.
