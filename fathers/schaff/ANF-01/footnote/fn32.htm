<p><a name="P3200_538882"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>Isa. l. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P3201_538987"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Isa. l. 9.</p>
<p><a name="P3202_539038"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>The Latin omits "since," but it is found in all the Greek mss.</p>
<p><a name="P3203_539295"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "believe." Isa. viii. 14, xxviii. 16.</p>
<p><a name="P3204_539561"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>Isa. l. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P3205_539690"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>Ps. cxviii. 22.</p>
<p><a name="P3206_539793"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Ps. cxviii. 24.</p>
<p><a name="P3207_539908"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>Comp. 1 Cor. iv. 13. The meaning is, "My love to you is so great, that I am ready to be or to do all things for you."</p>
<p><a name="P3208_540155"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>Ps. xxii. 17, cxviii. 12.</p>
<p><a name="P3209_540224"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>Ps. xxii. 19.</p>
<p><a name="P3210_540472"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>Isa. iii. 9.</p>
<p><a name="P3211_540558"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>Wisd. ii. 12. This apocryphal book is thus quoted as Scripture, and intertwined with it.</p>
<p><a name="P3212_540681"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "What says the other prophet Moses unto them?"</p>
<p><a name="P3213_540938"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>Ex. xxxiii. 1; Lev. xx. 24.</p>
<p><a name="P3214_540999"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>The original word is "Gnosis," the knowledge peculiar to advanced Christians, by which they understand the mysteries of Scripture.</p>
<p><a name="P3215_541627"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>Not found in Scripture. Comp. Isa. xl. 13; Prov. i. 6. Hilgenfeld, however, changes the usual punctuation, which places a colon after prophet, and reads, "For the prophet speaketh the parable of the Lord. Who shall understand," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P3216_542085"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>The Greek is here very elliptical and obscure: "His Spirit" is inserted above, from the Latin.</p>
<p><a name="P3217_542419"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>Gen. i. 26.</p>
<p><a name="P3218_542486"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "our fair formation."</p>
<p><a name="P3219_542583"></a>
<sup>69 </sup>Gen. i. 28.</p>
<p><a name="P3220_542686"></a>
<sup>70 </sup>Cod. Sin. inserts, "the Lord says."</p>
<p><a name="P3221_542823"></a>
<sup>71 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "I make."</p>
<p><a name="P3222_542878"></a>
<sup>72 </sup>Not in Scripture, but comp. Matt. xx. 16, and 2 Cor. v. 17. </p>
<p><a name="P3223_543077"></a>
<sup>73 </sup>Ex. xxxiii. 3.</p>
<p><a name="P3224_543355"></a>
<sup>74 </sup>Ezek. xi. 19, xxxvi. 26.</p>
<p><a name="P3225_543396"></a>
<sup>75 </sup>Cod. Sin. inserts "Himself;" comp. John i. 14.</p>
<p><a name="P3226_543580"></a>
<sup>76 </sup>Comp. Eph. ii. 21.</p>
<p><a name="P3227_543704"></a>
<sup>77 </sup>Comp. Ps. xlii. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P3228_543737"></a>
<sup>78 </sup>Cod. Sin. omits "He says."</p>
<p><a name="P3229_543820"></a>
<sup>79 </sup>Cod. Sin. omits "in the midst."</p>
<p><a name="P3230_543941"></a>
<sup>80 </sup>Ps. xxii. 23; Heb. ii. 12.</p>
<p><a name="P3231_544275"></a>
<sup>81 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "But we said above."</p>
<p><a name="P3232_544362"></a>
<sup>82 </sup>Gen. i. 28.</p>
<p><a name="P3233_544741"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>These are specimens of the "Gnosis," or faculty of bringing out the hidden spiritual meaning of Scripture referred to before. Many more such interpretations follow.</p>
<p><a name="P3237_545504"></a>
<sup>84 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads "temple," which is adopted by Hilgenfeld.</p>
<p><a name="P3238_546035"></a>
<sup>85 </sup>Not to be found in Scripture, as is the case also with what follows. Hefele remarks, that "certain false traditions respecting the Jewish rites seem to have prevailed among the Christians of the second century, of which Barnabas here adopts some, as do Justin (<i>Dial. c. Try. </i>40) and Tertullian (<i>adv. Fud. 14; adv. Marc.</i> iii. 7)."</p>
<p><a name="P3239_546749"></a>
<sup>86 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "by them."</p>
<p><a name="P3240_546784"></a>
<sup>87 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "what commanded He?"</p>
<p><a name="P3241_547009"></a>
<sup>88 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "one as a burnt-offering, and one for sins."</p>
<p><a name="P3242_547178"></a>
<sup>89 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "type of God," but it has been corrected to "Jesus."</p>
<p><a name="P3243_547569"></a>
<sup>90 </sup>In Cod. Sin. we find "<i>Rachel</i>." The orthography is doubtful, but there is little question that a kind of bramble-bush is intended.</p>
<p><a name="P3244_547754"></a>
<sup>91 </sup>Thus the Latin interprets: others render "shoots."</p>
<p><a name="P3245_547850"></a>
<sup>92 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "thus" instead of "this."</p>
<p><a name="P3246_548304"></a>
<sup>93 </sup>Literally, "was."</p>
<p><a name="P3247_548405"></a>
<sup>94 </sup>The text is here in great confusion, though the meaning is plain. Dressel reads, "For how are they alike, and why [does He enjoin] that the goats should be good and alike?" The Cod. Sin. reads, "How is He like Him? For this that," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P3248_548827"></a>
<sup>95 </sup>Cod. Sin. here inserts "the goat." </p>
<p><a name="P3249_549031"></a>
<sup>96 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "for as he who . . . so, says he," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P3250_549415"></a>
<sup>97 </sup>Comp. Acts xiv. 22.</p>
<p><a name="P3254_549604"></a>
<sup>98 </sup>Literally, "men in whom sins are perfect." Of this, and much more that follows, no mention is made in Scripture.</p>
<p><a name="P3255_549861"></a>
<sup>99 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "upon sticks," and adds, "Behold again the type of the cross, both the scarlet wool and the hyssop,"-adopted by Hilgenfeld.</p>
<p><a name="P3256_550209"></a>
<sup>100 </sup>Cod. Sin. has, "the law is Christ Jesus," corrected to the above.</p>
<p><a name="P3257_550432"></a>
<sup>101 </sup>The Greek text is,"then no longer [sinful] men, no longer the glory of sinners," which Dressel defends and Hilgenfeld adopts, but which is surely corrupt.</p>
<p><a name="P3258_550815"></a>
<sup>102 </sup>Literally, "in witness of the tribes."</p>
<p><a name="P3259_550930"></a>
<sup>103 </sup>"In witness of."</p>
<p><a name="P3260_551376"></a>
<sup>104 </sup>Thus the sense seems to require, and thus Dressel translates, though it is difficult to extract such a meaning from the Greek text.</p>
<p><a name="P3264_551882"></a>
<sup>105 </sup>Ps. xviii. 44.</p>
<p><a name="P3265_552007"></a>
<sup>106 </sup>Isa. xxxiii. 13.</p>
<p><a name="P3266_552088"></a>
<sup>107 </sup>Jer. iv. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P3267_552185"></a>
<sup>108 </sup>Jer. vii. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P3268_552344"></a>
<sup>109 </sup>Ps. xxxiv. 11-13. The first clause of this sentence is wanting in Cod. Sin.</p>
<p><a name="P3269_552495"></a>
<sup>110 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "Lord."</p>
<p><a name="P3270_552538"></a>
<sup>111 </sup>Isa. i. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P3271_552576"></a>
<sup>112 </sup>In proof of the spiritual meaning of circumcision; but Hilgenfeld joins the words to the preceding sentence.</p>
<p><a name="P3272_552767"></a>
<sup>113 </sup>Isa. i. 10.</p>
<p><a name="P3273_552870"></a>
<sup>114 </sup>Cod. Sin. reads, "it is the voice," corrected, however, as above.</p>
<p><a name="P3274_553081"></a>
<sup>115 </sup>Cod. Sin. has, "that we might hear the word, and not only believe," plainly a corrupt text.</p>
<p><a name="P3275_553294"></a>
<sup>116 </sup>Cod. Sin., at first hand, has "slew them," but is corrected as above.</p>
<p><a name="P3276_553434"></a>
<sup>117 </sup>The meaning is here very obscure, but the above rendering and punctuation seem preferable to any other.</p>
<p><a name="P3277_553558"></a>
<sup>118 </sup>Cod. Sin., with several other mss., leaves out "new."</p>
<p><a name="P3278_553695"></a>
<sup>119 </sup>Jer. iv. 3. Cod. Sin. has "God" instead of "Lord."</p>
<p><a name="P3279_553849"></a>
<sup>120 </sup>Deut. x. 16.</p>
<p><a name="P3280_553939"></a>
<sup>121 </sup>This contrast seems to be marked in the original. cod. Sin. has, "Behold, receive again."</p>
<p><a name="P3281_554095"></a>
<sup>122 </sup>Jer. ix. 25, 26.</p>
<p><a name="P3282_554312"></a>
<sup>123 </sup>Dressel and Hilgenfeld read, "their covenant," as does Cod. Sin.; we have followed Hefele.</p>
<p><a name="P3283_554512"></a>
<sup>124 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "children of love," omitting "richly," and inserting it before "looking forward."</p>
<p><a name="P3284_554753"></a>
<sup>125 </sup>Literally, "doctrines." </p>
<p><a name="P3285_554916"></a>
<sup>126 </sup>Not found in Scripture: but comp. Gen. xvii. 26, 27, xiv. 14.</p>
<p><a name="P3286_555091"></a>
<sup>127 </sup>Cod. Sin. inserts, "and then making a pause."</p>
<p><a name="P3287_555209"></a>
<sup>128 </sup>This sentence is altogether omitted by inadvertence in Cod. Sin.</p>
<p><a name="P3288_555340"></a>
<sup>129 </sup>Some mss. here read, "and further:" the above is the reading in Cod. Sin., and is also that of Hefele.</p>
<p><a name="P3289_555673"></a>
<sup>130 </sup>This is rendered in the Latin, "the more profound gift," referring, as it does, to the <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Gnosis</font></i> of the initiated. The same word is used in chap. i.</p>
<p><a name="P3290_555918"></a>
<sup>131 </sup>Literally, "has learned a more germane (or genuine) word from me," being an idle vaunt on account of the ingenuity in interpreting Scripture he has just displayed.</p>
<p><a name="P3294_556378"></a>
<sup>132 </sup>Cod. Sin. has "portion," corrected, however, as above. See Lev. xi. and Deut. xiv.</p>
<p><a name="P3295_556628"></a>
<sup>133 </sup>Deut. iv. 1.</p>
<p><a name="P3296_556773"></a>
<sup>134 </sup>Literally, "in spirit."</p>
<p><a name="P3297_557519"></a>
<sup>135 </sup>Cod. Sin. inserts, "and gaze about for some way of escape on account of their greediness, even as these birds alond do not procure food for themselves (by labour), but sitting idle, seek to devour the flesh of others." The text as above seems preferable: Hilgenfeld, however, follows the Greek.</p>
<p><a name="P3298_558154"></a>
<sup>136 </sup>Cod. Sin. has, "condemned already."</p>
<p><a name="P3299_558503"></a>
<sup>137 </sup>Dressel has a note upon this passage, in which he refers the words we have rendered, "corrupters of boys," to those who by their dissolute lives waste their fortunes, and so entail destruction on their children; but this does not appear satisfactory. Comp. Clem. Alex. <i>Paedag</i>. ii. 10.</p>
