<sup>348 </sup>Grabe and others suppose that some part of the work has been lost, so that the above was not its original conclusion. </p>
<p><a name="P9442_2768680"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>This fragment is quoted by Eusebius, <i>Hist. Eccl</i>., v. 20. It occurred at the close of the lost treatise of Irenaeus entitled <i>De Ogdoade</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P9446_2769157"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>This interesting extract we also owe to Eusebius, who (<i>ut sup.</i>) took it from the work <i>De Ogdoade</i>, written after this former friend of Irenaeus had lapsed to Valentinianism. Florinus had previously held that God was the author of evil, which sentiment Irenaeus opposed in a treatise, now lost, called <font face="SPIonic">peri monarxiaj</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P9447_2769974"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Comp. p. 32, this volume, and Phil. iv. 22.</p>
<p><a name="P9451_2771719"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>See pp. 31 and 312, of this volume. We are indebted again to Eusebius for this valuable fragment from the Epistle of Irenaeus to Victor Bishop of Rome (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i>, v. 24; copied also by Nicephorus, iv. 39). It appears to have been a synodical epistle to the head of the Roman Church, the historian saying that it was written by Irenaeus, "in the name of (<font face="SPIonic">ek proswpon</font>) those brethren over whom he ruled throughout Gaul." Neither are these expressions to be limited to the Church at Lyons, for the same authority records (v. 23) that it was the testimony "of the dioceses throughout Gaul, which Irenaeus superintended" (Harvey).</p>
<p><a name="P9452_2772449"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>According to Harvey, the early paschal controversy resolved itself into two particulars: (<i>a</i>) as regards the precise day on which our Lord's resurrection should be celebrated; (<i>b</i>) as regards the custom of the feast preceding it.</p>
<p><a name="P9453_2772889"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Both reading and punctuation are here subjects of controversy. We have followed Massuet and Harvey. </p>
<p><a name="P9454_2773508"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>"The observance of <i>a</i> day, though not everywhere the same, showed unity, so far as faith in the Lord's resurrection was concerned."-Harvey.</p>
<p><a name="P9455_2773888"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Following the reading of Rufinus, the ordinary test has <font face="SPIonic">met0 autouj</font>, i.e., after them.</p>
<p><a name="P9456_2774500"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>This practice was afterwards forbidden by the Council of Laodicea [held about A.D. 360].</p>
<p><a name="P9457_2775679"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>It was perhaps in reference to this pleasing episode in the annals of the Church, that the Council of Arles, A. D. 314, decreed that the holy Eucharist should be consecrated by any foreign bishop present at its celebration.</p>
<p><a name="P9461_2775914"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>Quoted by Maximus Bishop of Turin, A.D. 422, <i>Serm</i>. vii. <i>de Eleemos</i>., as from the Epistle to Pope Victor. It is also found in some other ancient writers.</p>
<p><a name="P9462_2776212"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>One of the mss.MSS; . reads here <font face="SPIonic">tou Qeou</font>, of God.</p>
<p><a name="P9466_2776274"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>Also quoted by Maximus Turinensis, <i>Op</i>. ii. 152, who refers it to Irenaeus's <i>Sermo de Fide</i>, which work, not being referred bo by Eusebius or Jerome, causes Massuet to doubt the authenticity of the fragment. Harvey, however, accepts it.</p>
<p><a name="P9470_2776947"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>We owe this fragment also to Maximus, who quoted it from the same work, <i>de Fide</i>, written by Irenaeus to Demetrius, a deacon of Vienne. This and the last fragment were first printed by Feuardentius, who obtained them from Faber; no reference, however, being given as to the source from whence the Latin version was derived. The Greek of the Fragment vi. is not extant.</p>
<p><a name="P9474_2778284"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Taken from a work (<i>Quaes. et Resp. ad Othod</i>.) ascribed to Justin Martyr, but certainly written after the Nicene Council. It is evident that this is not an exact quotation from Irenaeus, but a summary of his words. The "Sunday" here referred to must be Easter Sunday. Massuet's emendation of the text has been adopted, <font face="SPIonic">ep autou</font> for <font face="SPIonic">ap autwn</font>. </p>
<p><a name="P9478_2779183"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>Cited by Leontius of Byzantium, who flourished about the year A.D. 600; but he does not mention the writing of Irenaeus from which it is extracted. Massuet conjectures that it is from the <i>De Ogdoade</i>, addressed to the apostate Florinus.</p>
<p><a name="P9482_2779729"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>This fragment and the next three are from the <i>Parallela</i> of John of Damascus. Frag. ix. x. xii. seem to be quotations from the treatise of Irenaeus on the resurrection. No. xi. is extracted from his <i>Miscellaneous Dissertations</i>, a work mentioned by Eusebius, <font face="SPIonic">biblion ti dialecewn diaforwn</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P9486_2780387"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>Ps. cxxx. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P9493_2781680"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>This sentence in the original seems incomplete; we have followed the conjectural restoration of Harvey.</p>
<p><a name="P9497_2782140"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>"This extract is found in (Ecumenius upon 1 Pet. c. iii. p. 198; and the words used by him indicate, as Grabe has justly observed, that he only condensed a longer passage."-Harvey.</p>
