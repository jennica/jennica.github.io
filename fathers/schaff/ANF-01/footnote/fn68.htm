<p><a name="P6800_1676880"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>Dan. vii. 10, agreeing neither with the Greek nor Hebrew text.</p>
<p><a name="P6801_1676965"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>This clause is exceedingly obscure. Harvey remarks upon it as follows: "The reasoning of Irenaeus seems to be this: According to the Gnostic theory, the Aeons and angels of the Pleroma were homogeneous. They were also the archetypes of things created. But things created are heterogeneous: therefore either these Aeons are heterogeneous, which is contrary to theory, or things created are homogeneous, which is contrary to fact."</p>
<p><a name="P6803_1677863"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Literally, "from Himself." </p>
<p><a name="P6811_1683716"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>See above, chap. ii. and v.</p>
<p><a name="P6812_1683967"></a>
<sup>39 </sup>The text has <i>fabricasse</i>, for which, says Massuet, should be read <i>fabricatam esse</i>; or <i>fabricasse</i> itself must be taken in a passive signification. It is possible, however, to translate, as Harvey indicates, "that He (Bythus) formed so great a creation by angels," etc., though this seems harsh and unsuitable.</p>
<p><a name="P6813_1685019"></a>
<sup>40 </sup>Literally, <i>empty</i>: there is a play on the words <i>vacuum</i> and <i>vacui</i> (which immediately follows), as there had been in the original Greek.</p>
<p><a name="P6817_1685679"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>Comp. e.g., Matt. v. 16, v. 45, vi. 9, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P6819_1686957"></a>
<sup>42 </sup>See chap xxiii. etc.</p>
<p><a name="P6820_1687151"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>Viz., the Valentinians.</p>
<p><a name="P6821_1687335"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>Rom. i. 25.</p>
<p><a name="P6822_1687384"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>Gal. iv. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P6823_1687774"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>Isa. xlvi. 9. </p>
<p><a name="P6828_1690406"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>This clause is unintelligible in the Latin text: by a conjectural restoration of the Greek we have given the above translation.</p>
<p><a name="P6831_1692634"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>Luke xviii. 27.</p>
<p><a name="P6835_1693881"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>Playing upon the doctrines of the heretics with respect to <i>vacuity</i> and <i>shade</i>. </p>
<p><a name="P6840_1695879"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>The text vacillates between "dicemus" and "dicamus."</p>
<p><a name="P6842_1698171"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>This sentence is confused in the Latin text, but the meaning is evidently that given above. </p>
<p><a name="P6844_1700553"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>It is difficult to see the meaning of "iterum" here. Harvey begins a new paragraph with this sentence.</p>
<p><a name="P6847_1702465"></a>
<sup>53 </sup><font face="SPIonic">endiaqetoj</font>-simply <i>conceived</i> in the mind-used in opposition to <font face="SPIonic">proforikoj</font>, <i>expressed</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P6850_1704040"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>Harvey remarks that "the author perhaps wrote <font face="SPIonic">Oron</font> (<i><font face="Semitica Dict">Horos</font></i>), which was read by the translator" <font face="SPIonic">Olon</font> (<i><font face="Semitica Dict">totum</font></i>).</p>
<p><a name="P6851_1704826"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>Since <i>Soter</i> does not occur among the various appellations of Horos mentioned by Irenaeus (i. 11, 4), Grabe proposes to read <i>Stauros</i>, and Massuet <i>Lytrotes</i>; but Harvey conceives that the difficulty is explained by the fact that Horos was a <i>power</i> of Soter (i. 3, 3). </p>
<p><a name="P6853_1706357"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Irenaeus here, after his custom, plays upon the word <i>Bythus</i> (profundity), which, in the phraseology of the Valentinians, was a name of the Propator, but is in this passage used to denote <i>an unfathomable abyss</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P6857_1708233"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>This sentence appears to us, after long study, totally untranslateable. The general meaning seems to be, that whatever name is given to mental acts, whether they are called<i> <font face="Semitica Dict">Enn√¶a</font>,</i> <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Enthymesis</font></i>, or by whatever other appellation, they are all but exercises of the same fundamental power, styled <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Nous</font></i>. Compare the following section.</p>
<p><a name="P6859_1709596"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>"The following," says Harvey, "may be considered to be consecutive steps in the evolution of <font face="SPIonic">logoj</font> as a psychological entity. Ennoea, <i>conception</i>; Enthymesis, <i>intention</i>; Sensation, <i>thought</i>; Consilium, <i>reasoning</i>; Cogitationis Examinatio, <i>judgment</i>; in Mente Perseverans, <font face="SPIonic">Logoj endiaqetoj</font>; Emissibile Verbum, <font face="SPIonic">Logoj profoikoj</font>." </p>
<p><a name="P6861_1711711"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>That is, lest He should be thought destitute of power, as having been unable to prevent evil from having a place in creation.</p>
<p><a name="P6862_1712115"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>Isa. lv. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P6863_1712297"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>The Latin expression is "similimembrius," which some regard as the translation of <font face="SPIonic">omoikwloj</font>, and others of <font face="SPIonic">omoiomerhj</font>; but in either case the meaning will be as given above.</p>
<p><a name="P6865_1713735"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>That is, <font face="Semitica Dict">His Nous, Ennoea</font>, etc., can have no independent existence. The text fluctuates between "emittitur" and "emittetur." </p>
<p><a name="P6870_1719727"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>That is, in human beings no doubt, <i>thought</i> (<font face="Semitica Dict">Nous</font>) precedes <i>speech</i> (<font face="Semitica Dict">Logos</font>). </p>
<p><a name="P6873_1723793"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>Matt. vii. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P6877_1724234"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>Nothing is known of this writer. Several of the same name are mentioned by the ancients, but to none of them is a work named <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Theogonia</font></i> ascribed. He is supposed to be the same poet as is cited by Athenaeus, but that writer quotes from a work styled <font face="SPIonic">'Afrodithj gonai</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P6878_1724676"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>The Latin is "Cupidinem;" and Harvey here refers to Aristotle, who "quotes the authority of Hesiod and Parmenides as saying that Love is the eternal intellect, reducing Chaos into order."</p>
<p><a name="P6880_1727113"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>Compare, on the opinions of the philosophers referred to in this chapter, Hippolytus, <i>Philosoph.</i>, book i.</p>
<p><a name="P6881_1727389"></a>
<sup>68 </sup><i>Iliad</i>, xiv. 201; vii. 99. </p>
<p><a name="P6883_1729385"></a>
<sup>69 </sup>The Latin has here <i>exemplum</i>, corresponding doubtless to <font face="SPIonic">paradeigma</font>, and referring to those <font face="SPIonic">ideai</font> of all things which Plato supposed to have existed for ever in the divine mind.</p>
<p><a name="P6885_1730580"></a>
<sup>70 </sup>[Our author's demonstration of the essential harmony of Gnosticism with the old mythologies, and the philodophies of the heathen, explains the hold it seems to have gained among nominal converts to Christianity, and also the necessity for a painstaking refutation of what seem to us mere absurdities. The great merit of Irenaeus is thus illustrated: he gave the death-blow to heathenism in extirpating heresy.]</p>
<p><a name="P6888_1732790"></a>
<sup>71 </sup>The Latin text reads "sensibilia et insensata;" but these words, as Harvey observes, must be the translation of <font face="SPIonic">aisqhra kai anaisqhta</font>,-"the former referring to material objects of sense, the latter to the immaterial world of intellect."</p>
<p><a name="P6889_1733118"></a>
<sup>72 </sup>This clause is very obscure, and we are not sure if the above rendering brings out the real meaning of the author. Harvey takes a different vies of it, and supposes the original Greek to have been, <font face="SPIonic">kai allaj men thj upostasewj arxaj einai allaj de thj aisqhsewj kai thj ousiaj</font>. He then remarks: "The reader will observe that the word <font face="SPIonic">upostasij</font> here means intellectual substance, <font face="SPIonic">ousia</font> <i>material;</i> as in V. <i>c. ult</i>. The meaning therefore of the sentence will be, <i>And they affirmed that the first principles of intellectual substance and of sensible and material existence were diverse</i>, viz., unity was the exponent of the first, duality of the second."</p>
<p><a name="P6890_1734086"></a>
<sup>73 </sup>All the editors confess the above sentence hopelessly obscure. We have given Harvey's conjectural translation. </p>
<p><a name="P6892_1735805"></a>
<sup>74 </sup>Literally, "antiphrasis."</p>
<p><a name="P6893_1735988"></a>
<sup>75 </sup>1 Tim.vi. 20. The text is, "Vocum novitates falsae agnitionis," <font face="SPIonic">kainofwniaj</font> having apparently been read in the Greek instead of <font face="SPIonic">kenofwniaj</font> as in Text. Rec.</p>
<p><a name="P6894_1736351"></a>
<sup>76 </sup>Grabe and others insert "vel" between these words.</p>
<p><a name="P6895_1736945"></a>
<sup>77 </sup>It seems necessary to regard these words as parenthetical, though the point is overlooked by all the editors.</p>
<p><a name="P6896_1737173"></a>
<sup>78 </sup>Matt. xi. 27.</p>
<p><a name="P6898_1738607"></a>
<sup>79 </sup>"Decem" is of doubtful authority.</p>
