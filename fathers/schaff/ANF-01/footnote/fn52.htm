<sup>544 </sup>Ps. xxxii. 2.</p>

<sup>545 </sup>The last sentence is very dubious. For <font face="SPIonic">panti anqrwpinon noun</font> read <font face="SPIonic">panti anqrwpw ton noun</font>. For <font face="SPIonic">poihshte</font> read <font face="SPIonic">pisteushte</font>. And lastly, for <font face="SPIonic">to hmwn</font> read <font face="SPIonic">ton Ihsoun</font>.[But there is no doubt about the touching beauty of this close; and truly Trypho seems "not far from the kingdom of God."

<p><a name="P5225_1200136"></a>
<sup>550 </sup>Or, Saturn son of Heaven.</p>
<p><a name="P5226_1200755"></a>
<sup>551 </sup>In the mysteries of Eleusis, the return of Proserpine from the lower world was celebrated.</p>
<p><a name="P5227_1201575"></a>
<sup>552 </sup>Apollo accidentally killed Hyacinthus by striking him on the head with a quoit. </p>
<p><a name="P5231_1202326"></a>
<sup>553 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Triesperon</font>, so called, as some think, [from his origin: "<i>ex concubitu trium noctium.</i>"]</p>
<p><a name="P5232_1203813"></a>
<sup>554 </sup>Thyestes seduced the wife of his brother Atreus, whence the tragic career of the family.</p>
<p><a name="P5233_1204094"></a>
<sup>555 </sup>There is no apodosis in the Greek.</p>
<p><a name="P5234_1204294"></a>
<sup>556 </sup>Not, as the editors dispute, either the tongue of the buckle with which he put out his eyes, nor the awl with which his heels were bored through, but the goad with which he killed his father.</p>

<sup>4 </sup>That is, Venus, who, after Paris had sworn that the war should be decided by single combat between himself and Menekaus, carried him off, and induced him, though defeated, to refuse performance of the articles agreed upon.</p>
<p><a name="P5263_1210490"></a>
