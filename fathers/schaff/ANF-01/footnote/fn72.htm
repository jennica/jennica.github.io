<sup>264 </sup>Or, "the Scriptures of the Lord;" but the words "dominicis scripturis" probably here represent the Greek <font face="SPIonic">kuriwn grafwn</font>, and are to be rendered as above.</p>
<p><a name="P7204_1890521"></a>
<sup>265 </sup>2 Cor. xii. 2, 3, 4.</p>
<p><a name="P7205_1890898"></a>
<sup>266 </sup>"Inciperet fieri;" perhaps for "futurus esset," <i>was to be</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P7206_1891374"></a>
<sup>267 </sup>"Quartum coelum;" there still being, according to their theory of seven heavens, a <i>fourth</i> beyond that to which St. Paul had penetrated.</p>
<p><a name="P7207_1893055"></a>
<sup>268 </sup>2 Cor. xii. 3, defectively quoted.</p>
<p><a name="P7208_1893169"></a>
<sup>269 </sup>This is an exceedingly obscure and difficult sentence. Grabe and some of the later editors read, "uti neque <i>non</i> corpus," thus making Irenaeus affirm that the body <i>did</i> participate in the vision. But Massuet contends strenuously that this is contrary to the author's purpose, as wishing to maintain, against a possible exception of the Valentinians, that Paul then witnessed <i>spiritual</i> realities, and by omitting this "non" before "corpus," makes Irenaeus deny that the body was a partaker in the vision. The point can only be doubtfully decided, but Massuet's ingenious note inclines us to his side of the question. </p>
<p><a name="P7210_1894561"></a>
<sup>270 </sup>"Praestat dignid:" here a very ambiguous expression.</p>
<p><a name="P7212_1896697"></a>
<sup>271 </sup>That is, as Massuet notes, all things derive not only their <i>existence</i>, but their <i>qualities</i>, from His will. Harvey proposes to read <i>causa</i> instead of <i>substantia</i>, but the change seems needless.</p>
<p><a name="P7213_1897197"></a>
<sup>272 </sup>Heb. i. 3.</p>
<p><a name="P7214_1897790"></a>
<sup>273 </sup>That is, <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Barbelos</font></i>: comp. i. 29, 1.</p>
<p><a name="P7215_1898615"></a>
<sup>274 </sup>"Tradunt;" literally,<i> hand down</i>. </p>
<p><a name="P7219_1901331"></a>
<sup>275 </sup><i>Qui</i>, though here found in all the mss.MSS;., seems to have been rightly expunged by the editors.</p>
<p><a name="P7220_1901475"></a>
<sup>276 </sup>The reference probably is to opinions and theories of the heathen.</p>
<p><a name="P7222_1903846"></a>
<sup>277 </sup>Comp. 2 Tim. ii. 17, 18. [On the sub-apostolic age and this subject of miracles, Newman, in spite of his sophistical argumentation, may well be consulted for his references, etc. <i>Translation of the Abbe Fleury</i>, p. xi. Oxford, 1842.]</p>
<p><a name="P7224_1904429"></a>
<sup>278 </sup>"Perficiatur:" it is difficult here to give a fitting translation of this word. Some prefer to read "impertiatur."</p>
<p><a name="P7225_1905112"></a>
<sup>279 </sup>Rev. xii. 14. </p>
<p><a name="P7229_1906093"></a>
<sup>280 </sup>Matt. v. 21, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P7230_1908186"></a>
<sup>281 </sup>Matt. xiii. 43.</p>
<p><a name="P7231_1908386"></a>
<sup>282 </sup>Matt. xxv. 41; Mark ix. 44.</p>
<p><a name="P7233_1908511"></a>
<sup>283 </sup>Comp. i. 25, 4.</p>
<p><a name="P7234_1908821"></a>
<sup>284 </sup>"Artificialia." </p>
<p><a name="P7236_1911511"></a>
<sup>285 </sup>"Pureos investes," boys that have not yet reached the age of puberty.</p>
<p><a name="P7237_1911748"></a>
<sup>286 </sup>The text has "stillicidio temporis," literally " a drop of tim" (<font face="SPIonic">stagmh xronou</font>); but the original text was perhaps <font face="SPIonic">stigmh xronon</font>, "a moment of time." With either reading the meaning is the same.</p>
<p><a name="P7238_1912037"></a>
<sup>287 </sup>Some have deemed the words "firmum esse" an interpolation.</p>
<p><a name="P7240_1912619"></a>
<sup>288 </sup>That is, as being done <i>in reality</i>, and not in appearance.</p>
<p><a name="P7241_1913439"></a>
<sup>289 </sup>Harvey here notes: "The reader will not fail to remark this highly interesting testimony, that the divine <font face="SPIonic">xarismata</font> bestowed upon the infant Church were not wholly extinct in the days of Irenaeus. Possibly the venerable Father is speaking from his own personal recollection of some who had been raised from the dead, and had continued for a time living witnesses of the efficacy of Christian faith." [See cap. xxxi., <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P7242_1914250"></a>
<sup>290 </sup>Comp. Acts viii. 9, 18.</p>
<p><a name="P7243_1914370"></a>
<sup>291 </sup>Matt. x. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P7245_1914507"></a>
<sup>292 </sup>Grabe contends that these words imply that no invocations of angels, good or bad, were practised in the primitive Church. Massuet, on the other hand, maintains that the words of Irenaeus are plainly to be restricted to evil spirits, and have no bearing on the general question of angelic invocation.</p>
<p><a name="P7246_1915063"></a>
<sup>293 </sup>We follow the common reading, "perfecit;" but one ms. has "perficit," <i>works</i>, which suits the context better.</p>
<p><a name="P7247_1915579"></a>
<sup>294 </sup>We insert "et," in accordance with Grabe's suggestion.</p>
<p><a name="P7251_1916683"></a>
<sup>295 </sup>Harvey thinks that this parenthesis has fallen out of its proper place, and would insert it immediately after the opening period of the chapter. </p>
<p><a name="P7253_1917796"></a>
<sup>296 </sup>It is a mistake of Irenaeus to say that the doctine of metempsychosis originated with Plato: it was first publicly taught by Pythagoras, who learned it from the Egyptians. Comp. Clem. Alex., <i>Strom</i>., i. 15: Herodot., ii. 123.</p>
<p><a name="P7255_1920340"></a>
<sup>297 </sup>"In hominem conversi," literally, "returning into man."</p>
<p><a name="P7257_1920895"></a>
<sup>298 </sup>"Possidet." Massuet supposes this word to represent <font face="SPIonic">kurieuei</font>, "rules over" and Stieren <font face="SPIonic">kratunei</font>, <i>governs</i>; while Harvey thinks the whole clause corresponds to <font face="SPIonic">kratei kai kurieuei tou swmatoj</font>, which we have rendered above.</p>
<p><a name="P7259_1922303"></a>
<sup>299 </sup>Literally, <i>none of things past.</i> </p>
<p><a name="P7260_1923633"></a>
<sup>300 </sup>The Latin text is here very confused, but the Greek original of the greater part of this section has happily been preserved. [This Father here anticipates in outline many ideas which St. Augustine afterwards corrected and elaborated.]</p>
<p><a name="P7264_1924147"></a>
<sup>301 </sup>Grabe refers to Tertullian, <i>De Anima</i>, ch. vii., as making a similiar statement. Massuet, on the other hand, denies that Irenaeus here expresses an opinion like that of Tertullian in the passage referred to, and thinks that the special form (<i>character</i>) mentioned is to be understood as simply denoting individual <i>spiritual</i> properties. But his remarks are not satisfactory.</p>
<p><a name="P7265_1924854"></a>
<sup>302 </sup>Luke xvi. 19, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P7266_1925421"></a>
<sup>303 </sup>With Massuet and Stieren, we here supply <i>esse</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P7267_1925504"></a>
<sup>304 </sup>Some read <i>resurgeret</i>, and others <i>resurrexerit</i>; we deem the former reading preferable.</p>
<p><a name="P7270_1927782"></a>
<sup>305 </sup>Ps. cxlviii. 5, 6.</p>
<p><a name="P7271_1927947"></a>
<sup>306 </sup>Ps. xxi. 4. </p>
<p><a name="P7272_1928573"></a>
<sup>307 </sup>As Massuet observes, this statement is to be understood in harmony with the repeated assertion of Irenaeus that the wicked will exist in misery for ever. It refers not annihilation, but to deprivation of happiness.</p>
<p><a name="P7273_1928986"></a>
<sup>308 </sup>Luke xvi. 11, quoted loosely from memory. Grabe, however, thinks they are cited from the apocryphal Gospel according to the Egyptians.</p>
<p><a name="P7275_1929458"></a>
<sup>309 </sup>Comp. Justin Martyr, <i>Dial. c. Tryph</i>., ch. vi.</p>
<p><a name="P7276_1929658"></a>
<sup>310 </sup>Gen. ii. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P7280_1930939"></a>
<sup>311 </sup><i>Ex defluxu</i>, corresponding to <font face="SPIonic">ec aporroiaj</font> in the Greek.</p>
<p><a name="P7283_1932522"></a>
<sup>312 </sup><i>Eloae</i> here occurs in the Latin text, but Harvey supposes that the Greek had been <font face="SPIonic">Elweim</font>. He also remarks that <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Eloeuth</font></i> (<font face="SPTiberian">tkahl)</font></p>
<p>) is the rabbinical abstract term, <i>Godhead</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P7284_1932847"></a>
<sup>313 </sup>All that can be remarked on this is, that the Jews substituted the term <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Adonai</font></i> (<font face="SPTiberian">ynd)</font></p>
<p>) for the name <i>Jehovah</i>, as often as the latter occurred in the sacred text. The former might therefore be styled <i>nameable</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P7285_1933173"></a>
<sup>314 </sup>The Latin text is, "aliquando autem duplicata litera delta cum aspiratione," and Harvey supposes that the doubling of the Daleth would give "to the scarcely articulate <font face="SPTiberian">)</font></p>
<p> a more decidedly guttural character;" but the sense is extremely doubtful.</p>
<p><a name="P7286_1933567"></a>
<sup>315 </sup>Instead of "nec posteaquam insurgere," Feuardent and Massuet read "ne possit insurgere," and include the clause in the definition of <i>Addonai.</i></p>
<p><a name="P7287_1933768"></a>
<sup>316 </sup>The author is here utterly mistaken, and, notwithstanding Harvey's earnest claim for him of a knowledge of Hebrew, seems clearly to betray his ignorance of that language. The term <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Sabaoth</font></i> is never written with an Omicron, either in the LXX. or by the Greek Fathers, but always with an Omega (<font face="SPIonic">Sabawq</font>). Although Harvey remarks in his preface, that "It is hoped the Hebrew attainments of Irenaeus will no longer be denied," there appears enough, in the etymologies and explanations of Hebrew terms given in this chapter by the venerable Father, to prevent such a conclusion; and Massuet's observation on the passage seems not improbable, when he says, "Sciolus quispiam Irenaeo nostro, in Hebraicis haud satis perito, hic fucum ecisse videtur."</p>
<p><a name="P7288_1934766"></a>
<sup>317 </sup>Probably corresponding to the Hebrew term <i>Jehovah</i> (<font face="SPTiberian">hwhy</font></p>
<p><a name="P7289_1935087"></a>
<sup>318 </sup>Literally, "belong to one and the same name."</p>
<p><a name="P7290_1935205"></a>
<sup>319 </sup>"Secundum <i>Latinitatem</i>" in the text.</p>
<p><a name="P7292_1935737"></a>
<sup>320 </sup>The words are "apostolorum dictatio," probably referring to the <i>letters</i> of the apostles, as distinguished from their <i>preaching</i> already mentioned.</p>
<p><a name="P7293_1937114"></a>
<sup>321 </sup>This last sentence is very confused and ambiguous, and the editors throw but little light upon it. We have endeavoured to translate it according to the ordinary text and punctuation, but strongly suspect interpolation and corruption. If we might venture to strike out "has Scripturas," and connect "his tamen" with "praedicantibus," a better sense would be yielded, as follows: "But that I may not be thought to avoid that series of proofs which may be derived from the Scriptures of the Lord (since, indeed, these Scriptures to much more evidently and clearly set forth this very point, to those at least who do not bring a depraved mind to their consideration), I shall devote the particular book which follows to them, and shall," etc. </p>
