<p><a name="P6600_1567118"></a>
<sup>281 </sup>Acts viii. 20, 21, 23. </p>
<p><a name="P6601_1567613"></a>
<sup>282 </sup>Comp. Just. Mart., <i>Apol</i>., i. 26. It is generally supposed that Simon Magus was thus confounded with the Sabine god, Semo Sancus; but see our note, <i>loc. cit.</i> [And mine at end of the First Apology. Consult <i>Orelli's Inscriptions</i> there noted.]</p>
<p><a name="P6603_1569620"></a>
<sup>283 </sup>A lyric poet of Sicily, said to have been dealt with, as stated above, by Castor and Pollus.</p>
<p><a name="P6604_1570065"></a>
<sup>284 </sup>Matt. xviii. 12.</p>
<p><a name="P6607_1572057"></a>
<sup>285 </sup>1 Tim. vi. 20. </p>
<p><a name="P6612_1573663"></a>
<sup>286 </sup>Gen. i. 26.</p>
<p><a name="P6614_1574995"></a>
<sup>287 </sup>[1 Tim. iv. 3.]</p>
<p><a name="P6616_1576351"></a>
<sup>288 </sup>The ordinary text reads, "three hundred and seventy-five," but it should manifestly be corrected as above. </p>
<p><a name="P6619_1579671"></a>
<sup>289 </sup>This sentence is wholly unintelligible as it stands in the Latin version. Critics differ greatly as to its meaning; Harvey tries to bring out of it something like the translation given above. [This name is manufactured from a curious abuse of (<font face="SPTiberian">wql wq</font></p>
<p>) Isaiah xxviii. 10-13, which is variously understood. See (Epiphanius ed. <i>Oehler</i>, vol. i.) <i>Philastr</i>., p. 38.]</p>
<p><a name="P6622_1581247"></a>
<sup>290 </sup>So written in Latin, but in Greek <font face="SPIonic">'Abrasac</font>, the numerical value of the letters in which is three hundred and sixty-five. [See <i>Aug</i>. (ed. <i>Migne</i>), vol. viii. p. 26.] It is doubtful to whom or what this word refers; probably to the heavens.</p>
<p><a name="P6626_1582048"></a>
<sup>291 </sup>[I note again this "Americanism."]</p>
<p><a name="P6627_1582390"></a>
<sup>292 </sup>Such seems to be the meaning of the Latin, but the original text is conjectural.</p>
<p><a name="P6630_1583998"></a>
<sup>293 </sup>[See cap. xxvii. 3.] </p>
<p><a name="P6631_1584441"></a>
<sup>294 </sup>The text is here defective, but the above meaning seems to be indicated by Epiphanius.</p>
<p><a name="P6632_1584686"></a>
<sup>295 </sup>Rom. iii. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P6634_1585011"></a>
<sup>296 </sup>[Isaiah v. 20. Horne Tooke derives our word <i>Truth</i> from what any one <i>troweth</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P6635_1585793"></a>
<sup>297 </sup>The text here has greatly puzzled the editors. We follow the simple emendation proposed by Harvey.</p>
<p><a name="P6636_1586435"></a>
<sup>298 </sup>Matt. v. 25, 26; Luke xii. 58.</p>
<p><a name="P6638_1587969"></a>
<sup>299 </sup>The meaning is here very doubtful, but Tertullian understood the words as above. If sinning were a <i>necessity</i>, then it could no longer be regarded as evil.</p>
<p><a name="P6640_1589140"></a>
<sup>300 </sup>[This censure of images as a Gnostic peculiarity, and as a heathenish corruption, should be noted.]</p>
<p><a name="P6644_1589636"></a>
<sup>301 </sup>We here follow the text as preserved by Hippolytus. The Latin has, "a certain man in Asia." </p>
<p><a name="P6647_1591266"></a>
<sup>302 </sup>[This is disputed by other primitive authorities.]</p>
<p><a name="P6648_1591725"></a>
<sup>303 </sup>Rev. ii. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P6654_1594413"></a>
<sup>304 </sup>[Comp. cap. xxv. 2.]</p>
<p><a name="P6655_1594544"></a>
<sup>305 </sup>We here follow the amended version proposed by the Benedictine editor. </p>
<p><a name="P6657_1595273"></a>
<sup>306 </sup>A promise never fulfilled: comp. book iii. 12, and Euseb., <i>Hist. Eccl</i>., v. 8.</p>
<p><a name="P6658_1596216"></a>
<sup>307 </sup>[Rev. xii. 9.]</p>
<p><a name="P6662_1597961"></a>
<sup>308 </sup>[The whole casuistical system of the Trent divines, <i>De Matrimonio</i>, proceeds on this principle: marriage is licensed evil.]</p>
<p><a name="P6667_1599043"></a>
<sup>309 </sup>Harvey supposes this name to be derived from two Syriac words, meaning "God in a Tetrad." Matter again derives it from two Hebrew words, denoting "Daughter of the Lord."</p>
<p><a name="P6668_1599721"></a>
<sup>310 </sup>Both the text and meaning are here altogether doubtful. </p>
<p><a name="P6670_1601254"></a>
<sup>311 </sup>Harvey refers to the cabbalistic books in explanation of this and the following names, but their meanings are very uncertain.</p>
<p><a name="P6673_1602459"></a>
<sup>312 </sup>Harvey refers to the cabbalistic books in explanation of this and the following names, but their meanings are very uncertain.</p>
<p><a name="P6674_1604112"></a>
<sup>313 </sup>Ex. xx. 5; Isa. xlv. 5, 6.</p>
<p><a name="P6679_1605230"></a>
<sup>314 </sup>The punctuation is here difficult and doubtful. </p>
<p><a name="P6683_1608653"></a>
<sup>315 </sup>The probable meaning of this and the following names is thus given by Harvey: Ialdabaoth, <i>Lord God of the Fathers</i>; Iao, <i>Jehovah</i>; Oreus, <i>Light</i>; Astanphaeus, <i>Crown</i>; Sabaoth, of course, means <i>Hosts</i>; Adoneus, <i>Lord</i>; and Eloeus, <i>God</i>. All the names are derived from the cabbalistic theology of the Jews.</p>
<p><a name="P6684_1609972"></a>
<sup>316 </sup>Hence their name of Ophites, from <font face="SPIonic">ofej</font>, <i>a serpent.</i></p>
<p><a name="P6685_1610220"></a>
<sup>317 </sup>The Latin has <i>evertisse</i>, implying that thus Nous was more degraded.</p>
<p><a name="P6687_1611084"></a>
<sup>318 </sup>Gen. i. 26. </p>
<p><a name="P6689_1612924"></a>
<sup>319 </sup>That is, from Ialdabaoth, etc. [<i>Philastr</i>. (<i>ut supra</i>), Oehler, i. p. 38.]</p>
<p><a name="P6691_1614040"></a>
<sup>320 </sup>There is constant reference in this section to rabbinical conceits and follies.</p>
<p><a name="P6693_1615867"></a>
<sup>321 </sup>A name probably derived from the Hebrew <font face="SPTiberian">hr(n</font></p>
<p>, <i>girl</i>, but of the person referred to we know nothing.</p>
<p><a name="P6694_1616210"></a>
<sup>322 </sup>We here follow the emendation of Grabe: the defection of Prunicus is intended. </p>
<p><a name="P6696_1617381"></a>
<sup>323 </sup>The Latin here is "ex quibus," and the meaning is exceedingly obscure. Harvey thinks it is the representative <font face="SPIonic">ec wn</font> (<font face="SPIonic">xronwn</font>) in the Greek, but we prefer to refer it to "Judaeos," as above. The next sentence seems unintelligible: but, according to Harvey, "each deified day of the week had his ministering prophets."</p>
<p><a name="P6698_1618503"></a>
<sup>324 </sup>The common text inserts "et incorruptibili Aeone," but this seems better rejected as a glossarial interpolation.</p>
