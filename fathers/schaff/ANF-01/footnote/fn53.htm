<sup>10 </sup><i>Iliad</i>, xx. 66  (from Lord Derby's translation).</p>
<p><a name="P5322_1214171"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>i.e., these teachers.</p>
<p><a name="P5323_1214369"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>Literally, "those who knew."</p>
<p><a name="P5327_1216188"></a>
<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">mona/da kai\ th\n a!riston dua/da</font>. One, or unity, was considered by Pythagoras as the essence of number, and also as God. Two, or the indefinite binary, was the equivalent of evil. So Plutarch, De placit. philosoph., c 7; from which treatise the above opinions of the various sects are quoted, generally <i>verbatim</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P5328_1216662"></a>
<sup>14 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ametoxa kenou</font>: the void being that in which these bodies move, while they themselves are of a different nature from it. </p>
<p><a name="P5329_1217092"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Or, accord and discord, attraction and repulsion.</p>
<p><a name="P5333_1219207"></a>
<sup>16 </sup>Or, "is of a fiery nature."</p>
<p><a name="P5334_1219990"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>See the <i>Republic</i>, x.2. By the Platonic doctrine, the ideas of things in the mind of God were the realities; the things themselves, as seen by us, were the images of these realities; and poetry, therefore, describing the images of realities, was only at the third remove from nature. As Plato puts it briefly in this same passage, "the painter, the bed-maker, God-these three are the masters of three species of beds."</p>
<p><a name="P5335_1220485"></a>
<sup>18 </sup><i>Iliad</i>, xv. 192.</p>
<p><a name="P5336_1220878"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>i.e., from Homer; using Homer's words as suggestive and confirmatory of his doctrine.</p>
<p><a name="P5338_1221696"></a>
<sup>20 </sup><i>Iliad</i>, xiv. 246. </p>
<p><a name="P5343_1223375"></a>
<sup>21 </sup><font face="SPIonic">to logikon, to qumikon, to epiqumhtikon</font>,-corresponding to what we roughly speak of as reason, the heart, and the appetites.</p>
<p><a name="P5344_1223720"></a>
<sup>22 </sup><font face="SPIonic">entelexeia</font>,-the completion or actuality to which each thing, by virtue of its peculiar nature (or potentiality, <font face="SPIonic">dunamij</font>), can arrive.</p>
<p><a name="P5348_1224523"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>Literally, "unbegotten."</p>
<p><a name="P5349_1224875"></a>
<sup>24 </sup>Or, "liable to destruction."</p>
<p><a name="P5353_1227042"></a>
<sup>25 </sup>Literally, "the art of words."</p>
<p><a name="P5354_1227174"></a>
<sup>26 </sup>Literally, "clean," free from other influences.</p>
<p><a name="P5355_1227887"></a>
<sup>27 </sup>[The diversities of Christian theology are to be regretted; but Justin here shows the harmony and order of truths, such as are everywhere received by Christians, to be an inestimable advantage.] </p>
<p><a name="P5359_1228783"></a>
<sup>28 </sup>The incongruity in this sentence is Justin's.</p>
<p><a name="P5360_1228931"></a>
<sup>29 </sup>[Authochthones]. That is, sprung from the soil; and hence the oldest inhabitants, the aborigines.</p>
<p><a name="P5361_1229989"></a>
<sup>30 </sup>Literally, archaeology.</p>
<p><a name="P5362_1230709"></a>
<sup>31 </sup>Unfortunately, Justin here mistook Menes for Moses. [But he may have so read the name in his copy. See Grabe's note on Diodorus, and the quotation following in another note.]</p>
<p><a name="P5363_1231251"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>This sentence must be so completed from the context in Diodorus. See the note of Maranus.</p>
<p><a name="P5366_1232404"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>[Consult the ponderous learning of Warburton's <i>Divine Legation, passim</i>.] </p>
<p><a name="P5375_1236801"></a>
<sup>34 </sup>Literally, "without," not belonging to the true faith.</p>
<p><a name="P5376_1237539"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>C. 3. </p>
<p><a name="P5380_1240511"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>[Doubtless Justin relates the tradition as he received it. Consult Dr. Selwyn's full account of the fables concerning the LXX., in <i>Smith's Dict. of the Bible</i>, iii. p. 1203 ff.] </p>
