<sup>151 </sup>We here follow the Greek as preserved by Hippolytus (<i>Philosoph</i>., vi. 38). The text followed by Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>., xxxiii. 1) does not so well agree with the Latin.</p>
<p><a name="P6402_1486388"></a>
<sup>152 </sup>The text is here hopelessly corrupt; but the general meaning seems to be that given above.</p>
<p><a name="P6404_1486858"></a>
<sup>153 </sup>This sentence exists only in the Latin version, and we can give only a free translation.</p>
<p><a name="P6405_1486998"></a>
<sup>154 </sup><i>Iliad</i>, ii. 1, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P6406_1487502"></a>
<sup>155 </sup>These words are found in <i>Epiphanius</i>, but omitted in the old Latin version. The Latin gives "sense" instead of "light."</p>
<p><a name="P6408_1487902"></a>
<sup>156 </sup>The text is here very uncertain. Some propose to read <i>six</i> Aeons instead of <i>all</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P6409_1488234"></a>
<sup>157 </sup>Here again the text is corrupt and obscure. We have followed what seems the most probable emendation. </p>
<p><a name="P6411_1489384"></a>
<sup>158 </sup>Harvey justly remarks, that "one cause of perplexity in unravelling the Valentinian scheme is the recurrence of similar names at different points of the system, e.g., the Enthymesis of Sophia was called Sophia and Spiritus; and Pater, Arche, Monogenes, Christus, Anthropos, Ecclesia, were all of them terms of a double denomination."</p>
<p><a name="P6415_1490597"></a>
<sup>159 </sup>The Greek text of this section is preserved both by Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>. xxxiv. 1) and by Hippolytus (<i>Philosoph</i>., vi. 39, 40). Their citation are somewhat discordant, and we therefore follow the old Latin version.</p>
<p><a name="P6416_1491357"></a>
<sup>160 </sup>Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat</i>., xxxv. 15, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P6418_1491558"></a>
<sup>161 </sup>Epiphanius now gives the Greek text <i>verbatim</i>, to which, therefore, we return.</p>
<p><a name="P6419_1491806"></a>
<sup>162 </sup>Probably referring to Sige, the consort of Bythus.</p>
<p><a name="P6421_1493263"></a>
<sup>163 </sup>[Comp. Acts xvi. 16.]</p>
<p><a name="P6422_1493770"></a>
<sup>164 </sup>Literally, "the place of thy mightiness is in us." </p>
<p><a name="P6425_1497607"></a>
<sup>165 </sup>[Note this manner of primitive "confession;" and see Bingham, <i>Antiquities</i>, book xv. cap. 8]</p>
<p><a name="P6427_1497842"></a>
<sup>166 </sup>We here follow the rendering of Billius, "in iisdem studiis versantes." Others adhere to the received text, and translate <font face="SPIonic">peripolizontej</font> "going about idly."</p>
<p><a name="P6428_1498677"></a>
<sup>167 </sup>Grabe is of opinion that reference is made in this term to an imprecatory formula in use among the Marcosians, analogous to the form of thanksgiving employed night and morning by the Jews for their redemption from Egypt. Harvey refers the word to the <i>second</i> baptism practised among these and other heretics, by which it was supposed they were removed from the cognizance of the Demiurge, who is styled the "judge" in the close of the above sentence.</p>
<p><a name="P6429_1499408"></a>
<sup>168 </sup>That is, Sophia, of whom Achamoth, afterwards referred to, was the emanation.</p>
<p><a name="P6430_1499680"></a>
<sup>169 </sup>The angels accompanying Soter were the consorts of spiritual Gnostics, to whom they were restored after death.</p>
<p><a name="P6431_1500234"></a>
<sup>170 </sup>The syntax in this long sentence is very confused, but the meaning is tolerably plain. The gist of it is, that these Gnostics, as being the spiritual seed, claimed a consubstantiality with Achamoth, and consequently escaped from the material Deniurge, and attained at last to the Pleroma.</p>
<p><a name="P6432_1500597"></a>
<sup>171 </sup>Rendering the wearer invisible. See <i>Il</i>., v. 844. </p>
<p><a name="P6434_1501006"></a>
<sup>172 </sup>2 Tim. iii. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P6438_1501563"></a>
<sup>173 </sup>This sentence has completely baffled all the critics. [Its banter, or mock gravity, has not been self-evident.] We cannot enter upon the wide field of discussion which it has opened up, but would simply state that Irenaeus here seems to us, as often, to be playing upon the terms which were in common use among these heretics. Marcus probably received his system from Colorbasus, and is here declared, by the use of that jargon which Irenaeus means to ridicule while so employing it, to have proceeded to develop it in the way described.</p>
<p><a name="P6439_1502807"></a>
<sup>174 </sup>Such appears to be the meaning of <font face="SPIonic">anousioj</font> in this passage. The meaning of <font face="SPIonic">ousia</font> fluctuated for a time in the early Church, and was sometimes used to denote <i>material substance</i>, instead of its usual significance of <i>being</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P6440_1503480"></a>
<sup>175 </sup>The old Latin preserves <font face="SPIonic">arxh</font> untranslated, implying that this was the first word which the Father spoke. Some modern editors adopt this view, while others hold the meaning simply to be, as given above, that that first sound which the Father uttered was the origin of all the rest.</p>
<p><a name="P6441_1504380"></a>
<sup>176 </sup>The letters are here confounded with the Aeons, which they represented.</p>
<p><a name="P6442_1505071"></a>
<sup>177 </sup>[1 Cor. xiv. 16.]</p>
<p><a name="P6443_1505327"></a>
<sup>178 </sup>Matt. xviii. 10.</p>
<p><a name="P6445_1505716"></a>
<sup>179 </sup>By this Achamoth is denoted, who was said to give rise to the material elements, after the image of the Divine. </p>
<p><a name="P6446_1506899"></a>
<sup>180 </sup>That is, their names are spelt by other letters.</p>
<p><a name="P6449_1509556"></a>
<sup>181 </sup>The old Latin version renders <font face="SPIonic">epishmon</font>, <i>insigne, illustrious</i>, but there seems to be a reference to the Valentinian notion of the mystic number of 888 formed ( 10+8+200+70+400+200) vy the numerical value of the letters in the word <font face="SPIonic">Ihsouj</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P6451_1510341"></a>
<sup>182 </sup>The mutes are<font face="SPIonic"> p, k, t, b, g, d, f, x, q.</font></p>
<p><a name="P6452_1510551"></a>
<sup>183 </sup>The semi-vowels are <font face="SPIonic">l, m, n, r, j, z, c, y.</font></p>
<p><a name="P6453_1510713"></a>
<sup>184 </sup>It seems scarcely possible to give a more definite rendering of this clause: it may be literally translated thus: "And because they receive the outflow of those above, but the turning back again of those below."</p>
<p><a name="P6454_1511656"></a>
<sup>185 </sup>The ninth letter being taken from the mutes and added to the semi-vowels, an equal division of the twenty-four was thus secured.</p>
<p><a name="P6455_1512034"></a>
<sup>186 </sup>Viz., Pater, Athropos, and Logos.</p>
<p><a name="P6456_1512453"></a>
<sup>187 </sup>Viz., <font face="SPIonic">z, c, y</font> = <font face="SPIonic">dj, kj, pj.</font> </p>
<p><a name="P6458_1512795"></a>
<sup>188 </sup>Matt. xvii. 7; Mark ix. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P6459_1512912"></a>
<sup>189 </sup>Moses and Elias being added to the company.</p>
<p><a name="P6460_1513067"></a>
<sup>190 </sup>Referring to the word <font face="SPIonic">Xreistoj</font>, according to Harvey, who remarks, that "generally the Ogdoad was the receptacle of the spiritual seed."</p>
<p><a name="P6461_1513430"></a>
<sup>191 </sup>The Saviour, as Alpha and Omega, was symbolized by the dove, the sum of the Greek numerals, <font face="SPIonic">p, e, r, i, j, t, e, r, a</font> (<font face="SPIonic">peristera</font>, <i>dove</i>), being, like that of <font face="SPIonic">A</font> and <font face="SPIonic">W</font>, 801. .</p>
<p><a name="P6462_1514266"></a>
<sup>192 </sup>That is, the letters <font face="SPIonic">z, c, y</font> all contain <font face="SPIonic">j</font>, whose value is <i>six</i>, and which was called <font face="SPIonic">epishmon</font> by the Greeks.</p>
<p><a name="P6464_1514602"></a>
<sup>193 </sup>Referring to <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Aletheia</font></i>, which, in Greek, contains seven letters.</p>
<p><a name="P6465_1515069"></a>
<sup>194 </sup>By these seven powers are meant the seven heavens (also called angels), formed by the Demiurge.</p>
<p><a name="P6467_1516567"></a>
<sup>195 </sup>We here follow the text of Hippolytus: the ordinary text and the old Latin read, "So does the soul of infants, weeping and mourning over Marcus, deify him."</p>
<p><a name="P6468_1516836"></a>
<sup>196 </sup>Ps. viii. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P6469_1516907"></a>
<sup>197 </sup>Ps. xix. 1.</p>
<p><a name="P6470_1517098"></a>
<sup>198 </sup>The text is here altogether uncertain: we have given the probable meaning.</p>
<p><a name="P6472_1517317"></a>
<sup>199 </sup>That is, the name of Soter, the perfect result of the whole Pleroma. </p>
<p><a name="P6476_1519193"></a>
<sup>200 </sup>Manifestly to be so spelt here, as in the sequel <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Chreistus</font></i>, for <font face="Semitica Dict">Christus</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P6477_1519716"></a>
<sup>201 </sup>The text is here altogether uncertain, and the meaning obscure.</p>
<p><a name="P6479_1520666"></a>
<sup>202 </sup>The reading is exceedingly doubtful: some prefer the number <i>eighty-eight.</i></p>
<p><a name="P6480_1521087"></a>
<sup>203 </sup>There were, as Harvey observes, three extraneous characters introduced into the Greek alphabet for the sake of numeration-the three <i>episema</i> for 6, 90, and 900 respectively. The true alphabet, then, as employed to denote number, included eight units, eight tens, and eight hundreds.</p>
<p><a name="P6481_1522687"></a>
<sup>204 </sup>Or, according to the Greek text, "being as the way to the Father;" comp. John xiv. 6. </p>
<p><a name="P6483_1524548"></a>
<sup>205 </sup>The text is here uncertain: we follow that suggested by Grabe.</p>
<p><a name="P6485_1525111"></a>
<sup>206 </sup>[Comp. cap. xi. 4, <i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p><a name="P6486_1525577"></a>
<sup>207 </sup>Comp. Gen. xxxi. 2.-We here follow the punctuation of Scaliger, now generally accepted by the editors, though entirely different from the old Latin.</p>
<p><a name="P6488_1528355"></a>
<sup>208 </sup>[Mosheim thinks this Marcus was a lunatic.]</p>
<p><a name="P6490_1528514"></a>
<sup>209 </sup>[Some think Pothinus.] </p>
<p><a name="P6494_1529588"></a>
<sup>210 </sup>Luke xv. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P6495_1530270"></a>
<sup>211 </sup>All the editors, Grabe, Massuet, Stieren, and Harvey, differ as to the text and interpretation of this sentence. We have given what seems the simplest rendering of the text as it stands.</p>
<p><a name="P6496_1530616"></a>
<sup>212 </sup>Referring to the last of the twelve Aeons.</p>
<p><a name="P6497_1530939"></a>
