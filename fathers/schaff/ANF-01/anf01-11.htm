Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the faith given to them, and in love and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all truth, and loving all [others] equally in all chastity; and to train up their children in the knowledge and fear of God.

But who of us are ignorant of the judgment of the Lord? "Do we not know that the saints shall judge the world? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P869_158616" id="P869_158616" name="P869_158616">64</a></sup> as Paul teaches. But I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the blessed Paul laboured, and who are commended<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P870_158785" id="P870_158785" name="P870_158785">65</a></sup> in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which alone then knew the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet known Him. I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be ye then moderate in regard to this matter, and "do not count such as enemies,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P871_159181" id="P871_159181" name="P871_159181">66</a></sup> but call them back as suffering and straying members, that ye may save your whole body. For by so acting ye shall edify yourselves.<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P872_159336" id="P872_159336" name="P872_159336">67</a></sup> </p>

But may the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ Himself, who is the Son of God, and our everlasting High Priest, build you up in faith and truth, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and portion among His saints, and on us with you, and on all that are under heaven, who shall believe in our Lord Jesus Christ, and in His Father, who "raised Him from the dead.<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P880_160419" id="P880_160419" name="P880_160419">72</a></sup> Pray for all the saints.

The Epistles of Ignatius written by him<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P888_161144" id="P888_161144" name="P888_161144">77</a></sup> to us, and all the rest [of his Epistles] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them ye may be greatly profited; for they treat of faith and patience, and all things that tend to edification in our Lord. Any<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P889_161541" id="P889_161541" name="P889_161541">78</a></sup> more certain information you may have obtained respecting both Ignatius himself, and those that were<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P890_161703" id="P890_161703" name="P890_161703">79</a></sup> with him, have the goodness to make known<sup><a href="footnote/fn8.htm#P891_161816" id="P891_161816" name="P891_161816">80</a></sup> to us.</p>
