<font size="3">Chapter I.-The Salutation. Praise of the Corinthians Before the Breaking Forth of Schism Among Them.</font></p>
</ul><p>The Church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the Church of God sojourning at Corinth, to them that are called and sanctified by the will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.</p>
<p>Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which you consulted us;<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P178_21556" id="P178_21556" name="P178_21556">2</a></sup> and especially to that shameful and detestable sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved, has suffered grievous injury.<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P179_22010" id="P179_22010" name="P179_22010">3</a></sup> For who ever dwelt even for a short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of virtue as it was firmly established?<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P180_22187" id="P180_22187" name="P180_22187">4</a></sup> Who did not admire the sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ? Who did not proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality? And who did not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge? For ye did all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving all fitting honour to the presbyters among you. Ye enjoined young men to be of a sober and serious mind; ye instructed your wives to do all things with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their husbands as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule of obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly, and be in every respect marked by discretion.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P182_23011"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter II.-Praise of the Corinthians Continued.</font></p>
</ul><p>Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it,<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P184_23200" id="P184_23200" name="P184_23200">5</a></sup> and were more willing to give than to receive.<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P185_23275" id="P185_23275" name="P185_23275">6</a></sup> Content with the provision which God had made for you, and carefully attending to His words, ye were inwardly filled<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P186_23408" id="P186_23408" name="P186_23408">7</a></sup> with His doctrine, and His sufferings were before your eyes. Thus a profound and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was upon you all. Full of holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty, beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty of any involuntary transgression. Day and night ye were anxious for the whole brotherhood,<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P187_24092" id="P187_24092" name="P187_24092">8</a></sup> that the number of God's elect might be saved with mercy and a good conscience.<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P188_24190" id="P188_24190" name="P188_24190">9</a></sup> Ye were sincere and uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one <i>another</i>. Every kind of faction and schism was abominable in your sight. Ye mourned over the transgressions of your neighbours: their deficiencies you deemed your own. Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being "ready to every good work."<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P189_24688" id="P189_24688" name="P189_24688">10</a></sup> Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious life, ye did all things in the fear of God. The commandments and ordinances of the Lord were written upon the tablets of your hearts.<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P190_24887" id="P190_24887" name="P190_24887">11</a></sup> </p>

</ul><p>Every kind of honour and happiness<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P194_25044" id="P194_25044" name="P194_25044">12</a></sup> was bestowed upon you, and then was fulfilled that which is written, "My beloved did eat and drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked."<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P195_25220" id="P195_25220" name="P195_25220">13</a></sup> Hence flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and disorder, war and captivity. So the worthless rose up against the honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years. For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you, inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in His faith,<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P196_25669" id="P196_25669" name="P196_25669">14</a></sup> neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment, nor acts a part becoming a Christian,<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P197_25870" id="P197_25870" name="P197_25870">15</a></sup> but walks after his own wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy, by which death itself entered into the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn1.htm#P198_26071" id="P198_26071" name="P198_26071">16</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">Chapter IV.-Many Evils Have Already Flowed from This Source in Ancient Times.</font></p>
</ul><p>For thus it is written: "And it came to pass after certain days, that Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel also brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of the fat thereof. And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his sacrifices He did not regard. And Cain was deeply grieved, and his countenance fell. And God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why is try countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly, but dost not divide rightly, hast thou not sinned? Be at peace: thine offering returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it. And Cain said to Abel his brother, Let us go into the field. And it came to pass, while they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P202_26937" id="P202_26937" name="P202_26937">17</a></sup> Ye see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the murder of a brother. Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from the face of Esau his brother.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P203_27494" id="P203_27494" name="P203_27494">18</a></sup> Envy made Joseph be persecuted unto death, and to come into bondage.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P204_27589" id="P204_27589" name="P204_27589">19</a></sup> Envy compelled Moses to flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words from his fellow-countryman, "Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us? wilt thou kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P205_27837" id="P205_27837" name="P205_27837">20</a></sup> On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without the camp.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P206_27933" id="P206_27933" name="P206_27933">21</a></sup> Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades, through the sedition which they excited against God's servant Moses.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P207_28142" id="P207_28142" name="P207_28142">22</a></sup> Through envy, David underwent the hatred not only of foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of Israel.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P208_28274" id="P208_28274" name="P208_28274">23</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">Chapter V.-No Less Evils Have Arisen from the Same Source in the Most Recent Times. The Martyrdom of Peter and Paul.</font></p>
</ul><p>But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent spiritual heroes.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P212_28507" id="P212_28507" name="P212_28507">24</a></sup> Let us take the noble examples furnished in our own generation. Through envy and jealousy, the greatest and most righteous pillars [of the Church] have been persecuted and put to death.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P213_28741" id="P213_28741" name="P213_28741">25</a></sup> Let us set before our eyes the illustrious<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P214_28885" id="P214_28885" name="P214_28885">26</a></sup> apostles. Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but numerous labours and when he had at length suffered martyrdom, departed to the place of glory due to him. Owing to envy, Paul also obtained the reward of patient endurance, after being seven times thrown into captivity,<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P215_29343" id="P215_29343" name="P215_29343">27</a></sup> compelled<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P216_29425" id="P216_29425" name="P216_29425">28</a></sup> to flee, and stoned. After preaching both in the east and west, he gained the illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness to the whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west,<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P217_29773" id="P217_29773" name="P217_29773">29</a></sup> and suffered martyrdom under the prefects.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P218_29920" id="P218_29920" name="P218_29920">30</a></sup> Thus was he removed from the world, and went into the holy place, having proved himself a striking example of patience.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter VI.-Continuation. Several Other Martyrs.</font></p>
</ul><p>To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there is to be added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy endured many indignities and tortures, furnished. us with a most excellent example. Through envy, those women, the Danaids<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P222_30669" id="P222_30669" name="P222_30669">31</a></sup> and Dircae, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith with stedfastness,<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P223_31058" id="P223_31058" name="P223_31058">32</a></sup> and though weak in body, received a noble reward. Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying of our father Adam, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh."<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P224_31317" id="P224_31317" name="P224_31317">33</a></sup> Envy and strife have overthrown great cities and rooted up mighty nations. </p>
<ul><p><a name="P226_31410"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter VII.-An Exhortation to Repentance.</font></p>
</ul><p>These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of your duty, but also to remind ourselves. For we are struggling on the same arena, and the same conflict is assigned to both of us. Wherefore let us give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious and venerable rule of our holy calling. Let us attend to what is good, pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us. Let us look stedfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious that blood is to God,<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P228_31957" id="P228_31957" name="P228_31957">34</a></sup> which, having been shed for our salvation, has set the grace of repentance before the whole world. Let us turn to every age that has passed, and learn that, from generation to generation, the Lord has granted a place of repentance to all such as would be converted unto Him. Noah preached repentance, and as many as listened to him were saved.<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P229_32328" id="P229_32328" name="P229_32328">35</a></sup> Jonah proclaimed destruction to the Ninevites;<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P230_32421" id="P230_32421" name="P230_32421">36</a></sup> but they, repenting of their sins, propitiated God by prayer, and obtained salvation, although they were aliens [to the covenant] of God.</p>

And in another place He speaks thus: "Wash you, and become clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before mine eyes; cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment, deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together. He declares, Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow; though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool. And if ye be willing and obey Me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuse, and will not hearken unto Me, the sword shall devour you, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things."<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P238_34066" id="P238_34066" name="P238_34066">41</a></sup> Desiring, therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations].</p>

He, in the exercise of obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and from his father's house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory, and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the promises of God. For God said to him, "Get thee out from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into the land which I shall show thee.

But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed them on the roof of her house under some stalks of flax. And when the men sent by the king arrived and said "There came men unto thee who are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands," she answered them, "The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly departed again and are gone," thus not discovering the spies to them. Then she said to the men, "I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath given you this city, for the fear and dread of you have fallen on its inhabitants. When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep ye me and the house of my father in safety." And they said to her, "It shall be as thou hast spoken to us.

For thus He spoke: "Be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you ; as ye do, so shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete, with the same it shall be measured to you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn2.htm#P267_40577" id="P267_40577" name="P267_40577">55</a></sup> By this precept and by these rules let us establish ourselves, that we walk with all humility in obedience to His holy words.

</ul><p>For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who exalt themselves over His flock. Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance, although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy Spirit had declared regarding Him. For He says, "Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? We have declared [our message] in His presence: He is, as it were, a child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory, yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form of men. He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, anti acquainted with the endurance of grief: for His countenance was turned away; He was despised, and not esteemed. He bears our iniquities, and is in sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction. But He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way; and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst of His sufferings openeth not His mouth. He was brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth not His mouth. In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death.

But as the flesh decays a certain kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the dead bird, brings forth feathers. Then, when it has acquired strength, it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing these it passes from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city called Heliopolis. And, in open day, flying in the sight of all men, it places them on the altar of the sun, and having done this, hastens back to its former abode.

Love admits of no schisms: love gives rise to no seditions: love does all things in harmony. By love have all the elect of God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing to God. In love has the Lord taken us to Himself. On account of the Love he bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by the will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P542_93345" id="P542_93345" name="P542_93345">222</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">Chapter L.-Let Us Pray to Be Thought Worthy of Love.</font></p>
</ul><p>Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that there is no declaring its perfection. Who is fit to be found in it, except such as God has vouchsafed to render so? Let us pray, therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live blameless in love, free from all human partialities for one above another. All the generations from Adam even unto this day have passed away; but those who, through the grace of God, have been made perfect in love, now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the revelation<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P546_94017" id="P546_94017" name="P546_94017">223</a></sup> of the kingdom of Christ. For it is written, "Enter into thy secret chambers for a little time, until my wrath and fury pass away; and I will remember a propitious<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P547_94213" id="P547_94213" name="P547_94213">224</a></sup> day, and will raise you up out of your graves."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P548_94280" id="P548_94280" name="P548_94280">225</a></sup> Blessed are we, beloved, if we keep the commandments of God in the harmony of love; that so through love our sins may be forgiven us. For it is written, "Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose mouth there is no guile."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P549_94637" id="P549_94637" name="P549_94637">226</a></sup> This blessedness cometh upon those who have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P551_94794"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter LI.-Let the Partakers in Strife Acknowledge Their Sins.</font></p>
</ul><p>Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which through any [suggestion] of the adversary we have committed. And those who have been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have respect<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P553_95079" id="P553_95079" name="P553_95079">227</a></sup> to the common hope. For such as live in fear and love would rather that they themselves than their neighbours should be involved in suffering. And they prefer to bear blame themselves, rather than that the concord which has been well and piously<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P554_95347" id="P554_95347" name="P554_95347">228</a></sup> handed down to us should suffer. For it is better that a man should acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as the hearts of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses the servant of God, and whose condemnation was made manifest [unto all]. For they went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed them up.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P555_95724" id="P555_95724" name="P555_95724">229</a></sup> Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt, and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red Sea, and perished,<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P556_95883" id="P556_95883" name="P556_95883">230</a></sup> for no other reason than that their foolish hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter LII.-Such a Confession is Pleasing to God.</font></p>
</ul><p>The Lord, brethren, stands in need of nothing; and He desires nothing of any one, except that confession be made to Him. For, says the elect David, "I will confess unto the Lord ; and that will please Him more than a young bullock that hath horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it, and be glad."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P560_96406" id="P560_96406" name="P560_96406">231</a></sup> And again he saith, "Offer<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P561_96457" id="P561_96457" name="P561_96457">232</a></sup> unto God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.

<font size="3">Chapter LIII.-The Love of Moses Towards His People.</font></p>
</ul><p>Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well the Sacred Scriptures, and ye have looked very earnestly into the oracles of God. Call then these things to your remembrance. When Moses went up into the mount, and abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days and forty nights, the Lord said unto him, "Moses, Moses, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt have committed iniquity. They have speedily departed from the way in which I commanded them to walk, and have made to themselves molten images."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P567_97343" id="P567_97343" name="P567_97343">235</a></sup> And the Lord said unto him, "I have spoken to thee once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people: let Me destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make thee a great and wonderful nation, and one much more numerous than this."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P568_97684" id="P568_97684" name="P568_97684">236</a></sup> But Moses said, "Far be it from Thee, Lord: pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out of the book of the living."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P569_97835" id="P569_97835" name="P569_97835">237</a></sup> O marvellous<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P570_97870" id="P570_97870" name="P570_97870">238</a></sup> love! O insuperable perfection! The servant speaks freely to his Lord, and asks forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might perish<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P571_98036" id="P571_98036" name="P571_98036">239</a></sup> along with them.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter LIV.-He Who is Full of Love Will Incur Every Loss, that Peace May Be Restored to the Church.</font></p>
</ul><p>Who then among you is noble-minded? who compassionate? who full of love? Let him declare, "If on my account sedition and disagreement and schisms have arisen, I will depart, I will go away whithersoever ye desire, and I will do whatever the majority<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P575_98436" id="P575_98436" name="P575_98436">240</a></sup> commands; only let the flock of Christ live on terms of peace with the presbyters set over it." He that acts thus shall procure to himself great glory in the Lord; and every place will welcome<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P576_98867" id="P576_98867" name="P576_98867">241</a></sup> him.

<font size="3">Chapter LV.-Examples of Such Love.</font></p>
</ul><p>To bring forward some examples from among the heathen: Many kings and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens [from destruction]. Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so sedition might be brought to an end within them. We know many among ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they might ransom others. Many, too, have surrendered themselves to slavery, that with the price<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P581_99686" id="P581_99686" name="P581_99686">243</a></sup> which they received for themselves, they might provide food for others. Many women also, being strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly exploits. The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and, exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes into the hands of a woman.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P582_100261" id="P582_100261" name="P582_100261">244</a></sup> Esther also, being perfect in faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction. For with fasting and humiliation she entreated the everlasting God, who seeth all things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the people for whose sake she had encountered peril.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P583_100633" id="P583_100633" name="P583_100633">245</a></sup> .</p>
<ul><p><a name="P585_100658"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter LVI.-Let Us Admonish and Correct One Another.</font></p>
</ul><p>Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that meekness and humility may be given to them, so that they may submit, not unto us, but to the will of God. For in this way they shall secure a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for them, both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the saints.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P587_101055" id="P587_101055" name="P587_101055">246</a></sup> Let us receive correction, beloved, on account of which no one should feel displeased. Those exhortations by which we admonish one another are both good [in themselves] and highly profitable, for they tend to unite<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P588_101399" id="P588_101399" name="P588_101399">247</a></sup> us to the will of God. For thus saith the holy Word: "The Lord hath severely chastened me, yet hath not given me over to death."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P589_101553" id="P589_101553" name="P589_101553">248</a></sup> "For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P590_101661" id="P590_101661" name="P590_101661">249</a></sup> "The righteous," saith it, "shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let not the oil of sinners make fat my head."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P591_101817" id="P591_101817" name="P591_101817">250</a></sup> And again he saith, "Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not thou the warning of the Almighty. For He causes sorrow, and again restores [to gladness]; He woundeth, and His hands make whole. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall touch thee. In famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He shall free thee from the power<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P592_102219" id="P592_102219" name="P592_102219">251</a></sup> of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue will He hide thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh. Thou shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the wicked, and shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the field. For the wild beasts shall be at peace with thee: then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the habitation of thy tabernacle shall not fail.<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P593_102612" id="P593_102612" name="P593_102612">252</a></sup> Thou shall know also that thy seed shall be great, and thy children like the grass of the field. And thou shall come to the grave like ripened corn which is reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is gathered together at the proper time."<sup><a href="footnote/fn5.htm#P594_102911" id="P594_102911" name="P594_102911">253</a></sup> Ye see, beloved, that protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord; for since God is good, He corrects us, that we may be admonished by His holy chastisement.</p>
