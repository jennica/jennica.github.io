<p>We do not deny that all these things which have been brought forward by you in opposition are contained in the writings of the annalists. For we have ourselves also, according to the measure and capacity of our powers, read these same things, and know that they have been alleged; but the whole discussion hinges upon this: whether these are gods who you assert are furious when displeased, and are soothed by games and sacrifices, or are something far different, and should be separated from the notion even of this, and from its power.</p>
<p>For who, in the first place, thinks or believes that those are gods who are lost in joyful pleasure at theatrical shows<sup><a href="footnote/fn86.htm#P8620_2739171" id="P8620_2739171" name="P8620_2739171">2</a></sup> and ballets, at horses running to no purpose; who set out from heaven to behold silly and insipid acting, and grieve that they are injured, and that the honours due to them are withheld if the pantomimist halts for a little, or the player, being wearied, rests a little; who declare that the dancer has displeased them if some guilty <i>fellow</i> passes through the middle of the circus to suffer the penalty and punishment of his deeds? All which things, if they be sifted thoroughly and without any partiality, will be found to be alien not only to the gods, but to any man of refinement, even if he has not been trained to the utmost gravity and self-control.<sup><a href="footnote/fn86.htm#P8621_2739848" id="P8621_2739848" name="P8621_2739848">3</a></sup> </p>
