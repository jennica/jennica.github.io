<p>1. Here, if any means could be found, I should wish to converse thus with all those who hate the name of Christ, turning aside for a little from the defence primarily set up:-If you think it no dishonour to answer when asked a question, explain to us and say what is the cause, what the reason, that you pursue Christ with so bitter hostility? or what offences you remember which He did, that at the mention of His name you are roused to bursts of mad and savage fury?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6649_2081845" id="P6649_2081845" name="P6649_2081845">2</a></sup> Did He ever, in claiming for Himself power as king, fill the whole world with bands of the fiercest soldiers; and of nations at peace from the beginning, did He destroy and put an end to some, <i>and</i> compel others to submit to His yoke and serve Him? Did He ever, excited by grasping<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6650_2082182" id="P6650_2082182" name="P6650_2082182">3</a></sup> avarice, claim as His own by right all that wealth to have abundance of which men strive eagerly? Did He ever, transported with lustful passions, break down by force the barriers of purity, or stealthily lie in wait for other men's wives? Did He ever, puffed up with haughty arrogance, inflict at random injuries and insults, without any distinction of persons? (B) And He was not worthy that you should listen to and believe <i>Him, yet</i> He should not have been despised by you even on this account, that He showed to you things concerning your salvation, that He prepared for you a path<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6651_2082795" id="P6651_2082795" name="P6651_2082795">4</a></sup> to heaven, and the immortality for which you long; although<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6652_2083230" id="P6652_2083230" name="P6652_2083230">5</a></sup> He neither extended the light of life to all, nor delivered all from the danger which threatens them through their ignorance.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6653_2083703" id="P6653_2083703" name="P6653_2083703">6</a></sup> </p>
<p>2. But indeed, <i>some one will say</i>, He deserved our hatred because He has driven religion<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6655_2083912" id="P6655_2083912" name="P6655_2083912">7</a></sup> from the world, because He has kept men back from seeking to honour the gods.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6656_2083997" id="P6656_2083997" name="P6656_2083997">8</a></sup> Is He then denounced as the destroyer of religion and promoter of impiety, who brought true religion into the world, who opened the gates of piety to men blind and verily living in impiety, and pointed out to whom they should bow themselves? Or is there any truer religion-<i>one</i> more serviceable,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6657_2085071" id="P6657_2085071" name="P6657_2085071">9</a></sup> powerful, and <i>right</i>-than to have learned to know the supreme God, to know <i>how</i> to pray to God Supreme, who alone is the source and fountain of all good, the creator,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6658_2085383" id="P6658_2085383" name="P6658_2085383">10</a></sup> founder, and framer of all that endures, by whom all things on earth and all in heaven are quickened, and filled with the stir of life, and without whom there would assuredly be nothing to bear any name, and <i>have any</i> substance? But perhaps you doubt whether there is that ruler of whom we speak, and rather <i>incline to</i> believe in the existence of Apollo, Diana, Mercury, Mars, Give a true judgment;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6659_2086316" id="P6659_2086316" name="P6659_2086316">11</a></sup> and, looking round on all these things which we see, <i>any one</i> will rather doubt whether all the other gods exist, than hesitate with regard to the God whom we <i>all</i> know by nature, whether when we cry out, O God, or when we make God the witness of wicked <i>deeds</i>,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6660_2087012" id="P6660_2087012" name="P6660_2087012">12</a></sup> and raise our face to heaven as though He saw us.</p>
<p>3. But He did not permit men to make supplication to the lesser gods. Do you, then, know who are, or where are the lesser gods? Has mistrust of them, or the way in which they were mentioned, ever touched you, so that you are justly indignant that their worship has been done away with and deprived of all honour?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6662_2087618" id="P6662_2087618" name="P6662_2087618">13</a></sup> But if haughtiness of mind and arrogance,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6663_2087816" id="P6663_2087816" name="P6663_2087816">14</a></sup> as it is called by the Greeks, did not stand in your way and hinder you, you might long ago have been able to understand what He forbade to be done, or wherefore; within what limits He would have true religion lie;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6664_2088051" id="P6664_2088051" name="P6664_2088051">15</a></sup> what danger arose to you from that which you thought obedience? or from what evils you would escape if you broke away from your dangerous delusion.</p>
<p>4. But all these things will be more clearly and distinctly noticed when we have proceeded further. For we shall show that Christ did not teach the nations impiety, but delivered ignorant and wretched then from those who most wickedly wronged them.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6666_2088479" id="P6666_2088479" name="P6666_2088479">16</a></sup> We do not believe, you say, that what He says is true. What, then? Have you no doubt as to the things which<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6667_2088754" id="P6667_2088754" name="P6667_2088754">17</a></sup> you say are not true, while, as they are <i>only</i> at hand, and not yet disclosed<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6668_2088886" id="P6668_2088886" name="P6668_2088886">18</a></sup> they can by no means be disproved? But He, too, does not prove what He promises. It is so; for, as I said, there can be no proof of <i>things still in</i> the future. Since, then, the nature of the future is such that it cannot be grasped and comprehended by any anticipation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6669_2089409" id="P6669_2089409" name="P6669_2089409">19</a></sup> is it not more rational,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6670_2089480" id="P6670_2089480" name="P6670_2089480">20</a></sup> of two things uncertain and hanging in doubtful suspense, rather to believe that which carries <i>with it</i> some hopes, than that which <i>brings</i> none at all? For in the one case there is no danger, if that which is said to be at hand should prove vain and groundless; in the other there is the greatest loss, even<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6671_2089817" id="P6671_2089817" name="P6671_2089817">21</a></sup> the loss of salvation, if, when the time has come, it be shown that there was nothing false <i>in what was declared</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6672_2089994" id="P6672_2089994" name="P6672_2089994">22</a></sup> </p>
<p>5. What say you, O ignorant ones, for whom we might well weep and be sad?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6674_2090398" id="P6674_2090398" name="P6674_2090398">23</a></sup> Are you so void of fear that these things may be true which are despised by you and turned to ridicule? and do you not consider with yourselves at least, in your secret thoughts, lest that which to-day with perverse obstinacy you refuse to believe, time may too late show to be true,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6675_2090734" id="P6675_2090734" name="P6675_2090734">24</a></sup> and ceaseless remorse punish <i>you?</i> Do not even these proofs at least give you faith to believe,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6676_2091086" id="P6676_2091086" name="P6676_2091086">25</a></sup> <i>viz</i>., that already, in so short and brief a time, the oaths of this vast army have spread abroad over all the earth? that already there is no nation so rude and fierce that it has not, changed by His love, subdued its fierceness, and with tranquillity hitherto unknown, become mild m disposition?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6677_2091595" id="P6677_2091595" name="P6677_2091595">26</a></sup> that <i>men</i> endowed with so great abilities, orators, critics, rhetoricians, lawyers, and physicians, those, too, who pry into the mysteries of philosophy, seek to learn these things, despising those in which but now they trusted? that slaves choose to be tortured by their masters as they please, wives to be divorced, children to be disinherited by their parents, rather than be unfaithful to Christ and cast off the oaths of the warfare of salvation? that although so terrible punishments have been denounced by you against those who follow the precepts of this religion, it<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6678_2092238" id="P6678_2092238" name="P6678_2092238">27</a></sup> increases <i>even</i> more, and a great host strives more boldly against all threats and the terrors which would keep it back, and is roused to zealous faith by the very attempt to hinder it? Do you indeed believe that these things happen idly and at random? that these feelings are adopted on being met with by chance?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6679_2092574" id="P6679_2092574" name="P6679_2092574">28</a></sup> Is not this, then, sacred and divine? Or <i>do you believe</i> that, without God's <i>grace</i>, their minds are so changed, that although murderous hooks and other tortures without number threaten, as we said, those who shall believe, they receive the grounds of faith with which they have become acquainted,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6680_2092905" id="P6680_2092905" name="P6680_2092905">29</a></sup> as if carried away (A) by some charm, and by an eager longing for all the virtues,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6681_2093301" id="P6681_2093301" name="P6681_2093301">30</a></sup> and prefer the friendship of Christ to all that is in the world?<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6682_2094118" id="P6682_2094118" name="P6682_2094118">31</a></sup> </p>
<p>6. But perhaps those seem to you weak-minded and silly, who even now are uniting all over the world, and joining together to assent with that readiness of belief <i>at which you mock</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6684_2094465" id="P6684_2094465" name="P6684_2094465">32</a></sup> What then?

Do you alone perceive that all these things are trifles? you alone, that those things are mere words and childish absurdities which we declare <i>are</i> about to come to us from the supreme Ruler? Whence, pray, has so much wisdom been given to you? whence so much subtlety and wit? Or from what scientific training have you been able to gain so much wisdom, to derive so much foresight? Because you are skilled in declining verbs and nouns by cases and tenses, <i>and</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6687_2095624" id="P6687_2095624" name="P6687_2095624">35</a></sup> in avoiding barbarous words and expressions; because you have learned either to express yourselves in<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6688_2095761" id="P6688_2095761" name="P6688_2095761">36</a></sup> harmonious, and orderly, and fitly-disposed language, or to know when it is rude and unpolished;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6689_2095904" id="P6689_2095904" name="P6689_2095904">37</a></sup> because you have stamped on your memory the Fornix of Lucilius,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6690_2096161" id="P6690_2096161" name="P6690_2096161">38</a></sup> and Marsyas of Pomponius; because <i>you know</i> what the issues to be proposed in lawsuits are, how many kinds of cases there are, how many ways of pleading, what the genus is, what the species, by what methods an opposite is distinguished from a contrary,-do you therefore think that you know what is false, what true, what can or cannot be done, what is the nature of the lowest and highest? Have the well-known words never rung in<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6691_2097496" id="P6691_2097496" name="P6691_2097496">39</a></sup> your ears, that the wisdom of man is foolishness with God?</p>
<p>7. In the first place, you yourselves, too,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6693_2097877" id="P6693_2097877" name="P6693_2097877">40</a></sup> see clearly that, if you ever discuss obscure subjects, and seek to lay bare the mysteries of nature, on the one hand you do not know the very things which you speak of, which you affirm, which you uphold very often with especial zeal, and that each one defends with obstinate resistance his own suppositions as though they were proved and ascertained <i>truths</i>. For how can we of ourselves know whether we<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6694_2098586" id="P6694_2098586" name="P6694_2098586">41</a></sup> perceive the truth, even if all ages be employed in seeking out knowledge-<i>we</i> whom some envious power<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6695_2098798" id="P6695_2098798" name="P6695_2098798">42</a></sup> brought forth, and formed so ignorant and proud, that, although we know nothing at all, we yet deceive ourselves, and are uplifted by pride and arrogance so as to suppose ourselves possessed of knowledge? For, to pass by divine things, and those plunged in natural obscurity, can any man explain that which in the Phaedrus<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6696_2099337" id="P6696_2099337" name="P6696_2099337">43</a></sup> the well-known Socrates cannot comprehend-what man is, or whence he is, uncertain, changeable, deceitful, manifold, of many kinds? for what purposes he was produced? by whose ingenuity he was devised? what he does in the world? (C) why he undergoes such countless ills? whether the earth gave life to him as to worms and mice, being affected with decay through the action of some moisture;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6697_2100268" id="P6697_2100268" name="P6697_2100268">44</a></sup> or whether he received<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6698_2100544" id="P6698_2100544" name="P6698_2100544">45</a></sup> these outlines of body, and <i>this</i> cast of face, from the hand of some maker and framer?

Now the weakness and wretched ignorance of these <i>theories</i> is greater on this account, that while it may happen that we at times say something which is true,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6706_2103111" id="P6706_2103111" name="P6706_2103111">53</a></sup> we cannot be sure even of this very thing, whether we have spoken the truth at all.</p>
<p>8. And since you have been wont to laugh at our faith, and with droll jests to pull to pieces our readiness of belief too, say, O wits, soaked and filled with wisdom's pure drought, is there in life any kind of business demanding diligence and activity, which the doers<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6708_2103497" id="P6708_2103497" name="P6708_2103497">54</a></sup> undertake, engage in, and essay, without believing <i>that it can be done</i>? Do you travel about, do you sail on the sea without believing that you will return home when your business is done? Do you break up the earth with the plough, and fill it with different kinds of seeds without believing that you will gather in the fruit with the changes of the seasons? Do you unite with partners in marriage,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6709_2104019" id="P6709_2104019" name="P6709_2104019">55</a></sup> without believing that it will be pure, and a union serviceable to the husband? Do you beget children without believing that they will pass<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6710_2104201" id="P6710_2104201" name="P6710_2104201">56</a></sup> safely through the <i>different</i> stages of life to the goal of age? Do you commit your sick bodies to the hands of physicians, without believing that diseases can be relieved by their severity being lessened? Do you wage wars with your enemies, without believing that you will carry off the victory by success in battles?<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6711_2104550" id="P6711_2104550" name="P6711_2104550">57</a></sup> Do you worship and serve the gods without believing that they are, and that they listen graciously to your prayers?</p>

Does not each one trust this author or that? That which any one has persuaded himself is said with truth by another, does he not defend with a kind of assent, as it were, <i>like that</i> of faith?

But if that, too, which is said in the more hidden mysteries is true, that the souls of wicked men, on leaving their human bodies, pass into cattle and other creatures,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6790_2132955" id="P6790_2132955" name="P6790_2132955">128</a></sup> it is <i>even</i> more clearly shown that we are allied to them, and not separated by any great interval, since it is on the same ground that both we and they are said to be living creatures, and to act as such. </p>
<p>17. But we have reason, <i>one will say</i>, and excel the whole race of dumb animals in understanding. I might believe that this was quite true, if all men lived rationally and wisely, never swerved aside from their duty, abstained from what is forbidden, and withheld themselves from baseness, and <i>if</i> no one through folly and the blindness of ignorance demanded what is injurious and dangerous to himself. I should wish, however, to know what this reason is, through which we are more excellent than all the tribes of animals. <i>Is it</i> because we have made for ourselves houses, by which we can avoid the cold of winter and heat of summer? What! do not the other animals show forethought in this respect? Do we not see some build nests as dwellings for themselves in the most convenient situations; others shelter and secure <i>themselves</i> in rocks and lofty crags; others burrow in the ground, and prepare for themselves strongholds and lairs in the pits which they have dug out? But if nature, which gave them life, had chosen to give to them also hands to help them, they too would, without doubt, raise lofty buildings and strike out new works of art.<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6792_2134342" id="P6792_2134342" name="P6792_2134342">129</a></sup> Yet, even in those things which they make with beaks and claws, we see that there are many appearances of reason and wisdom which we men are unable to copy, however much we ponder them, although we have hands to serve us dexterously in every kind of work.</p>
<p>18. They have not learned, <i>I will be told</i>, to make clothing, seats, ships, and ploughs, nor, in fine, the other furniture which family life requires.These are not the gifts of science, but the suggestions of most pressing necessity; nor did the arts descend with <i>men's</i> souls from the inmost heavens, but here on earth have they all been painfully sought out and brought to light,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6794_2135276" id="P6794_2135276" name="P6794_2135276">130</a></sup> and gradually acquired in process of time by careful thought. But if the soul<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6795_2135375" id="P6795_2135375" name="P6795_2135375">131</a></sup> had <i>in itself</i> the knowledge which it is fitting that a race should have indeed <i>which is</i> divine and immortal, all men would from the first know everything; nor would there be an age unacquainted with any art, or not furnished with practical knowledge. But now a life of want and in need of many things, noticing some things happen accidentally to its advantage, while it imitates, experiments, and tries, while it fails, remoulds, changes, from continual failure has procured for itself<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6796_2135948" id="P6796_2135948" name="P6796_2135948">132</a></sup> and wrought out some slight acquaintance with the arts, and brought to one issue the advances of many ages.</p>

Never, I say, carried away by pride and arrogance, would they believe themselves to be deities of the first rank, and fellows of the highest in his exaltation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6800_2137214" id="P6800_2137214" name="P6800_2137214">135</a></sup> because they<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6801_2137291" id="P6801_2137291" name="P6801_2137291">136</a></sup> had devised the arts of grammar, music, oratory, and geometry. For we do not see what is <i>so</i> wonderful in these arts, that because of their discovery the soul should be believed to be above the sun as well as all the stars, to surpass both in grandeur and essence the whole universe, of which these are parts. For what else do these assert that they can either declare or teach, than that we may learn to know the rules and differences of nouns, the intervals in the sounds of <i>different</i> tones, that we may speak persuasively in lawsuits, that we may measure the confines of the earth? Now, if the soul had brought these arts with it from the celestial regions, and it were impossible not to know them, all men would long before this be busied with them over all the earth, nor would any race of men be found which would not be equally and similarly instructed in them all. But now how few musicians, logicians, and geometricians are there in the world! how few orators, poets, critics! From which it is clear, as has been said pretty frequently, that these things were discovered under the pressure of time and circumstances, and that the soul did not fly hither divinely<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6802_2138524" id="P6802_2138524" name="P6802_2138524">137</a></sup> taught, because neither are all learned, nor can all learn; and<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6803_2138735" id="P6803_2138735" name="P6803_2138735">138</a></sup> there are very many among them somewhat deficient in shrewdness, and stupid, and they are constrained to apply themselves to learning <i>only</i> by fear of stripes.

And, that we may show you more clearly and distinctly what is the worth of man, whom you believe to be very like the higher power, conceive this idea; and because it can be done if we come into direct contact with it, let us conceive it just as if we came into contact.

Let us therefore provide a nurse also, who shall come to him always naked, ever silent, uttering not a word, and shall not open her mouth and lips to speak at all, but after suckling him, and doing what else is necessary, shall leave him fast asleep, and remain day and night before the closed doors; for it is usually necessary that the nurse's care should be near at hand, and that <i>she</i> should watch his varying motions. But when the child begins to need to be supported by more substantial food, let it be borne in by the same nurse, still undressed, and maintaining the same unbroken silence. Let the food, too, which is carried in be always precisely the same, with no difference in the material, and without being re-cooked by means of different flavours; but let it be either pottage of millet, or bread of spelt, or, in imitation of the ancients, chestnuts roasted in the hot ashes, or berries plucked from forest trees. Let him moreover, never learn to drink wine, and let nothing else be used to quench his thirst than pure cold water from the spring, and <i>that</i> if possible raised to his lips in the hollow of his hands.

But when I hear the soul spoken of as something extraordinary, as akin and very nigh to God, <i>and</i> as coming hither knowing all about past times, I would have it teach, not learn; and not go back to the rudiments, as the saying is, after being advanced in knowledge, but hold fast the truths it has learned when it enters its earthly body.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6848_2152943" id="P6848_2152943" name="P6848_2152943">176</a></sup> For unless it were so, how could it be discerned whether <i>the soul</i> recalls to memory or learns <i>for the first time</i> that which it hears; seeing that it is much easier to believe that it learns what it is unacquainted with, than that it has forgot what it knew but a little before, and that its power of recalling former things is lost through the interposition of the body?

For as a proportion established in bodies remains unaffected and secure, though it be lost to sight in a thousand cases; so must souls, if they are not material, as is asserted, retain their knowledge<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6851_2154022" id="P6851_2154022" name="P6851_2154022">179</a></sup> of the past, however thoroughly they may have been enclosed in bodies.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6852_2154134" id="P6852_2154134" name="P6852_2154134">180</a></sup> Moreover, the same reasoning not only shows that they are not incorporeal, but deprives them of all<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6853_2154317" id="P6853_2154317" name="P6853_2154317">181</a></sup> immortality even, and refers them to the limits within which life is usually closed. For whatever is led by some inducement to change and alter itself, so that it cannot retain its natural state, must of necessity be considered essentially passive. But that which is liable and exposed to suffering, is declared to be corruptible by that very capacity of suffering.</p>
<p>27. So then, if souls lose all their knowledge on being lettered with the body, they must experience something of such a nature that it makes them become blindly forgetful.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6855_2155008" id="P6855_2155008" name="P6855_2155008">182</a></sup> For they cannot, without becoming subject to anything whatever, either lay aside their knowledge while they maintain their natural state, or without change in themselves pass into a different state. Nay, we rather think that what is one, immortal, simple, in whatever it may be, must always retain its own nature, and that it neither should nor could be subject to anything, if indeed it purposes to endure and abide within the limits of true immortality. For all suffering is a passage for death and destruction, a way leading to the grave, and bringing an end of life which may not be escaped from; and if souls are liable to it, and yield to its influence and assaults, they indeed have life given to them only for present use, not as a secured possession,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6856_2155817" id="P6856_2155817" name="P6856_2155817">183</a></sup> although some come to other conclusions, and put faith in their own arguments with regard to so important a matter.</p>

For the same body which<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6861_2157339" id="P6861_2157339" name="P6861_2157339">187</a></sup> deprives of memory the soul which enters it,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6862_2157402" id="P6862_2157402" name="P6862_2157402">188</a></sup> should cause what is done within itself also to be wholly forgotten; for one cause cannot bring about two results, and <i>these</i> opposed to each other, so as to make some things to be forgotten, and allow others to be remembered by him who did them. But if souls, as you call them, are prevented and hindered by their <i>fleshly</i> members from recalling their former knowledge,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6863_2157795" id="P6863_2157795" name="P6863_2157795">189</a></sup> how do they remember what has been arranged<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6864_2158167" id="P6864_2158167" name="P6864_2158167">190</a></sup> in <i>these</i> very bodies, and know that they are spirits, and have no bodily substance, being exalted by their condition as immortal beings?<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6865_2158540" id="P6865_2158540" name="P6865_2158540">191</a></sup> <i>how do they know</i> what rank they hold in the universe, in what order they have been set apart <i>from other beings</i>? how they have come to these, the lowest parts of the universe? what properties they acquired, and from what circles,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6866_2158800" id="P6866_2158800" name="P6866_2158800">192</a></sup> in gliding along towards these regions? How, I say, do they know that they were very learned, and have lost their knowledge by the hindrance which their bodies afford them? For of this very thing also they should have been ignorant, whether their union with the body had brought any stain upon them; for to know what you were, and what to-day you are not, is no sign that you have lost your memory,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6867_2159226" id="P6867_2159226" name="P6867_2159226">193</a></sup> but a proof and evidence that it is quite sound.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6868_2159308" id="P6868_2159308" name="P6868_2159308">194</a></sup> </p>
<p>29. Now, since it is so, cease, I pray you, cease to rate trifling and unimportant things at immense values. Cease to place man in the upper ranks, since he is of the lowest; and in the highest orders, seeing that his person only is taken account of,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6870_2159599" id="P6870_2159599" name="P6870_2159599">195</a></sup> that he is needy, poverty-stricken in his house and dwelling,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6871_2159690" id="P6871_2159690" name="P6871_2159690">196</a></sup> and <i>was</i> never entitled to be declared of illustrious descent.

For what man is there, although of a disposition which ever shuns what is of bad repute and shameful, who, when he hears it said by very wise men that the soul is immortal, and not subject to the decrees of the fates,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6873_2160461" id="P6873_2160461" name="P6873_2160461">198</a></sup> would not throw himself headlong into all kinds of vice, <i>and</i> fearlessly<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6874_2160556" id="P6874_2160556" name="P6874_2160556">199</a></sup> engage in and set about unlawful things? <i>who</i> would not, in short, gratify his desires in all things demanded by his unbridled lust, strengthened even further by its security and freedom from punishment?<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6875_2160912" id="P6875_2160912" name="P6875_2160912">200</a></sup> For what will hinder him from doing so? The fear of a power above and divine judgment? And how shall he be overcome by any fear or dread who has been persuaded that he is immortal, just as the supreme God Himself, and that no sentence can be pronounced upon him by God, seeing that there is the same immortality in both, and that the one immortal being cannot be troubled by the other, which is <i>only</i> its equal?<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6876_2161366" id="P6876_2161366" name="P6876_2161366">201</a></sup> </p>
<p>30. But <i>will he not be terrified by</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6878_2161935" id="P6878_2161935" name="P6878_2161935">202</a></sup> the punishments in Hades, of which we have heard, assuming also, <i>as they do</i>, many forms of torture? And who<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6879_2162191" id="P6879_2162191" name="P6879_2162191">203</a></sup> will be so senseless and ignorant of consequences,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6880_2162317" id="P6880_2162317" name="P6880_2162317">204</a></sup> as to believe that to imperishable spirits either the darkness of Tartarus, or rivers of fire, or marshes with miry abysses, or wheels sent whirling through the air,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6881_2162526" id="P6881_2162526" name="P6881_2162526">205</a></sup> can in any wise do harm? For that which is beyond reach, and not subject to the laws of destruction, though it be surrounded by all the flames of the raging streams, be rolled in the mire, overwhelmed by the fall of overhanging rocks and by the overthrow of huge mountains, must remain safe and untouched without suffering any deadly harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, that conviction not only leads on to wickedness, from the very freedom to sin <i>which it suggests</i>, but even takes away the ground of philosophy itself, and asserts that it is vain to undertake its study, because of the difficulty of the work, which leads to no result. For if it is true that souls know no end, and are ever<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6883_2163243" id="P6883_2163243" name="P6883_2163243">206</a></sup> advancing with all generations, what danger is there in giving themselves up to the pleasures of sense-despising and neglecting the virtues by <i>regard</i> to which life is more stinted <i>in its pleasures</i>, and <i>becomes</i> less attractive-and in letting loose their boundless lust to range eagerly and unchecked through<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6884_2163618" id="P6884_2163618" name="P6884_2163618">207</a></sup> all kinds of debauchery? <i>Is it the danger</i> of being worn out by such pleasures, and corrupted by vicious effeminacy? And how can that be corrupted which is immortal, which always exists, and is subject to no suffering? <i>Is it the danger</i> of being polluted by foul and base deeds? And how can that be defiled which has no corporeal substance; or where can corruption seat itself, where there is no place on which the mark of this very corruption should fasten?</p>
<p>But again, if souls draw near to the gates of death,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6886_2164213" id="P6886_2164213" name="P6886_2164213">208</a></sup> as is laid down in the doctrine of Epicurus, in this case, too, there is no sufficient reason why philosophy should be sought out, even if it is true that by it<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6887_2164935" id="P6887_2164935" name="P6887_2164935">209</a></sup> souls are cleansed and made pure from all uncleanness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6888_2165133" id="P6888_2165133" name="P6888_2165133">210</a></sup> For if they all<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6889_2165377" id="P6889_2165377" name="P6889_2165377">211</a></sup> die, and even in the body<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6890_2165429" id="P6890_2165429" name="P6890_2165429">212</a></sup> the feeling characteristic of life perishes, and is lost;<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6891_2165498" id="P6891_2165498" name="P6891_2165498">213</a></sup> it is not only a very great mistake, but <i>shows</i> stupid blindness, to curb innate desires, to restrict your mode of life within narrow limits, not yield to your inclinations, and do what our passions have demanded and urged, since no rewards await you for so great toil when the day of death comes, and you shall be freed from the bonds of the body.</p>
<p>31. A certain neutral character, then, and undecided and doubtful nature of the soul, has made room for philosophy, and found out a reason for its being sought after: while, that is, that fellow<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6893_2166110" id="P6893_2166110" name="P6893_2166110">214</a></sup> is full of dread because of evil deeds of which he is guilty; another conceives great hopes if he shall do no evil, and pass his life in obedience to<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6894_2166337" id="P6894_2166337" name="P6894_2166337">215</a></sup> duty and justice. Thence it is that among learned men, and <i>men</i> endowed with excellent abilities, there is strife as to the nature of the soul, and some say that it is subject to death, and cannot take upon itself the divine substance; while others <i>maintain</i> that it is immortal, and cannot sink under the power of death.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6895_2166678" id="P6895_2166678" name="P6895_2166678">216</a></sup> But this is brought about by the law <i>of the soul's</i> neutral character:<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6896_2166794" id="P6896_2166794" name="P6896_2166794">217</a></sup> because, on the one hand, arguments present themselves to the one party by which it is found that the soul<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6897_2167497" id="P6897_2167497" name="P6897_2167497">218</a></sup> is capable of suffering, and perishable; and, on the other hand, are not wanting to their opponents, by which it is shown that the soul is divine and immortal.</p>

<p>46. But, to say the same things again and again,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7023_2202298" id="P7023_2202298" name="P7023_2202298">328</a></sup> let this belief, so monstrous and impious, be put far <i>from us</i>, that.

These things are unworthy of<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7028_2203173" id="P7028_2203173" name="P7028_2203173">333</a></sup> Him, and weaken the force of His greatness; and so far from His being believed to be their author, whoever imagines that man is sprung from Him is guilty of blasphemous impiety, <i>man</i>, a being miserable and wretched, who is sorry that he exists, hates and laments his state, and understands that he was produced for no other reason than lest evils should not have something<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7029_2203571" id="P7029_2203571" name="P7029_2203571">334</a></sup> through which to spread themselves, and that there might always be wretched ones by whose agonies some unseen and cruel power,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7030_2203723" id="P7030_2203723" name="P7030_2203723">335</a></sup> adverse to men, should be gratified.</p>
<p>47. But, you say, if God is not the parent and father of souls, by what sire have they been begotten, and how have they been produced? If you wish to hear unvarnished statements not spun out with vain ostentation of words, we, too,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7032_2204037" id="P7032_2204037" name="P7032_2204037">336</a></sup> admit that we are ignorant of this, do not know it;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7033_2204264" id="P7033_2204264" name="P7033_2204264">337</a></sup> and we hold that, to know so great a matter, is not only beyond the reach of our weakness and frailty, but <i>beyond that</i> also of all the powers which are in the world, and which have usurped the place of deities in men's belief. But are we bound to show whose they are, because we deny that they are God's? That by no means<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7034_2204650" id="P7034_2204650" name="P7034_2204650">338</a></sup> follows necessarily; for if we were to deny that flies, beetles, and bugs, dormice, weevils, and moths,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7035_2204822" id="P7035_2204822" name="P7035_2204822">339</a></sup> are made by the Almighty King, we should not be required in consequence to say who made and formed them; for without <i>incurring</i> any censure, we may not know who, indeed, gave them being, and <i>yet</i> assert that not by the Supreme<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7036_2205263" id="P7036_2205263" name="P7036_2205263">340</a></sup> Deity were <i>creatures</i> produced so useless, so needless, so purposeless,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7037_2205359" id="P7037_2205359" name="P7037_2205359">341</a></sup> nay more, at times even hurtful, and causing unavoidable injuries.</p>
<p>48. Here, too, in like manner, when we deny that souls are the offspring of God Supreme, it does not necessarily follow that we are bound to declare from what parent they have sprung, and by what causes they have been produced. For who prevents us from being either ignorant of the source from which they issued and came, or aware that they are not God's descendants? By what method, you say, in what way? Because it is most true and certain<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7039_2205905" id="P7039_2205905" name="P7039_2205905">342</a></sup> that, as has been pretty frequently said, nothing is effected, made, determined by the Supreme, except that which it is right and fitting should be done; except that which is complete and entire, and wholly perfect in its<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7040_2206217" id="P7040_2206217" name="P7040_2206217">343</a></sup> integrity. But further, we see that men, that is, these very souls-for what are men but souls bound to bodies?-themselves show by perversely falling into<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7041_2206419" id="P7041_2206419" name="P7041_2206419">344</a></sup> vice, times without number, that they belong to no patrician race, but have sprung from insignificant families. For we see some harsh, vicious, presumptuous, rash, reckless, blinded, false, dissemblers, liars, proud, overbearing, covetous, greedy, lustful, fickle, weak, and unable to observe their own precepts; but they would assuredly not be so, if their original goodness defended<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7042_2206990" id="P7042_2206990" name="P7042_2206990">345</a></sup> them, and they traced their honourable descent from the head of the universe.</p>
<p>49. But, you will say, there are good men also in the world,-wise, upright, of faultless and purest morals. We raise no question as to whether there ever were any such, in whom this very integrity which is spoken of was in nothing imperfect. Even if they are very honourable <i>men</i>, and have been worthy of praise, have reached the utmost height of perfection, and their life has never wavered and sunk into sin, yet we would have you tell us how many there are, or have been, that we may judge from their number whether a comparison<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7044_2207695" id="P7044_2207695" name="P7044_2207695">346</a></sup> has been made <i>which is</i> just and evenly balanced.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7045_2207822" id="P7045_2207822" name="P7045_2207822">347</a></sup> One, two, three, four, ten, twenty, a hundred, yet <i>are they</i> at least limited in number, and it may be within the reach of names.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7046_2208002" id="P7046_2208002" name="P7046_2208002">348</a></sup> But it is fitting that the human race should be rated and weighed, not by a very few good men, but by all the rest <i>as well</i>. For the part is in the whole, not the whole in a part; and that which is the whole should draw to it its parts, not the whole be brought to its parts. For what if you were to say that a man, robbed of the use of all his limbs, and shrieking in bitter agony,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7047_2208533" id="P7047_2208533" name="P7047_2208533">349</a></sup> was quite well, because in<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7048_2208617" id="P7048_2208617" name="P7048_2208617">350</a></sup> one little nail he suffered no pain? or that the earth is made of gold, because in one hillock there are a few small grains from which, when dissolved, gold is produced, and wonder excited at it when formed into a lump?<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7049_2208856" id="P7049_2208856" name="P7049_2208856">351</a></sup> The whole mass shows the nature of an element, not particles fine as air; nor does the sea become forthwith sweet, if you cast or throw into it a few drops of less bitter water, for that small quantity is swallowed up in its immense mass; and it must be esteemed, not merely of little importance, but <i>even</i> of none, because, being scattered throughout all, it is lost and cut off in the immensity of the vast body <i>of water</i>.</p>
<p>50. You say that there are good men in the human race; and perhaps, if we compare them with the very wicked, we may be led<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7051_2209480" id="P7051_2209480" name="P7051_2209480">352</a></sup> to believe that there are. Who are they, pray? Tell <i>us</i>. The philosophers, I suppose, who<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7052_2209635" id="P7052_2209635" name="P7052_2209635">353</a></sup> assert that they alone are most wise, and who have been uplifted with pride from the meaning attached to this name,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7053_2209856" id="P7053_2209856" name="P7053_2209856">354</a></sup> -those, forsooth, who are striving with their passions every day, and struggling to drive out, to expel deeply-rooted passions from their minds by the persistent<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7054_2210096" id="P7054_2210096" name="P7054_2210096">355</a></sup> opposition of their better qualities; who, that it may be impossible for them to be led into wickedness at the suggestion of some opportunity, shun riches and inheritances, that they may remove<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7055_2210472" id="P7055_2210472" name="P7055_2210472">356</a></sup> from themselves occasions of stumbling; but in doing this, and being solicitous about it, they show very clearly that <i>their</i> souls are, through their weakness, ready and prone to fall into vice. In our opinion, however, that which is good naturally, does not require to be either corrected or i reproved;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7056_2211000" id="P7056_2211000" name="P7056_2211000">357</a></sup> nay more, it should not know what evil is, if the nature of each kind would abide in its own integrity, for neither can two contraries be implanted in each other, nor can equality be contained in inequality, nor sweetness in bitterness. He, then, who struggles to amend the inborn depravity of his inclinations, shows most clearly that he is imperfect,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7057_2211605" id="P7057_2211605" name="P7057_2211605">358</a></sup> blameable, although he may strive with all zeal and stedfastness.</p>
<p>51. But you laugh at our reply, because, while we deny that souls are of royal descent, we do not, on the other hand, say in turn from what causes and beginnings they have sprung. But what kind of crime is it either to be ignorant of anything, or to confess quite openly that you do not know that of which you are ignorant? or whether does he rather seem to you most deserving of ridicule who assumes to himself no knowledge of some dark subject; or he who thinks that he<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7059_2212568" id="P7059_2212568" name="P7059_2212568">359</a></sup> knows most clearly that which transcends human knowledge, and which has been involved in dark obscurity? If the nature of everything were thoroughly considered, you too are in a position like that which you censure in our case. For you do not say anything <i>which has been</i> ascertained and set most clearly in the light of truth, because you say that souls descend from the Supreme Ruler Himself, and enter into the forms of men. For you conjecture, do not perceives<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7060_2213205" id="P7060_2213205" name="P7060_2213205">360</a></sup> <i>this</i>; surmise, do not actually know <i>it</i>; for if to know is to retain in the mind that which you have yourself seen or known, not one of those things which you affirm can you say that you have ever seen-that is, that souls descend from the abodes and regions above. You are therefore making use of conjecture, not trusting clear information. But what is conjecture, except a doubtful imagining of things, and directing of the mind upon nothing accessible? He, then, who conjectures, does not comprehend,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7061_2213728" id="P7061_2213728" name="P7061_2213728">361</a></sup> nor does he walk in the<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7062_2213773" id="P7062_2213773" name="P7062_2213773">362</a></sup> light of knowledge. But if this is true and certain in the opinion of proper and very wise judges, your conjectures, too, in which you trust, must be regarded as <i>showing your</i> ignorance.</p>
<p>52. And yet, lest you should suppose that none but yourselves can make use of conjectures and surmises, we too are able to bring them forward as well,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7064_2214136" id="P7064_2214136" name="P7064_2214136">363</a></sup> as your question is appropriate to either side.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7065_2214522" id="P7065_2214522" name="P7065_2214522">364</a></sup> Whence, you say, are men; and what or whence are the souls of these men? Whence, <i>we will ask</i>, are elephants, bulls, stags, mules,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7066_2214691" id="P7066_2214691" name="P7066_2214691">365</a></sup> asses? Whence lions, horses, dogs, wolves, panthers; and what or whence are the souls of these creatures? For it is not credible that from that Platonic cup,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7067_2214922" id="P7067_2214922" name="P7067_2214922">366</a></sup> which Timaeus prepares and mixes, either their souls came, or <i>that</i> the locust,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7068_2215060" id="P7068_2215060" name="P7068_2215060">367</a></sup> mouse, shrew, cockroach, frog, centipede, should be believed to have been quickened and to live, because<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7069_2215207" id="P7069_2215207" name="P7069_2215207">368</a></sup> they have a cause and origin of birth in<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7070_2215457" id="P7070_2215457" name="P7070_2215457">369</a></sup> the elements themselves, if there are <i>in these</i> secret and very little known means<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7071_2215560" id="P7071_2215560" name="P7071_2215560">370</a></sup> for producing the creatures which live in each of them. For we see that some of the wise say that the earth is mother of men, that others join with it water,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7072_2215735" id="P7072_2215735" name="P7072_2215735">371</a></sup> that others add to these breath of air, but that some say that the sun is their framer, and that, having been quickened by his rays, they are filled with the stir of life.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7073_2215948" id="P7073_2215948" name="P7073_2215948">372</a></sup> What if it is not these, and is something else another cause another method, another power, in fine, unheard of and unknown to us by name, which may have fashioned the human race, and connected it with things as established;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7074_2216380" id="P7074_2216380" name="P7074_2216380">373</a></sup> may it not be that men sprang up in this way, and that the cause of their birth does not go back to the Supreme God? For what reason do we suppose that the great Plato had-<i>a man </i>reverent and scrupulous in his wisdom-when he withdrew the fashioning of man from the highest God, and transferred it to some lesser <i>deities</i>. and when he would not have the souls of men formed<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7075_2216795" id="P7075_2216795" name="P7075_2216795">374</a></sup> of that pure mixture of which he had made the soul of the universe, except that he thought the forming of man unworthy of God, and the fashioning of a feeble being not beseeming His greatness and excellence?</p>
<p>53. Since this, then, is the case, we do nothing out of place or foolish in believing that the souls of men are of a neutral character, inasmuch as they have been produced by secondary beings,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7077_2218049" id="P7077_2218049" name="P7077_2218049">375</a></sup> made subject to the law of death, <i>and are</i> of little strength, and that perishable; <i>and that</i> they are gifted with immortality, if<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7078_2218396" id="P7078_2218396" name="P7078_2218396">376</a></sup> they rest their hope of so great a gift on God Supreme, who alone has power to grant such <i>blessings</i>, by putting away corruption. But this, <i>you say</i>, we are stupid in believing. What <i>is that</i> to you? <i>In so believing, we act</i> most absurdly, sillily. In what do we injure you, or what wrong do we do or inflict upon you, if we trust that Almighty God will take care of us when we leave<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7079_2218873" id="P7079_2218873" name="P7079_2218873">377</a></sup> our bodies, and from the jaws of hell, as is said, deliver us?</p>
<p>54. Can, then, anything be made, some one will say, without God's will? We<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7081_2219046" id="P7081_2219046" name="P7081_2219046">378</a></sup> must consider carefully, and examine with no little pains, test, while we think that we are honouring God<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7082_2219246" id="P7082_2219246" name="P7082_2219246">379</a></sup> by such a question, we fall into the opposite sin, doing despite to His supreme majesty. In what way, on what ground? Because, if all things are brought about by His will, and nothing in the world can either succeed or fail contrary to His pleasure, it follows of necessity that it should be understood that<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7083_2219644" id="P7083_2219644" name="P7083_2219644">380</a></sup> all evils, too, arise by His will. But if, on the contrary, we chose to say that He is privy to and produces no evil, not referring to Him the causes of very wicked deeds, the worst things will begin to seem to be done either against His will, or, a monstrous thing to say, while He knows it not, <i>but</i> is ignorant and unaware of them. But, again, if we choose to say that there are no evils, as we find some have believed and held, all races will cry out against <i>us</i> and all nations together, showing us their sufferings, and the various kinds of dangers with which the human race is every moment<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7084_2220299" id="P7084_2220299" name="P7084_2220299">381</a></sup> distressed and afflicted. Then they will ask of us, Why, if there are no evils, do you refrain from certain deeds and actions? Why do you not do all that eager lust has required or demanded? Why, finally, do you establish punishments by terrible laws for the guilty?

But when, overcome, we agree that there are these things,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7088_2221478" id="P7088_2221478" name="P7088_2221478">384</a></sup> and expressly allow that all human affairs are full of them, they will next ask, Why, then, the Almighty God does not take away these evils, but suffers them to exist and to go on without ceasing through all the ages?<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7089_2221715" id="P7089_2221715" name="P7089_2221715">385</a></sup> If we have learned of God the Supreme Ruler, and have resolved not to wander in a maze of impious and mad conjectures, we must answer that we do not know these things, and have never sought and striven to know things which could be grasped by no powers <i>which we have</i>, and that we, even thinking it<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7090_2222070" id="P7090_2222070" name="P7090_2222070">386</a></sup> preferable, rather remain in ignorance and want of knowledge than say that without God nothing is made, so that it should be understood that by His will<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7091_2222352" id="P7091_2222352" name="P7091_2222352">387</a></sup> He is at once both the source of evil<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7092_2222954" id="P7092_2222954" name="P7092_2222954">388</a></sup> and the occasion of countless miseries. Whence then, you will say, are all these evils? From the elements, say the wise, and from their dissimilarity; but how it is possible that things which have not feeling and judgment should be held to be wicked or criminal; or that he should not rather be wicked and criminal, who, to bring about some result, took what was afterwards to become very bad and hurtful,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7093_2223371" id="P7093_2223371" name="P7093_2223371">389</a></sup> -is for them to consider, who make the assertion. What, then, do we say? whence? There is no necessity that we should answer, for whether we are able to say <i>whence evil springs</i>, or our power fails us, and we are unable, in either case it is a small matter in our opinion; nor do we hold it of much importance either to know or to be ignorant of it, being content to have laid down but one thing,-that nothing proceeds from God Supreme which is hurtful and pernicious. This we are assured of, this we know, on this one truth of knowledge and science we take our stand,-that nothing is made by Him except that which is for the well-being of all, which is agreeable, which is very full of love and joy and gladness, which has unbounded and imperishable pleasures, which every one may ask in all his prayers to befall him, and think that otherwise<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7094_2224367" id="P7094_2224367" name="P7094_2224367">390</a></sup> life is pernicious and fatal.</p>
<p>56. As for all the other things which are usually dwelt upon in inquiries and discussions-from what parents they have sprung, or by whom they are produced-we neither strive to know,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7096_2224633" id="P7096_2224633" name="P7096_2224633">391</a></sup> nor care to inquire or examine: we leave all things to their own causes, and do not consider that they have been connected and associated with that which we desire should befall us.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7097_2225143" id="P7097_2225143" name="P7097_2225143">392</a></sup> For what is there which men of ability do not dare to overthrow, to destroy,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7098_2225591" id="P7098_2225591" name="P7098_2225591">393</a></sup> from love of contradiction, although that which they attempt to invalidate is unobjectionable<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7099_2225788" id="P7099_2225788" name="P7099_2225788">394</a></sup> and manifest, and evidently bears the stamp of truth? Or what, again, can they not maintain with plausible arguments, although it may be very manifestly untrue, although it may be a plain and evident falsehood? For when a man has persuaded himself that there is or is not something, he likes to affirm what he thinks, and to show greater subtlety than others, especially if the subject discussed is out of the ordinary track, and by nature abstruse and obscure.<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7100_2226271" id="P7100_2226271" name="P7100_2226271">395</a></sup> Some of the wise think that the world was not created, and will never perish;<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7101_2226564" id="P7101_2226564" name="P7101_2226564">396</a></sup> some that it is immortal, although they say that it was created and made;<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7102_2227047" id="P7102_2227047" name="P7102_2227047">397</a></sup> while a third party have chosen to say that it both was created and made, and will perish as other things must.<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7103_2227186" id="P7103_2227186" name="P7103_2227186">398</a></sup> And while of these three opinions one only must be true, they nevertheless all find arguments by which at once to uphold their own doctrines, and undermine and overthrow the dogmas of others. Some teach and declare that this same <i>world</i> is composed of four elements, others of two,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7104_2227737" id="P7104_2227737" name="P7104_2227737">399</a></sup> a third party of one; some say that <i>it is composed of</i> none of these, and that atoms are that from which it is formed,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7105_2228378" id="P7105_2228378" name="P7105_2228378">400</a></sup> and its primary origin. And since of these opinions only one is true, but<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7106_2228481" id="P7106_2228481" name="P7106_2228481">401</a></sup> not one of them certain, here too, in like manner, arguments present themselves to all with which they may both establish the truth of what they say, and show that there are some things false<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7107_2228791" id="P7107_2228791" name="P7107_2228791">402</a></sup> in the others' opinions. So, too, some utterly deny the existence of the gods; others say that they are lost in doubt as to whether they exist anywhere; others, however, <i>say</i> that they do exist, but do not trouble themselves about human things; nay others maintain that they both take part in the affairs of men, and guide the course of earthly events.<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7108_2229183" id="P7108_2229183" name="P7108_2229183">403</a></sup> </p>
<p>57. While, then, this is the case, and it cannot but be that only one of all these opinions is true, they all nevertheless make use of arguments in striving with each other,-and not one of them is without something plausible to say, whether in affirming his own views, or objecting to the opinions of others. In exactly the same way is the condition of souls discussed. For I this one thinks that they both are immortal, and survive the end of our earthly life; that one believes that they do not survive, but perish with the bodies themselves: the opinion of another, however, is that they suffer nothing immediately, but that, after the <i>form</i> of man has been laid aside, they are allowed to live a little longer,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7110_2229954" id="P7110_2229954" name="P7110_2229954">404</a></sup> <i>and</i> then come under the power of death. And while all these opinions cannot be alike true, yet all <i>who hold them</i> so support their case by strong and very weighty arguments, that you cannot find out anything which seems false to you, although on every side you see that things are being said altogether at variance with each other, and inconsistent from their opposition to each other;<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7111_2230525" id="P7111_2230525" name="P7111_2230525">405</a></sup> which assuredly would not happen, if man s curiosity could reach any certainty, or if that which seemed <i>to one</i> to have been really discovered, was attested by the approval of all the others. It is therefore wholly<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7112_2231052" id="P7112_2231052" name="P7112_2231052">406</a></sup> vain, a useless task, to bring forward something as though you knew it, or to wish to assert that you know that which, although it should be true, you see can be refuted; or to receive that as true which it may be is not, and is brought forward as if by men raving. And it is rightly so, for we do not weigh and guess at<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7113_2231412" id="P7113_2231412" name="P7113_2231412">407</a></sup> divine things by divine, but by human methods; and just as we think that anything should have been made, so we assert that it must be.</p>
<p>58. What, then, are we alone ignorant? do we alone not know who is the creator, who the former of souls, what cause fashioned man, whence ills have broken forth, or why the Supreme Ruler allows them both to exist and be perpetrated, and does not drive them from the world? have you, indeed, ascertained and learned any of these things with certainty?

To all, He says, the fountain of life is open,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7162_2246945" id="P7162_2246945" name="P7162_2246945">449</a></sup> and no one is hindered or kept back from drinking.<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7163_2247423" id="P7163_2247423" name="P7163_2247423">450</a></sup> If you are so fastidious as to spurn the kindly<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7164_2247509" id="P7164_2247509" name="P7164_2247509">451</a></sup> offered gift, nay, more, if your wisdom is so great that you term those things which are offered by Christ ridiculous and absurd, why should He keep on inviting<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7165_2247702" id="P7165_2247702" name="P7165_2247702">452</a></sup> you, while His only duty is to make the enjoyment of His bounty depend upon your own free choice?<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7166_2248093" id="P7166_2248093" name="P7166_2248093">453</a></sup> God, Plato says, does not cause any one to choose his lot in life;<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7167_2248217" id="P7167_2248217" name="P7167_2248217">454</a></sup> nor can another's choice be rightly attributed to any one, since freedom of choice was put in His power who made it. Must you be even implored to deign to accept the gift of salvation from God; and must God's gracious mercy be poured into your bosom while you reject it with disdain, and flee very far from it? Do you choose to take what is offered, and turn it to your own advantage? You will <i>in that case</i> have consulted your own interests. Do you reject with disdain, lightly esteem, and despise it? You will <i>in this case</i> have robbed yourself of the benefit of the gift.<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7168_2248921" id="P7168_2248921" name="P7168_2248921">455</a></sup> God compels no one, terrifies no one with overpowering fear. For our salvation is not necessary to Him, so that He would gain anything or suffer any loss, if He either made us divine,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7169_2249276" id="P7169_2249276" name="P7169_2249276">456</a></sup> or allowed us to be annihilated and destroyed by corruption.</p>
<p>65. Nay, <i>my opponent says</i>, if God is powerful, merciful, willing to save us, let Him change our dispositions, and compel us to trust in His promises. This, then, is violence, not kindness nor the bounty of the Supreme God, but a childish and vain<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7171_2249680" id="P7171_2249680" name="P7171_2249680">457</a></sup> strife in seeking to get the mastery. For what is so unjust as to force men who are reluctant and unwilling, to reverse their inclinations; to impress forcibly on their minds what they are unwilling <i>to receive</i>, and shrink from; to injure before benefiting, and to bring to another way of thinking and feeling, by taking away the former? You who wish yourself to be changed,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7172_2250193" id="P7172_2250193" name="P7172_2250193">458</a></sup> and to suffer violence, that you may do and may be compelled to take to yourself that which you do not wish, why do you refuse of your own accord to select that which you wish to do, when changed and transformed?

Unless, then, <i>my opponent says</i>, I shall be a Christian, I cannot hope for salvation. It is just as you yourself say. For, to bring salvation and impart to souls what should be bestowed and must be added, <i>Christ</i> alone has had given into His charge and entrusted<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7175_2251365" id="P7175_2251365" name="P7175_2251365">461</a></sup> to Him by God the Father, the remote and more secret causes being so disposed. For, as with you, certain gods have fixed offices, privileges, powers, and you do not ask from any of them what is not in his power and permitted to him, so it is the right of<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7176_2251891" id="P7176_2251891" name="P7176_2251891">462</a></sup> Christ alone to give salvation to souls, and assign them everlasting life. For if you believe that father Bacchus can give a good vintage, <i>but</i> cannot give relief from sickness; if <i>you believe</i> that Ceres <i>can give</i> good crops, Aesculapius health, Neptune one thing, Juno<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7177_2252179" id="P7177_2252179" name="P7177_2252179">463</a></sup> another, that Fortune, Mercury, Vulcan, are each the giver of a fixed and particular thing,-this, too, you must needs receive from us,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7178_2252383" id="P7178_2252383" name="P7178_2252383">464</a></sup> that souls can receive from no one life and salvation, except from Him to whom the Supreme Ruler gave this charge and duty. The Almighty Master of the world has determined that this should be the way of salvation,-this the door, so to say, of life; by Him<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7179_2252659" id="P7179_2252659" name="P7179_2252659">465</a></sup> alone is there access to the light: nor may men either creep in or enter elsewhere, all other <i>ways</i> being shut up and secured by an impenetrable barrier.</p>
<p>66. So, then, even if you are pure, and have been cleansed from every stain of vice, have won over and charmed<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7181_2253186" id="P7181_2253186" name="P7181_2253186">466</a></sup> those powers not to shut the ways against you and bar your passage when returning to heaven, by no efforts will you be able to reach the prize of immortality, unless by Christ's gift you have perceived what constitutes this very immortality, and have been allowed to enter on the true life. For as to that with which you have been in the habit of taunting us, that our religion is new,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7182_2253593" id="P7182_2253593" name="P7182_2253593">467</a></sup> and arose a few days ago, almost, and that you could not abandon the ancient faith which you had inherited from your fathers, and pass over to barbarous and foreign rites, this is urged wholly without reason. For what if in this way we chose to blame the preceding, even the most ancient ages, because when they discovered how to raise crops,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7183_2253961" id="P7183_2253961" name="P7183_2253961">468</a></sup> they despised acorns, and rejected with scorn the wild strawberry; because they ceased to be covered with the bark of trees and clad in the hides of wild beasts, after that garments of cloth were devised, more useful and convenient in wearing; or because, when houses were built, and more comfortable dwellings erected, they did not cling to their ancient huts, and did not prefer to remain nuder rocks and caves like the beasts of the field? It is a disposition possessed by all, and impressed on us almost from our cradles even, to prefer good things to bad, useful to useless things, and to pursue and seek that with more pleasure which has been generally regarded<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7184_2254666" id="P7184_2254666" name="P7184_2254666">469</a></sup> as more <i>than usually</i> precious, and to set on that our hopes for prosperity and favourable circumstances.</p>
<p>67. Therefore, when you urge against us that we turn away from the religion<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7186_2255033" id="P7186_2255033" name="P7186_2255033">470</a></sup> of past <i>ages</i>, it is fitting that you should examine why it is done, not what is crone, and not set before you what we have left, but observe especially what we have followed. For if it is a fault or crime to change an opinion, and pass from ancient customs to new conditions and desires, this accusation holds against you too, who have so often changed your habits and mode of life, who have gone over to other customs and ceremonies, so that you are condemned by<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7187_2255660" id="P7187_2255660" name="P7187_2255660">471</a></sup> past ages <i>as well as we.</i> Do you indeed have the people distributed into five<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7188_2255778" id="P7188_2255778" name="P7188_2255778">472</a></sup> classes, as your ancestors once had?

When you marry, do you spread the couch with a toga, and invoke the <i>genii</i> of husbands? do you arrange the hair of brides with the <i>hasta caelibaris</i>? do you bear the maidens' garments to the temple of Fortuna Virginalis? Do your matrons work in the halls of your houses, showing their industry openly do they refrain from drinking wine? are their friends and relations allowed to kiss them, in order to show that they are sober and temperate?</p>
<p>68. On the Alban hill, it was not allowed in ancient times to sacrifice any but snow-white bulls: have you not changed that custom and religious observance, and <i>has it not been</i> enacted by decree of the senate, that reddish ones may be offered? While during the reigns of Romulus and Pompilius the inner parts, having been quite thoroughly cooked and softened, were burnt up in <i>sacrificing</i> to the gods, did you not begin, under king Tullius,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7195_2258484" id="P7195_2258484" name="P7195_2258484">478</a></sup> to hold them out half-raw and slightly warm, paying no regard to the former usage? While before the arrival of Hercules in Italy supplication was made to father Dis and Saturn with the heads of men by Apollo's advice; have you not, in like manner, changed this custom too, by means of cunning deceit and ambiguous names?<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7196_2258890" id="P7196_2258890" name="P7196_2258890">479</a></sup> Since, then, yourselves also have followed at one time these customs, at another different laws, and have repudiated and rejected many things on either perceiving your mistakes or seeing something better, what have we done contrary to common sense and the discretion all men have, if we have chosen what is greater and more certain, and have not suffered ourselves to be held back by unreasoning respect for impostures?</p>
<p>69. But our name is new, <i>we are told</i>, and the religion which we follow arose but a few days ago. Granting for the present that what you urge against us is not untrue, what is there, <i>I would ask</i>, among the affairs of men that is either done by bodily exertion and manual labour, or attained by the mind's learning and knowledge, which did not begin at some time, and pass into general use and practice since then? Medicine,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7198_2259752" id="P7198_2259752" name="P7198_2259752">480</a></sup> philosophy, music, and all the other arts by which social life has been built up and refined,-were these born with men, and did they not rather begin to be pursued, understood, and practised lately, nay, rather, but a short time since? Before the Etruscan Tages saw the<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7199_2260315" id="P7199_2260315" name="P7199_2260315">481</a></sup> light, did any one know or trouble himself to know and learn what meaning there was in the fall of thunderbolts, or in the veins of the victims sacrificed?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7200_2260509" id="P7200_2260509" name="P7200_2260509">482</a></sup> When did the motion of the stars or the art of calculating nativities begin to be known? Was it not after Theutis<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7201_2260665" id="P7201_2260665" name="P7201_2260665">483</a></sup> the Egyptian; or after Atlas, as some say, the bearer, supporter, stay, <i>and</i> prop of the skies?</p>
<p>70. But why do <i>I speak</i> of these trivial things? The immortal gods themselves, whose temples you now enter <i>with reverence</i>, whose deity you suppliantly adore, did they not at certain times, as is handed down by your writings and traditions, begin to be, to be known and to be invoked by names and titles which were given to them? For if it is true that Jupiter with his brothers was born of Saturn and his wife, before Ops was married and bore children Jupiter had not existed both the Supreme and the Stygian,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7203_2261354" id="P7203_2261354" name="P7203_2261354">484</a></sup> no, nor the lord of the sea, nor Juno, nay more, no one inhabited the heavenly seats except the two parents; but from their union<i> the other gods</i> were conceived and born, and breathed the breath of life. So, then, at a certain time the god Jupiter began to be, at a certain time to merit worship and sacrifices, at a certain time to be set above his brothers in power.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7204_2261742" id="P7204_2261742" name="P7204_2261742">485</a></sup> But, again, if Liber, Venus, Diana, Mercury, Apollo, Hercules, the Muses, the Tyndarian brothers,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7205_2261851" id="P7205_2261851" name="P7205_2261851">486</a></sup> and Vulcan the lord of fire, were begotten by father Jupiter, and born of a parent sprung from Saturn, before that Memory, Alcmena, Maia, Juno, Latona, Leda, Dione, and Semele also bore children to Diespiter; these <i>deities</i>, too, were nowhere in the world, nor in any part of the universe, but by Jupiter's embraces they were begotten and born, and began to have some sense of their own existence. So then, these, too, began to be at a certain time, and to be summoned among the gods to the sacred rites. This we say, in like manner, of Minerva. For if, as you assert, she burst forth from Jupiter's head ungenerated,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7206_2262518" id="P7206_2262518" name="P7206_2262518">487</a></sup> before Jupiter was begotten, and received in his mother's womb the shape and outline of his body,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7207_2262656" id="P7207_2262656" name="P7207_2262656">488</a></sup> it is quite certain that Minerva did not exist, and was not reckoned among things or as existing at all; but from Jove's head she was born, and began to have a real existence. She therefore has an origin at the first, and began to be called a goddess at a certain time, to be set up in temples, and to be consecrated by the inviolable obligations of religion. Now as this is the case, when you talk of the novelty of our religion, does your own not come into your thoughts, and do you not take care to examine when your gods sprung up,-what origins, what causes they have, or from what stocks they have burst forth and sprung? But how shameful how shameless it is to censure that in another which you see that you do yourself,-to take occasion to revile and accuse <i>others</i> for things which can be retorted upon you in turn!</p>
<p>71. But our rites are<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7209_2263548" id="P7209_2263548" name="P7209_2263548">489</a></sup> new; yours are ancient, and of excessive antiquity, <i>we are told</i>. And what help does that give you, or how does it damage our cause and argument? The belief<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7210_2263734" id="P7210_2263734" name="P7210_2263734">490</a></sup> which we hold is new; some day even it, too, will become old: yours is old; but when it arose, it was new and unheard of. The credibility of a religion, however, must not be determined by its age, but by its divinity; and you should consider not when, but what you began to worship. Four hundred years ago, <i>my opponent says</i>, your religion did not exist. And two thousand years ago, <i>I reply</i>, your gods did not exist. By what reckoning, <i>you ask</i>, or by what calculations, can that be inferred? They are not difficult, not intricate, but can be seen by any one who will take them in hand even, as the saying is. Who begot Jupiter and his brothers? Saturn with Ops, as you relate, sprung from Coelus and Hecate. Who begot Picus, the father of Faunus and grandfather of Latinus? Saturn, as you again hand down by your books and teachers? Therefore, if this is the case, Picus and Jupiter are in consequence united by the bond of kinship, inasmuch as they are sprung from one stock and race. It is clear, then, that what we say is true. How many steps are there in coming down<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7211_2264826" id="P7211_2264826" name="P7211_2264826">491</a></sup> from Jupiter and Picus to Latinus? Three, as the line of succession shows. Will you suppose Faunus, Latinus, and Picus to have each lived a hundred and twenty years, for beyond this it is that man's life cannot be prolonged? The estimation is well grounded and clear. There are, then, three hundred and sixty years garter these?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7212_2265204" id="P7212_2265204" name="P7212_2265204">492</a></sup> It is just as the calculation shows. Whose father-in-law was Latinus? Aeneas'. Whose father <i>was</i> he?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7213_2265336" id="P7213_2265336" name="P7213_2265336">493</a></sup> <i>He was father</i> of the founder of the town Alba. How many years did kings reign in Alba? Four hundred and twenty almost. Of what age is the city Rome shown to be in the annals? It reckons ten<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7214_2265747" id="P7214_2265747" name="P7214_2265747">494</a></sup> hundred and fifty years, or not much less. So, then, from Jupiter, who is the brother of Picus and father of the other and lesser gods, down to the present time, there are nearly, or to add a little to the time, altogether, two thousand years. Now since this cannot be contradicted, not only is the religion to which you adhere shown to have sprung up lately; but <i>it is also shown</i> that the gods themselves, to whom you heap up bulls and other victims at the risk of bringing on disease, are young and little children, who should still be fed with their mothers' milk.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7215_2266591" id="P7215_2266591" name="P7215_2266591">495</a></sup> </p>
<p>72. But your religion precedes ours by many years, and is therefore, <i>you say</i>, truer, because it has been supported by the authority of antiquity. And of what avail is it that it should precede <i>ours</i> as many years as you please, since it began at a certain time? or what<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7217_2266918" id="P7217_2266918" name="P7217_2266918">496</a></sup> are two thousand years, compared with so many thousands of ages? And yet, lest we should seem to betray <i>our</i> cause by so long neglect, say, if it does not annoy you, does the Almighty and Supreme God seem to you to be something new; and do those who adore and worship Him <i>seem to you</i> to support and introduce an unheard-of, unknown, and upstart religion? Is there anything older than Him? or can anything be found preceding Him in being,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7218_2267385" id="P7218_2267385" name="P7218_2267385">497</a></sup> time, name? Is not He alone uncreated, immortal, and everlasting? Who is the head<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7219_2267484" id="P7219_2267484" name="P7219_2267484">498</a></sup> and fountain of things? is not He? To whom does eternity owe its name? is it not to Him? Is it not because He is everlasting, that the ages go on without end? This is beyond doubt, and true: <i>the religion</i> which we follow is not new, then, but we have been late in learning what we should follow and revere, or where we should both fix our hope of salvation, and employ the aid <i>given</i> to save us. For He had not yet shone forth who was to point out the way to those wandering <i>from it,</i> and give the light of knowledge to those who were lying in the deepest darkness, and dispel the blindness of their ignorance.</p>
<p>73. But are we alone in this position?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7221_2268264" id="P7221_2268264" name="P7221_2268264">499</a></sup> What! have you not introduced into the number of your gods the Egyptian deities named Serapis and Isis, since the consulship of Piso and Gabinius?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7222_2268537" id="P7222_2268537" name="P7222_2268537">500</a></sup> What! did you not begin both to know and be acquainted with, and to worship with remarkable honours, the Phrygian mother-who, it is said, was first set up as a goddess by Midas or Dardanus-when Hannibal, the Carthaginian, was plundering Italy and aiming at the empire of the world?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7223_2269319" id="P7223_2269319" name="P7223_2269319">501</a></sup> Are not the sacred rites of mother Ceres, which were adopted but a little while ago, called Graeca because they were unknown to you, their name bearing witness to their novelty? Is it not said<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7224_2269532" id="P7224_2269532" name="P7224_2269532">502</a></sup> in the writings of the learned, that the rituals of Numa Pompilius do not contain the name of Apollo? Now it is clear and manifest from this, that he, too, was unknown to you. but that at some time afterwards he began to be known also. If any one, therefore, should ask yon why you have so lately begun to worship those deities whom we mentioned just now, it is certain that you will reply, either because we were C lately not aware that they were gods, or because we have now been warned by the seers, or because, in very trying circumstances, we have been preserved by their favour and help. But if you think that this is well said by you, you must consider that, on our part, a similar reply has been made. Our religion has sprung up just now; for now He has arrived who was sent to declare it to us, to bring <i>us</i> to its truth; to show what God is; to summon us from mere conjectures, to His worship.</p>
<p>74. And why, <i>my, opponent says</i>, did God, the Ruler and Lord <i>of the universe</i>, determine that a Saviour, Christ, should be sent to you from the heights of heaven a few hours ago, as it is said? We ask you too, on the other hand, what cause, what reason is there that the seasons sometimes do not recur at their own months, but that winter, summer, and autumn come too late? why, after the crops have been dried up and the corn<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7226_2270885" id="P7226_2270885" name="P7226_2270885">503</a></sup> has perished, showers sometimes fall which should have dropped on them while yet uninjured, and made provision for the wants of the time? Nay, this we rather ask, why, if it were fitting that Hercules should be born, Aesculapius, Mercury, Liber, and some others, that they might be both added to the assemblies of the gods, and might do men some service,-why they were produced so late by Jupiter, that only later ages should know them, while the past ages<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7227_2271353" id="P7227_2271353" name="P7227_2271353">504</a></sup> of those who went before knew them not? You will say that there was some reason. There was then some reason here also that the Saviour of our race came not lately, but to-day. What, then, you ask, is the reason? We do not deny that we do not know. For it is not within the power of any one to see the mind of God, or the way in which He has arranged His plans.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7228_2271740" id="P7228_2271740" name="P7228_2271740">505</a></sup> Man, a blind creature, and not knowing himself even, can<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7229_2271820" id="P7229_2271820" name="P7229_2271820">506</a></sup> in no way learn what should happen, when, or what its nature is: the Father Himself, the Governor and Lord of all, alone knows. Nor, if I have been unable to disclose to you the causes why something is done in this way or that, does it straightway follow, that what has been done becomes not done, and that a thing becomes incredible, which has been shown to be beyond doubt by such<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7230_2272331" id="P7230_2272331" name="P7230_2272331">507</a></sup> virtues and<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7231_2272376" id="P7231_2272376" name="P7231_2272376">508</a></sup> powers.</p>
<p>75. You may object and rejoin, Why was the Saviour sent forth so late? In unbounded, eternal ages, <i>we reply</i>, nothing whatever should be spoken of as late. For where there is no end and no beginning, nothing is too soon,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7233_2272931" id="P7233_2272931" name="P7233_2272931">509</a></sup> nothing too late. For time is perceived from its beginnings and endings, which an unbroken line and endless<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7234_2273145" id="P7234_2273145" name="P7234_2273145">510</a></sup> succession of ages cannot have. For what if the things themselves to which it was necessary to bring help, required that as a fitting time? For what if the condition of antiquity was different from that of later times? What if it was necessary to give help to the men of old in one way, to provide for their descendants in another? Do ye not hear your own writings read, telling that there were once men <i>who were</i> demi-gods, heroes with immense and huge bodies? Do you not read that infants on their mothers' breasts shrieked like. Stentors,<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7235_2273787" id="P7235_2273787" name="P7235_2273787">511</a></sup> whose bones, when dug up in different parts of the earth, have made the discoverers almost doubt that they were the remains of human limbs? So, then, it may be that Almighty God, the only God, sent forth Christ then indeed, after that the human race, <i>becoming</i> feebler, weaker, began to be such as we are. If that which has been done now could have been done thousands of years ago, the Supreme Ruler would have done it; or if it had been proper, that what has been done now should be accomplished as many thousands after this, nothing compelled God to anticipate the necessary lapse<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7236_2274583" id="P7236_2274583" name="P7236_2274583">512</a></sup> of time. His plans<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7237_2274626" id="P7237_2274626" name="P7237_2274626">513</a></sup> are executed in fixed ways; and that which has been once decided on, can in no wise be changed again.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7238_2274751" id="P7238_2274751" name="P7238_2274751">514</a></sup> </p>
<p>76. Inasmuch then, you say, as you serve the Almighty God, and trust that He cares for your safety and salvation, why does He suffer you to be exposed to such storms of persecution, and to undergo all kinds of punishments and tortures? Let us, too, ask in reply, why, seeing that you worship so great and so innumerable gods, and build temples to them, fashion images of gold, sacrifice herds of animals, <i>and</i> all heap up<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7240_2275219" id="P7240_2275219" name="P7240_2275219">515</a></sup> boxfuls of incense on the already loaded altars, why you live subject to so many dangers and storms <i>of calamity</i>, with which many fatal misfortunes vex you every day? Why, I say, do your gods neglect to avert from you so many kinds of disease and sickness, shipwrecks, downfalls, conflagrations, pestilences, barrenness, loss of children, and confiscation of goods, discords, wars, enmities, captures of cities, and the slavery of those who are robbed of their rights of free birth?<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7241_2275787" id="P7241_2275787" name="P7241_2275787">516</a></sup> But, <i>my opponent says</i>, in such mischances we, too, are in no wise helped by God. The cause is plain and manifest. For no hope has been held out to us with respect to this life, nor has any help been promised or<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7242_2276060" id="P7242_2276060" name="P7242_2276060">517</a></sup> aid decreed us for what belongs to the husk of this flesh,-nay, more, we have been taught to esteem and value lightly all the threats of fortune, whatever they be; and if ever any very grievous calamity has assailed <i>us</i>, to count as pleasant in <i>that</i> misfortune<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7243_2276340" id="P7243_2276340" name="P7243_2276340">518</a></sup> the end which must follow, and not to fear or flee from it, that we may be the more easily released from the bonds of the body, and escape from our darkness and<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7244_2276683" id="P7244_2276683" name="P7244_2276683">519</a></sup> blindness.</p>
<p>77. Therefore that bitterness of persecution of which you speak is our deliverance and not persecution, and our ill-treatment will not bring evil upon us, but will lead us to the light of liberty. As if some senseless and stupid fellow were to think that he never punished a man who had been put into prison<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7246_2277026" id="P7246_2277026" name="P7246_2277026">520</a></sup> with severity and cruelty, unless he were to rage against the very prison, break its stones in pieces, and burn its roof, its wall, its doors; and strip, overthrow, and dash to the ground its other parts, not knowing that thus he was giving light to him whom he seemed to be injuring, and was taking from him the accursed darkness: in like manner, you too, by the flames, banishments, tortures, and monsters with which you tear in pieces and rend asunder our bodies, do not rob us of life, but relieve us of our skins, not knowing that, as far as you assault and seek to rage against these our shadows and forms, so far you free us from pressing and heavy chains, and cutting our bonds, make us fly up to the light.</p>
<p>78. Wherefore, O men, refrain from obstructing what you hope for by vain questions; nor should you, if anything is otherwise than you think, trust your own opinions rather than that which should be reverenced.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7248_2278231" id="P7248_2278231" name="P7248_2278231">521</a></sup> The times, full of dangers, urge us, and fatal penalties threaten us; let us flee for safety to God our Saviour, without demanding the reason of the offered gift. When that at stake is our souls' salvation and our own interests, something must be done even without reason, as Arrhianus approves of Epictetus having said.<sup><a href="footnote/fn72.htm#P7249_2278589" id="P7249_2278589" name="P7249_2278589">522</a></sup> We doubt, we hesitate, and suspect the credibility of what is said; let us commit ourselves to God, and let not our incredulity prevail more with us than the greatness of His name and power, lest, while we are seeking out arguments for ourselves, through which that may seem false which we do not wish and deny to be true, the last day steal upon us, and we be found in the jaws of our enemy, death. </p>
