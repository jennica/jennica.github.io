<sup>1 </sup>[This reading contains an obvious error, and would be readily altered by students or copyists; and one manuscript gives "keeper of the prison." Chrysostom not unfrequently makes slips in quoting from memory, as do most preachers. He is here doubtless thinking of Crispus. (Acts xviii. 8.) Below, in paragraph 3, he has it right.-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1546_879729"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>[All documents for New Testament give "in behalf of Christ." Chrysostom was quoting from memory.-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1547_880110"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[Scholars now generally understand the praetorian camp or the praetorian guard. See Lightfoot here.-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1548_880258"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>His statement amounts to this, that the present epistle was written in St. Paul's first imprisonment, when Timothy was with him, for that the second to Timothy was written in a second imprisonment, from which he was only released by martyrdom. The "first defence" belongs to the second imprisonment. Between the two, it is probable that he visited the Philippians, according to his intention.</p>
<p><a name="P1549_881519"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>The <i>if</i> is omitted, perhaps in order to put the objection in a strong light.</p>
<p><a name="P1550_881902"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>[Correct New Testament text, "trust."-J. A. B.] </p>
<p><a name="P1552_883106"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>[The altered text and most editions add "but had then done it," through misunderstanding of the rather obscure connection.-J.A.B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1555_886499"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>[Such a digressive and awkward sentence is of course smoothed out in the altered text, but is perfectly natural in a freely spoken discourse.-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1556_887204"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>The same word is here used for "mercy" and "alms." [And it is quoted from the Sept. in the plural, "mercies," or "almsgivings."-J. A. B.] </p>
<p><a name="P1557_888394"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The LXX. have "faith," probably in the sense of "truth," which Aquila has, and the Hebrew requires; "true" is added by St. Chrys. to mark this.</p>
<p><a name="P1559_888894"></a>
<sup>11 </sup><font face="SPIonic">h9liki/a</font>, which carries on the simile. [He means the age of childhood, when ornaments are a pleasure.-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1560_889380"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>He probably refers to the benefits conferred by the Saints on those on earth.</p>
<p><a name="P1561_891189"></a>
<sup>13 </sup>[The same Greek word that above is translated "alms."-J. A. B.]</p>
<p><a name="P1562_891711"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>Such a repetition is common with Chrysostom, sometimes perhaps from his own excitement. Here it seems rather meant to temper the warmth of his eloquence, and fix a sober thought. </p>
