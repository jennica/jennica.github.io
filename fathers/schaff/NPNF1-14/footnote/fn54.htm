<sup>25 </sup>This is an heretical objection, as is expressed by the reading in the editions of Sav. and Ben.</p>

<sup>27 </sup>[i.e. so far as Christ's work for men was concerned, it was universal. He put it in the power of all to believe.-F. G.]</p>

<sup>28 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ga\r</font>, om. S.</p>

<sup>29 </sup>Sav. and Ben. omit the words <font face="SPIonic">sh/meron</font>...<font face="SPIonic">se</font>, and for <font face="SPIonic">e0c ou[ e0stin o9 qeo/j. w#sper ga\r</font> have <font face="SPIonic">e0c au0tou= e0stin : w#sper de</font>;, so that the passage runs; "but this, `thou art My Son,0' expresses nothing else than that He is of Him. And just as," &amp;c... The corrector seems to have misapprehended the meaning of <font face="SPIonic">e0c ou[</font> in this place.</p>
<p><a name="P5417_1764060"></a>
<sup>30 </sup><font face="SPIonic">w@n</font>. </p>
<p><a name="P5421_1767101"></a>
<sup>31 </sup>[St. Chrys. here follows a text having the gloss <font face="SPIonic">ei0kh=</font> now rejected by nearly all critical editors.-F. G.] </p>
<p><a name="P5440_1776643"></a>
<sup>1 </sup><font face="SPIonic">duo\ pro/swpa deiknu\j, kai\ Qeo\n kai\ a@nqrwpon</font>. That is <i>both</i> two distinct Persons in the Godhead, and also the Divine and human natures of the Christ. The corrector would seem to have understood it "two Persons, both God and man"; the common texts read <font face="SPIonic">duo\ to\n au0to\n deiknu\j, k. q. k. a0</font>. "showing the same [Person] to be two, both God and man." [The first <font face="SPIonic">kai</font>; may well be translated <i>both</i>. It seems to have been omitted by the corrector simply as superfluous, not as altering the sense.-F. G.]</p>
<p><a name="P5441_1777165"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Sav. and Ben. omit <font face="SPIonic">'Ioudai/ouj</font>. The teaching of Paul of Samosata was regarded as closely connected with Judaism, and he and his followers were called Jews.</p>
<p><a name="P5442_1777781"></a>
<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kata\ th\n u9po/stasin</font>, see above, pp. 370, 371, notes.</p>
<p><a name="P5444_1778781"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The Ben. editor observes that it had been said that <font face="SPIonic">o9 qeo/j</font> with the article is used in Scripture only of the Father, and that St. Chrys. here as in other places argues that it is used of the Son. </p>
<p><a name="P5461_1790028"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>This last clause seems unconnected as it stands here. If there were ms. authority one should be glad to transfer it a few lines lower, after the management of Angels: <font face="SPIonic">ta\ dia\ tw=n a0gge/lwn oi0konomhqe/nta</font>, or to place here the words "What shall we say," down to "thick darkness."</p>
<p><a name="P5464_1791703"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>See St. Chrys. on the passage, 2 Cor. x. 5 [p. 242, O. T.]. The expression "captivity" was the "'word of evil sound."</p>
<p><a name="P5465_1791894"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Rom. i. 27. </p>
<p><a name="P5468_1793028"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>lit. <i>ferried</i> it over: <font face="SPIonic">diepo/rqmeusen</font>, the word is specially applied to messages between earth and heaven, by Pseudo-Dionys. <i>Areop. de Celesti Hierarchia</i>, c. xv. 6. "The Angels are called Winds, to express their rapid power of making things, how it reaches almost to all things without time; and their motion in the manner of those who ferry over, from above downwards, and again from the lower parts up the steep, both drawing out the things of secondary order towards that loftier height, and moving those of the first order to come forth in the way of sympathy and care for their inferiors."</p>
<p><a name="P5470_1793785"></a>
<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0pisteu/qh</font>. Dunaeus suggested <font face="SPIonic">e0pistw/qh</font>, "it was accredited," but there is no ms. authority for the change.</p>
<p><a name="P5471_1793956"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>St. Chrys. seems to have had in view 2 Cor. i. 21, 22, where "confirming" is connected with the earnest of "the Spirit." [The passage is, "how he which stablishes us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts."-F. G.]</p>
