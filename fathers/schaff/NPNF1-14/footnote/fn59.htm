<sup>1 </sup>The received version is necessarily altered here: St. Chrysostom's commentary will be more readily understood if it is kept in mind that the exact translation would be as below: "the land which hath drunk in," &amp;c., "partaketh of blessing," &amp;c. "But if it bear thorns and thistles, it is reprobate, and nigh unto a curse, whose end is for burning." [There seems to be no need of this slight correction; the present participle of the Greek is even more closely represented by the A. V. than by the above translation. But in view of this note, it must be allowed to stand.-F. G.]</p>

<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a0do/kimoj</font> "reprobate." </p>
<p><a name="P5906_1976354"></a>
<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a0do/kimoj</font>. In the original it is one and the same word which in the text, Heb. vi. 8, is translated "rejected," in 1 Cor. ix. 27, "a castaway"; it is in this clause opposed to <font face="SPIonic">do/kimoj</font>, "approved," "accepted." It means rejected after testing, as in case of metals: which may take place, as St. Chrys. implies in this passage, either here or hereafter; either for a time or for eternity.</p>
<p><a name="P5914_1980236"></a>

<sup>6 </sup>[<font face="SPIonic">tri/bolon</font>, "a burr."] </p>
<p><a name="P5924_1982967"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Sav. and Ben. here, and in other places where the text is cited, insert <font face="SPIonic">tou= ko/pou</font>, "the labor of love," &amp;c. These words are probably not part of the sacred text. They are not referred to by St. Chrysostom.</p>
<p><a name="P5932_1986570"></a>
<sup>8 </sup><font face="SPIonic">nwqroi</font>;. The same word is translated "slothful" and "dull" in these two passages. It means "sluggish," "stupid," "without quickness in perception or energy in action."</p>

<sup>10 </sup><font face="SPIonic">nwqroi</font>;. The same word is translated "slothful" and "dull" in these two passages. It means "sluggish," "stupid," "without quickness in perception or energy in action."</p>

<sup>11 </sup><font face="SPIonic">nwqroi</font>;. The same word is translated "slothful" and "dull" in these two passages. It means "sluggish," "stupid," "without quickness in perception or energy in action."</p>

<sup>14 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0a\n mh9 h\| a!cioj, e0a\n mh\ h\| di/kaioj</font>. Mr. Field retains <font face="SPIonic">mh</font>; in these clauses, in accordance with the common editions, though all the mss. omit the negative in the first clause, and the best mss. in the second also, and it was not read by Mutianus. If it be omitted, the passage would run thus, "and says, If he be worthy, if he be righteous [I will help him]. Unless he work miracles I stretch out no hand," &amp;c.; which seems to give a good sense.</p>
<p><a name="P5948_1992764"></a>
<sup>15 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0lehmosu/nh</font>, "mercifulness." or "almsgiving." </p>

<sup>3 </sup>This observation seems to be suggested by the words "the hope set before us": i.e. this is another instance of obtaining a future blessing by patient waiting. The next clause bears on the Apostle's statement that this oath was made "that we might have consolation," we, "now," at this time; not Abraham, to whom the oath was originally made.</p>
<p><a name="P5975_2003504"></a>
<sup>4 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0peidh</font>;, "at the very time that."</p>
<p><a name="P5978_2004804"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Sav. And Ben. add <font face="SPIonic">h#dh e0tu/xete</font>, "ye have already attained it."</p>

<p><a name="P5985_2007641"></a>
<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">qusi/a</font>, "the act of sacrificing." [<font face="SPIonic">qusi/a</font> commonly has the meaning given in the text, not that in the note.-F. G.]</p>
