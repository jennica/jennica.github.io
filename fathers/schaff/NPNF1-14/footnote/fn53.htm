<sup>4 </sup>That is, the Macedonians or Pneumatomachi, who about the year 373 found great fault with St. Basil for using indifferently the two forms of doxology, sometimes <font face="SPIonic">meta\ tou= Ui9ou= su\n tw=| Pneumati tw=|  9Agi/w|</font>, sometimes <font face="SPIonic">dia\ tou= Ui9ou= e0n tw=| Pneu/mati tw=|  9Agi/w|</font>. They said that the latter, by which they meant to imply inferiority in the Third Person especially, was the only proper form. This gave occasion to St. Basil's writing his Tract <i>De Spiritu Sancto</i>, in which he refutes them at large, proving among other things that <font face="SPIonic">e0n</font> is in Scripture often equivalent to <font face="SPIonic">su/n</font>. c. 25 t. iii. 49. That <font face="SPIonic">e0n</font> is put for <font face="SPIonic">dia</font>; is also said by St. Chrys. Hom. on 1 Cor. i. 4 (p. 13, O. T.) and elsewhere.</p>

<sup>9 </sup>That is for the moment St. Paul, does not argue the dignity of Christ from the title "Son"-from His being the <i>true</i> Son of God, and therefore God, but condescending to the weakness of his hearers, at first uses the word in a general sense, and establishes His Divinity by other considerations.</p>

<sup>11 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kata\ pneu=ma</font> is the reading adopted by Mr. Field, following herein an ancient Catena [compiled by Niketas Archbishop of Heraclea in Thrace who flourished in the 11th century] which has preserved it: <font face="SPIonic">kata\ to=n pate/ra</font> is found in all other mss. and Editions, and was probably the reading in Mutianus' text, who translates "essentiae paternae." Of the use of <font face="SPIonic">pneu=ma</font> for the Divine Nature of the Son, see many instances brought together in the note to the Oxford Translation of St. Athanasius against the Arians, p. 196 d. [See also in Tertullian, O. T. note H. pp. 322 sqq.]</p>

<sup>13 </sup>That is the Name Son. The passage is thus rightly pointed by Mr. Field in accordance with the addition of the explanatory word "Son" in [Niketas'] Catena (Supp.). According to the pointing of the other editions, the translation would be, "For this Name, God the Word, He ever had."</p>

<sup>11 </sup>Marcellus Bishop of Ancyra lapsed towards Sabellianism, holding, as it seems, virtually at least, that our Lord is not a Person eternally distinct from the Father, but, a Manifestation of the Father, lasting from the Incarnation to the Judgment. His views are anathematized in 1 Conc. Constantinop. Canon 1.</p>

<sup>13 </sup><font face="SPIonic">u9posta/sewj</font>. St. Chrys. understands the word to mean here neither "substance" nor "Person," but, if we may use such a word, "substantiality," or "substantive existence," which in speaking <i>de Divinis</i> we call "Personality." See below, page 371, note 5.</p>

<sup>16 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a@narxon</font>. On this third heresy respecting the Holy Trinity, see St. Greg. Naz. <i>Orat</i>. ii. 37; xx. 6; in both which places it is, as here, mentioned as the third form of error with Sabellianism and Arianism. See also Bp. Bull, <i>Def. Fid. N.</i> iv. 1. 8. The mention of this is not found in the Common text, in which the whole passage is recast.</p>

Mr. Field says that the old translation of Mutianus in some degree confirms this latter reading, which is easier. The word <font face="SPIonic">u9po/stasin</font> in the singular is used in the sense of "Personality," as above, p. 370, note 12. </p>
