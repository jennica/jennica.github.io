<sup>33 </sup>Here and again below the Catena and Mutianus read "eternal," and so one ms. <i>a priori manu</i>. [The reading <font face="SPIonic">ai0wniou</font> of the <i>Textus Receptus</i> is far better supported, and is retained by all critical editors. It is also the reading of one of Field's mss., although with <font face="SPIonic">a9gi/ou</font> written above it.-F. G.] </p>

<sup>36 </sup><font face="SPIonic">monoma/xoj</font>. The reading of the common editions is [<font face="SPIonic">ka@n dou=loj h\|</font>] <font face="SPIonic">ka@n e@leu/qeroj, ka@n mo/naxoj</font>. The word <font face="SPIonic">mo/naxoj</font> had been at a very early period written by some copyists for <font face="SPIonic">monoma/xoj</font> (Mutianus has <i>monachus</i>), and the interpolator misapprehending the drift of the passage had inserted <font face="SPIonic">ka@n e0leu/qeroj</font>. Mr. Field many years ago in earlier volumes of his edition, suggested the true reading here, as also the word <font face="SPIonic">qhrioma/xoij</font> (<i>bestialibus</i> Mut.) just below, for which <font face="SPIonic">qeoma/xoij</font> had been substituted in the common texts. Both conjectures are now confirmed by ms. authority. The gladiators, especially the <i>bestiarii</i>, who fought with wild beasts, were regarded as a most degraded class.</p>

<sup>4 </sup>"inaugurated." [<font face="SPIonic">e0gkekai/nistai</font>. It cannot be denied that the word in the classics bears both the closely related meanings of <i>inaugurate</i> and <i>consecrate</i>. The English editor has adopted the former throughout this homily; but as the common meaning in the LXX. is <i>consecrate</i>, and as the common name of the festival of the dedication of the restored temple was <font face="SPIonic">e0gkai/nia</font>, it seems better to keep to the word adopted both by the A. V. and the Revision.-F. G.]</p>

<p><a name="P6345_2136490"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>This is not a citation of any words of our Lord: but probably John xv. 27. which is substantially equivalent, was the passage intended; the words are those of 1 Tim. v. 21 [I charge thee before God, <font face="SPIonic">Diamartu/romai e0nw/pion tou= Qeou=</font>] thrown into the imperative form.</p>

<p><a name="P6350_2138128"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Mr. Field points the passage thus: "we could never have been saved; if our Lord had not died for us, the Law would not have had power," &amp;c. The translation follows the Bened. pointing, as giving the meaning most in accordance with St. Chrys.'s teaching. [This pointing of the English edition is allowed to stand as making the sense more obvious to the English reader; but Mr. Field's pointing gives essentially the same sense and is more in St. Chrysostom's style.-F. G.] </p>

<sup>10 </sup><font face="SPIonic">krathtiko/n</font>. The common text, besides other additions, adds the explanatory words <font face="SPIonic">tou= ai#matoj</font> "of the blood."</p>
<p><a name="P6356_2140221"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>The common editions add <font face="SPIonic">o@n</font>, determining the meaning to be "he [or it] shows that blood and water are the same thing."</p>

<p><a name="P6360_2140885"></a>
<sup>14 </sup>Or as the position of <font face="SPIonic">fhsi</font>; after <font face="SPIonic">ai[ma</font> would seem to imply was the interpretation of St. Chrys.: "This blood is that of the New Testament," &amp;c.</p>

<p><a name="P6368_2143367"></a>
<sup>17 </sup>The Greek is <font face="SPIonic">ta\ h9me/tera</font>, including all our sacraments, services, relations, life and conversation. See Hom. xiv. [3]. [S. Chrys. there describes the heavenly things as "spiritual," and here, in accordance with the whole context, he must refer more to the spiritual than to the outward and ceremonial side of our religion.-F. G.]</p>
<p><a name="P6369_2144076"></a>
<sup>18 </sup>[There is a paronomasia here which is difficult of expression in English; lit. "our citizenship is in heaven, yet we live as citizens here."-F. G.]</p>
<p><a name="P6371_2144426"></a>
<sup>19 </sup>[This passage is obscure; but the meaning seems to be, "This teaching, given above, is the philosophy of those Christians who are called to such studies."-F. G.] </p>
<p><a name="P6374_2144939"></a>
<sup>20 </sup><font face="SPIonic">qusi/aj</font>. Mr. Field adopts the reading of the later mss. (and common editions) <font face="SPIonic">ou0si/aj</font>, "substance," or "possession." But the three mss. which he usually follows and the old translation read <font face="SPIonic">qusi/aj</font>, which has been followed in the translation. [There are, however, as many mss. on the other side, and whether <font face="SPIonic">ou0si/aj</font> be translated "possession" or "reality," it would give an excellent sense and one well in accordance with the context.-F. G.]</p>

<p><a name="P6398_2153297"></a>
<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a#pac</font>, "once for all." [The English editor seems to have regarded <font face="SPIonic">a#pac</font> as the equivalent for the more emphatic <font face="SPIonic">e0fa/pac</font> of vii. 27, ix. 12, x. 10, both here and throughout this Homily. It seems better to retain the distinction of the Greek words.-F. G.]</p>
