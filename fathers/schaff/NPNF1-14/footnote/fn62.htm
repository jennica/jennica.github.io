<sup>17 </sup>That is, besides the covenant being in itself a new one, different from the Mosaic, there is also, he says, the difference in the mode of giving it, the one being written, the other put into the heart. The Jew is supposed to allege that this second is the only difference, and that the promise in the Prophecy is that the Mosaic law shall be given into the heart, and that this was fulfilled by the reformation of the people: as for instance after the Captivity.</p>

<sup>20 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'Idou\, fhsi\, kai\ au#th kainh\ tugxa/nei</font>. This is the argument of an objector, who alleges that the promise of a New Covenant was fulfilled by the modification and renewed efficacy of the Mosaic system, such as occurred after the Captivity. He alleges two senses in which the word "New" might be applied without implying the substitution of another system in place of the old, (i) as a repaired house is said to be new, and (ii) according to his interpretation, as the Heavens are new, when after long drought they again give rain. St. Chrys. replies. i. That after the Captivity the Covenant was still, as of old, unfruitful. ii. That this interpretation of the "new heaven" is incorrect. iii. That the Prophecy distinctly foretells a substitution. The common editions have changed the character of the passage by substituting <font face="SPIonic">a@llwj de\ kainh</font>; for <font face="SPIonic">kainh</font>; two lines above, and <font face="SPIonic">kainh\ de\ kai\ au#th t</font>. for <font face="SPIonic">'Idou</font>;...<font face="SPIonic">kainh\ t</font>. in this place; by omitting <font face="SPIonic">fhsi</font>; at the end of the objection; and substituting <font face="SPIonic">i#na deich=|</font> for <font face="SPIonic">e0a\n ou\n dei/cw</font>.</p>

<sup>22 </sup>The Verona edition, one Catena, the mss. which Mr. Field usually follows, and the Latin versions of Mutianus and the later translator, all give the text which is here translated: <font face="SPIonic">o#tan mhke/ti xalkou=j h\|, a0ll' u9eto\n didw=| : o#tan mh\ a@karpoj, ou0x o/tan metablhqh=|, ou0x o#tan ta\ me\n au0tou= e0caireqh=|, ta\ de\ me/nh</font>. Mr. Field says that he has <i>nolens volens</i> admitted into the text the "amended" readings of the common editions, <font face="SPIonic">o#tan mhke/ti x. h\. a0. u9. didw=|, 0kai\ h9 gh= o9moiwj kainh9, o#tan mh\ a0. h\|, ou0x o#tan metablhqh|=, kai\ oi\koj oi/ tw kaino\j o#tan ta\ me\n k. l</font>.. "when it is no longer at brass, but gives rain: [and the earth in like manner is new,] when it is not unfruitful, not when it has been changed: [and in this sense the house is new], when portions of it have been," &amp;c. There does not however appear to be any need for this: on the contrary, while the old text is simple and intelligible, the additions bring in matters which are out of place. [The other Catena, however, that of Niketas, Archbishop of Heraklea, one of Mr. Field's valuable authorities, has the bracketed bits.]</p>
<p>The words <font face="SPIonic">o#tan mh\ a@karpoj</font> apply naturally to the heaven, when it does not supply the moisture necessary for producing fruit. This argument from the "new heaven" is alleged by the objector as distinct from that of the "new house": it is an instance, he would say, of the word "new" being applied, when there was neither change nor substitution, as St. Chrys. interprets the prophecy: nor even partial alteration as in the analogy of the "new house"; but only a renewal of fertilizing action which had been previously suspended.</p>
<p>On the other hand the introduction of "the new earth" by the interpolator is out of place: inasmuch as unfruitful ground would represent the people not the Law; neither does St. Chrys. in the refutation which follows refer at all to this point of "new earth." The introduction of the "house" is simply needless repetition. [It has seemed better to follow in the translation Field's text than to follow the alterations of the English edition-both because the passage is thus much clearer, and because this is professedly a translation of Field's text, and his critical sagacity must be considered on such a point of higher value.-F. G.] </p>

<sup>25 </sup><font face="SPIonic">pw=j ou0n e!laben au0to/n</font>; The Catena has <font face="SPIonic">pw=j sune/labon au0to/n</font>; which Mutianus read, translating it, "Quomodo corripuerunt eum?" Mr. Field thinks that neither reading gives a suitable meaning. If the reading adopted by Mr. F. and followed in the translation be the true one, it must be supposed that St. Chrys. had in mind the condition in which Ezra, or perhaps Nehemiah, found the Jews. The words <font face="SPIonic">ti/ de0 @Esdraj e0gkalei=</font>; seem more appropriate to Nehemiah than to Ezra: and the reception of Nehemiah on his second visit to Jerusalem may have been the circumstance of which the orator was thinking.</p>

<sup>6 </sup>This passage is translated [in the English edition] as if there was a point between <font face="SPIonic">th\n sa/rka</font> and <font face="SPIonic">ei0serxome/nhn</font>: and as if in the next clause <font face="SPIonic">toute/sti</font> was a part of the citation, being put by St. Chrys. before the words <font face="SPIonic">dia\ tou= katapeta/smatoj</font>, instead of after them, as in Heb. x. 20. St. Chrys. says that "the veil" represents both Heaven and "the Flesh" of our Lord; and cites the two places where it is so interpreted by the Apostle, vi. 19, x. 20. See below [4], p. 440. [The simple translation of the Greek (as given in the text) seems far better than this curious modification. The clause <font face="SPIonic">th\n sa/rka ei0serxome/nhn ei0j to\ e0sw/t. t. katapet</font>. is closely connected together, and it is hardly tolerable to separate <font face="SPIonic">sa/rka</font> from the participle agreeing with it. There is no "which" in the Greek.-F. G.]</p>
<p><a name="P6254_2109046"></a>
<sup>7 </sup><font face="SPIonic">to/te</font>. Mr. Field seems to think that the Expositor read <font face="SPIonic">to/te</font> in the sacred text: though, as he observes, he presently has <font face="SPIonic">to/ te</font>. Perhaps the difficulty is avoided by supposing that the word <font face="SPIonic">ei\xe</font>, "had," with which the clause begins, was emphasized in delivery, the explanation of the word "ordinances" being parenthetical, and the <font face="SPIonic">to/te</font> being implied in the past tense <font face="SPIonic">ei\xe</font>.</p>

<p><a name="P6290_2117428"></a>
<sup>26 </sup>A slight alteration of Mr. Field's text seems needed here. The text of the Homily which he gives in accordance with all the authorities is: <font face="SPIonic">o9ra=|j pw=j kai\ skhnh\n kai\ katape/tasma kai\ ou0rano\n to\ sw=ma kalei=</font>. But there is no appearance that the Apostle called Christ's body heaven, nor do any of the texts cited show it. If however, we introduce <font face="SPIonic">kai</font>; before <font face="SPIonic">to\ sw=ma</font>, or substitute it for <font face="SPIonic">to</font>;, we have a good sense, in accordance with the four texts cited by St Chrys. and the explanations which he afterwards gives. [The criticism of the English editor is not without some force; yet it seems best to adhere to the text of St. Chrys., as is here done. The proposed alteration does not remove the difficulty, which is merely negative. The rendering in the English edition is "he calls heaven and the body both tabernacle and veil." But <font face="SPIonic">to\ sw=ma</font> should be the subject and <font face="SPIonic">skhnh\n kai\ katape/tasma kai\ ou0rano/n</font> predicates.-F. G.]</p>
<p><a name="P6291_2118551"></a>
<sup>27 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ei0serxome/nhn</font>; probably used by St. Chrys. as if <font face="SPIonic">th\n sa/rka</font> had preceded.</p>
<p><a name="P6292_2118913"></a>
<sup>28 </sup>The pointing has been changed in this place. In Mr. Field's edition the passage stands thus: <font face="SPIonic">katape/tasma o9 ou0ranoj : w#sper ga\r a0poteixi/zei ta\ a#gia katape/tasma, h9 sa\rc kru/ptousa th\n qeo/thta</font>. The translation is made as if the pointing was <font face="SPIonic">ta\ a#gia : katape/tasma h9 sa\rc, kru/ptousa th\n q</font>. Otherwise we must supply <font face="SPIonic">h9 sa\rc</font> before <font face="SPIonic">w#sper</font>. [The pointing is better as it stands; at most, it is only necessary to understand <font face="SPIonic">katape/tasma</font> <i>after</i> <font face="SPIonic">sa\rc</font>, which the contrast plainly suggests.-F. G.]</p>
