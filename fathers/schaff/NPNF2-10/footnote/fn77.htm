<sup>1 </sup>"When Valentinian was journeying from Constantinople to Rome ...some bishops despatched Hypatian ...to request permission to assemble themselves together for deliberation on questions of doctrine. ...Valentinian made the following reply: 'I am but one of the laity, and have therefore no right to interfere in these transactions; let the priests, to whom such matters appertain, assemble where they please."

<sup>2 </sup>Allusion is here made to a celebrated act of Valentinian, when attending on the Emperor Julian at the temple of Fortune.

Eccl.</i> VI. 6.</p>
