<p><i>Description of the town of Thennesus.</i></p>
</ul><p>When We were living in a monastery in Syria after our first infancy in the faith, and when after we had grown somewhat we had begun to long for some greater grace of perfection, we determined straightway to seek Egypt and penetrating even to the remotest desert of the Thebaid,<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5112_1850531" id="P5112_1850531" name="P5112_1850531">1</a></sup> to visit very many of the saints, whose glory and fame had spread abroad everywhere, with the wish if not to emulate them at any rate to know them. And so we came by a very lengthy voyage to a town of Egypt named Thennesus,<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5113_1851010" id="P5113_1851010" name="P5113_1851010">2</a></sup> whose inhabitants are so surrounded either by the sea or by salt lakes that they devote themselves to business alone and get their wealth and substance by naval commerce as the land fails them, so that indeed when they want to build houses, there is no soil sufficient for this, unless it is brought by boat from a distance.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5115_1851489"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter II.</font></p>
<p><i>Of Bishop Archebius.</i></p>
</ul><p>And when we arrived there, God gratified our wishes, and had brought about the arrival of that most blessed and excellent man Bishop Archebius,<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5118_1851664" id="P5118_1851664" name="P5118_1851664">3</a></sup> who had been carried off from the assembly of anchorites and given as Bishop to the town of Panephysis,<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5119_1852031" id="P5119_1852031" name="P5119_1852031">4</a></sup> and who kept all his life long to his purpose of solitude with such strictness that he relaxed nothing of the character of his former humility, nor flattered himself on the honour that had been added to him (for he vowed that he had not been summoned to that office as fit for it, but complained that he had been expelled from the monastic system as unworthy of it because though he had spent thirty-seven years in it he had never been able to arrive at the purity so high a profession demands); he then when he had received us kindly and most graciously in the aforesaid Thennesus whither the business of electing a Bishop there had brought him, as soon as he heard of our wish and desire to inquire of the holy fathers even in still more remote parts of Egypt: "Come," said he, "see in the meanwhile the old men who live not far from our monastery, the length of whose service is shown by their bent bodies, as their holiness shines forth in their appearance, so that even the mere sight of them will give a great lesson to those who see them: and from them you can learn not so much by their words as by the actual example of their holy life, what I grieve that I have lost, and having lost cannot give to you. But I think that my poverty will be somewhat lessened by this zeal of mine, if when you are seeking that pearl of the Gospel which I have not, I at least provide where you can conveniently procure it.' </p>

<font size="3">Chapter III.</font></p>
<p><i>Description of the desert where Chaeremon, Nesteros, and Joseph lived.</i></p>
</ul><p>And so he took his staff and scrip, as is there the custom for all monks starting on a journey, and himself led us as guide of our road to his own city, i.e., Panephysis, the lands of which and indeed the greater part of the neighbouring region (formerly an extremely rich one since from it, as report says, everything was supplied for the royal table), had been covered by the sea which was disturbed by a sudden earthquake and overflowed its banks, and so (almost all the villages being in ruins) covered what were formerly rich lands with salt marshes, so that you might think that what is spiritually sung in the psalm was a literal prophecy of that region. "He hath turned rivers into a wilderness; and the Springs of waters into a thirsty land: a fruitful land into saltness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5124_1854444" id="P5124_1854444" name="P5124_1854444">5</a></sup> In these districts then many towns perched in this way on the higher hills were deserted by their inhabitants and turned by the inundation into islands, and these afforded the desired solitude to the holy anchorites, among whom three old men; viz., Chaeremon, Nesteros and Joseph, stood out as anchorites of the longest standing.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5126_1854800"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter IV.</font></p>
<p><i>Of Abbot Chaeremon and his excuse about the teaching which we asked for.</i></p>
</ul><p>And so the blessed Archebius thought it best to take us first to Chaeremon,<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5129_1854959" id="P5129_1854959" name="P5129_1854959">6</a></sup> because he was nearer to his monastery, and because he was more advanced than the other two in age: for he had passed the hundredth year of his life, vigorous only in spirit, but with his back bowed with age and constant prayer, so that, as if he were once more in his childhood he crawled with his hands hanging down and resting on the ground. Gazing then at one and the same time on this man's wonderful face and on his walk (for though all his limbs had already failed and were dead yet he had lost none of the severity of his previous strictness) when we humbly asked for the word and doctrine, and declared that longing for spiritual instruction was the only reason for our coming, he sighed deeply and said: What doctrine can I teach you, I in whom the feebleness of age has relaxed my former strictness, as it has also destroyed my confidence in speaking? For how could I presume to teach what I do not do, or instruct another in what I know I now practise but feebly and coldly? Wherefore I do not allow any of the younger men to live with me now that I am of such an advanced age, lest the other's strictness should be relaxed owing to my example. For the authority of a teacher will never be strong unless he fixes it in the heart of his hearer by the actual performance of his duty.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5131_1856371"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter V.</font></p>
<p><i>Of our answer to his excuse.</i></p>
</ul><p>AT this we were overwhelmed with no slight confusion and replied as follows: Although both the difficulty of the place and the solitary life itself, which even a robust youth could scarcely put up with, ought to be sufficient to teach us everything (and indeed without your saying anything they <i>do</i> teach and impress us a very great deal) yet still we ask you to lay aside your silence for a little and in a more worthy manner implant in us those principles by which we may be able to embrace, not so much by imitating it as by admiring it, that goodness which we see in you. For even if our coldness is known to you, and does not deserve to obtain what we are asking for, yet at least the trouble of so long a journey ought to be repaid by it, as we made haste to come here after our first beginning in the monastery of Bethlehem, owing to a longing for your instruction, and a yearning for our own good.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5135_1857313"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter VI.</font></p>
<p><i> Abbot Chaeremon's statement that faults can be overcome in three ways.</i></p>
</ul><p>Then the blessed Chaeremon: There are, said he, three things which enable men to control their faults; viz., either the fear of hell or of laws even now imposed; or the hope and desire of the kingdom of heaven; or a liking for goodness itself and the love of virtue. For then we read that the fear of evil loathes contamination: "The fear of the Lord hateth evil."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5138_1857760" id="P5138_1857760" name="P5138_1857760">7</a></sup> Hope also shuts out the assaults of all faults: for "all who hope in Him shall not fail."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5139_1857869" id="P5139_1857869" name="P5139_1857869">8</a></sup> Love also fears no destruction from sins, for "love never faileth;"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5140_1857965" id="P5140_1857965" name="P5140_1857965">9</a></sup> and again: "love covers a multitude of sins."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5141_1858031" id="P5141_1858031" name="P5141_1858031">10</a></sup> And therefore the blessed Apostle confines the whole sum of salvation in the attainment of those three virtues, saying "Now abideth faith, hope, love, these three."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5142_1858216" id="P5142_1858216" name="P5142_1858216">11</a></sup> For faith is what makes us shun the stains of sin from fear of future judgment and punishment; hope is what withdraws our mind from present things, and despises all bodily pleasures from its expectation of heavenly rewards; love is what inflames us with keenness of heart for the love of Christ and the fruit of spiritual goodness, and makes us hate with a perfect hatred whatever is opposed to these. And these three things although they all seem to aim at one and the same end (for they incite us to abstain from things unlawful) yet they differ from each other greatly in the degrees of their excellence. For the two former belong properly to those men who in their aim at goodness have not yet acquired the love of virtue, and the third belongs specially to God and to those who have received into themselves the image and likeness of God. For He alone does the things that are good, with no fear and no thanks or reward to stir Him up, but simply from the love of goodness. For, as Solomon says, "The Lord hath made all things for Himself."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5143_1859284" id="P5143_1859284" name="P5143_1859284">12</a></sup> For under cover of His own goodness He bestows all the fulness of good things on the worthy and the unworthy because He cannot be wearied by wrongs, nor be moved by passions at the sins of men, as He ever remains perfect goodness and unchangeable in His nature.</p>

<p><i> By what steps we can ascend to the heights of love and what</i></p>
</ul><p> permanence there is in it.</p>
<p>IF then any one is aiming at perfection, from that first Stage of fear which we rightly termed servile (of which it is said: "When ye have done all things say: we are unprofitable servants,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5149_1859854" id="P5149_1859854" name="P5149_1859854">13</a></sup> ) he should by advancing a step mount to the higher path of hope-which is compared not to a slave but to a hireling, because it looks for the payment of its recompense, and as if it were free from care concerning absolution of its sins and fear of punishment, and conscious of its own good works, though it seems to look for the promised reward, yet it cannot attain to that love of a son who, trusting in his father's kindness and liberality, has no doubt that all that the father has is his, to which also that prodigal who together with his father's substance had lost the very name of son, did not venture to aspire, when he said: "I am no more worthy to be called thy son;" for after those husks which the swine ate, satisfaction from which was denied to him, i.e., the disgusting food of sin, as he "came to himself," and was overcome by a salutary fear, he already began to loathe the uncleanness of the swine, and to dread the punishment of gnawing hunger, and as if he had already been made a servant, desires the condition of a hireling and thinks about the remuneration, and says: "How many hired servants of my father have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger. I will then return to my father and will say unto him, `Father I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.'"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5150_1861256" id="P5150_1861256" name="P5150_1861256">14</a></sup> But those words of humble penitence his father who ran to meet him received with greater affection than that with which they were spoken, and was not content to allow him lesser things, but passing through the two stages without delay restored him to his former dignity of sonship. We also ought forthwith to hasten on that by means of the indissoluble grace of love we may mount to that third stage of sonship, which believes that all that the father has is its own, and so we may be counted worthy to receive the image and likeness of our heavenly Father, and be able to say after the likeness of the true son: "All that the Father hath is mine."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5151_1861929" id="P5151_1861929" name="P5151_1861929">15</a></sup> Which also the blessed Apostle declares of us, saying: "All things are yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5152_1862151" id="P5152_1862151" name="P5152_1862151">16</a></sup> And to this likeness the commands of our Saviour also summon us: "Be ye," says He, "perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5153_1862307" id="P5153_1862307" name="P5153_1862307">17</a></sup> For in these persons sometimes the love of goodness is found to be interrupted, when the vigour of the soul is relaxed by some coldness or joy or delight, and so loses either the fear of hell for the time, or the desire of future blessings. And there is indeed in these a stage leading to some advance, which affects us so that when from fear of punishment or from hope of reward we begin to avoid sin we are enabled to pass on to the stage of love, for "fear," says one, "is not in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment, but he who fears is not perfect in love. We therefore love because God first loved us."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5154_1862964" id="P5154_1862964" name="P5154_1862964">18</a></sup> We can then only ascend to that true perfection when, as He first loved us for the grace of nothing but our salvation, we also have loved Him for the sake of nothing but His own love alone. Wherefore we must do our best to mount with perfect ardour of mind from this fear to hope, from hope to the love of God, and the love of the virtues themselves, that as we steadily pass on to the love of goodness itself, we may, as far as it is possible for human nature, keep firm hold of what is good.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5156_1863481"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter VIII.</font></p>
<p><i>How greatly those excel who depart from sin through the feeling of love.</i></p>
</ul><p>For there is a great difference between one who puts out the fire of sin within him by fear of hell or hope of future reward, and one who from the feeling of divine love has a horror of sin itself and of uncleanness, and keeps hold of the virtue of purity simply from the love and longing for purity, and looks for no reward from a promise for the future, but, delighted with the knowledge of good things present, does everything not from regard to punishment but from delight in virtue. For this condition can neither abuse an opportunity to sin when all human witnesses are absent, nor be corrupted by the secret allurements of thoughts, while, keeping in its very marrow the love of virtue itself, it not only does not admit into the heart anything that is opposed to it, but actually hates it with the utmost horror. For it is one thing for a man in his delight at some present good to hate the stains of sins and of the flesh, and another thing to check unlawful desires by contemplating the future reward; and it is one thing to fear present loss and another to dread future punishment. Lastly it is a much greater thing to be unwilling to forsake good for good's own sake, than it is to withhold consent from evil for fear of evil. For in the former case the good is voluntary, but in the latter it is constrained and as it were violently forced out of a reluctant party either by fear of punishment or by greed of reward. For one who abstains from the allurements of sin owing to fear, will whenever the obstacle of fear is removed, once more return to what he loves and thus will not continually acquire any stability in good, nor will he ever rest free from attacks because he will not secure the sure and lasting peace of chastity. For where there is the disturbance of warfare there cannot help being the danger of wounds. For one who is in the midst of the conflict, even though he is a warrior and by fighting bravely inflicts frequent and deadly wounds on his foes, must still sometimes be pierced by the point of the enemy's sword. But one who has defeated the attack of sins and is now in the enjoyment of the security of peace, and has passed on to the love of virtue itself, will keep this condition of good continually, as he is entirely wrapped up in it, because he believes that nothing can be worse than the loss of his inmost chastity. For he deems nothing dearer or more precious than present purity, to whom a dangerous departure from virtue or a poisonous stain of sin is a grievous punishment. To such an one, I say, neither will regard for the presence of another add anything to his goodness nor will solitude take anything away from it: but as always and everywhere he bears about with him his conscience as a judge not only of his actions but also of his thoughts, he will especially try to please it, as he knows that it cannot be cheated nor deceived, and that he cannot escape it.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5160_1866481"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter IX.</font></p>
<p><i>That love not only makes sons out of servants, but also bestows the image and likeness of God.</i></p>
</ul><p>And if to anyone relying on the help of God and not on his own efforts, it has been vouch-safed to acquire this state, from the condition of a Servant, wherein is fear, and from a mercenary greed of hope, whereby there is sought not so much the good of the donor as the recompense of reward, he will begin to pass on to the adoption of sons, where there is no longer fear, nor greed, but that love which never faileth continually endures. Of which fear and love the Lord in chiding some shows what is befitting for each one: "A son knoweth his own father, and a servant feareth his lord: And if I be a Father, where is My honour: and if I be a Lord, where is my fear?"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5163_1867256" id="P5163_1867256" name="P5163_1867256">19</a></sup> For one who is a servant must needs fear because "if knowing his lord's will he has done things worthy of stripes, he shall be beaten with many stripes."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5164_1867426" id="P5164_1867426" name="P5164_1867426">20</a></sup> Whoever then by this love has attained the image and likeness of God, will now delight in goodness for the pleasure of goodness itself, and having somehow a like feeling of patience and gentleness will henceforth be angered by no faults of sinners, but in his compassion and sympathy will rather ask for pardon for their infirmities, and, remembering that for so long he himself was tried by the stings of similar passions till by the Lord's mercy he was saved, will feel that, as he was saved from carnal attacks not by the teaching of his own exertions but by God's protection, not anger but pity ought to be shown to those who go astray; and with full peace of mind will he sing to God the following verse: "Thou hast broken my chains. I will offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise;" and: "except the Lord had helped me, my soul had almost dwelt in hell."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5165_1868307" id="P5165_1868307" name="P5165_1868307">21</a></sup> And while he continues in this humility of mind he will be able even to fulfil this Evangelic command of perfection: "Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you and slander you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5166_1868584" id="P5166_1868584" name="P5166_1868584">22</a></sup> And so it will be vouchsafed to us to attain that reward which is subjoined, whereby we shall not only bear the image and likeness of God, but shall even be called sons: "that ye may be," says He "sons of your Father which is in heaven, Who maketh His sun to rise on the good and evil, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust:"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5167_1868938" id="P5167_1868938" name="P5167_1868938">23</a></sup> and this feeling the blessed John knew that he had attained when he said: "that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because as He is so are we also in this world."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5168_1869126" id="P5168_1869126" name="P5168_1869126">24</a></sup> For in what can a weak and fragile human nature be like Him, except in always showing a calm love in its heart towards the good and evil, the just and the unjust, in imitation of God, and by doing good for the love of goodness itself, arriving at that true adoption of the sons of God, of which also the blessed Apostle speaks as follows: "Every one that is born of God doeth not sin, for His seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God;" and again: "We know that every one who is born of God sinneth not, but his birth of God preserves him, and the wicked one toucheth him not?"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5169_1869743" id="P5169_1869743" name="P5169_1869743">25</a></sup> And this must be understood not of all kinds of sins, but only of mortal sins: and if any one will not extricate and cleanse himself from these, for him the aforesaid Apostle tells us in another place that we ought not even to pray, saying: "If a man knows his brother to be sinning a sin not unto death, let him ask, and He will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he should ask for it."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5170_1870216" id="P5170_1870216" name="P5170_1870216">26</a></sup> But of those which he says are not unto death, from which even those who serve Christ faithfully cannot, with whatever care they keep themselves, be free, of these he says: "If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us;" and again: "If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5171_1870583" id="P5171_1870583" name="P5171_1870583">27</a></sup> For it is an impossibility for any one of the saints not to fall into those trivial faults which are committed by word, and thought, and ignorance, and forgetfulness, and necessity, and will, and surprise: which though quite different from that sin which is said to be unto death, still cannot be free from fault and blame.</p>

<p><i>How it is the perfection of love to pray for one's enemies and by what signs we may recognize a mind that is not yet purified.</i></p>
</ul><p>When then any one has acquired this love of goodness of which we have been speaking, and the imitation of God, then he will be endowed with the Lord's heart of compassion, and will pray also for his persecutors, saying in like manner: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5176_1871355" id="P5176_1871355" name="P5176_1871355">28</a></sup> But it is a clear sign of a soul that is not yet thoroughly purged from the dregs of sin, not to sorrow with a feeling of pity at the offences of others, but to keep to the rigid censure of the judge: for how will he be able to obtain perfection of heart, who is without that by which, as the Apostle has pointed out, the full requirements of the law can be fulfilled, saying: "Bear one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5177_1871818" id="P5177_1871818" name="P5177_1871818">29</a></sup> and who has not that virtue of love, which "is not grieved, is not puffed up, thinketh no evil," which "endureth all things, beareth all things."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5178_1871981" id="P5178_1871981" name="P5178_1871981">30</a></sup> For "a righteous man pitieth the life of his beasts: but the heart of the ungodly is without pity."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5179_1872104" id="P5179_1872104" name="P5179_1872104">31</a></sup> And so a monk is quite certain to fall into the same sins which he condemns in another with merciless and inhuman severity, for "a stern king will fall into misfortunes," and "one who stops his ears so as not to hear the weak, shall himself cry, and there shall be none to hear him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5180_1872415" id="P5180_1872415" name="P5180_1872415">32</a></sup> </p>

<p><i> A question why he has called the feeling of fear and hope</i></p>
</ul><p> imperfect.</p>
<p>Germanus: You have indeed spoken powerfully and grandly of the perfect love of God. But still this fact disturbs us; viz., that while you were exalting it with such praise, you said that the fear of God and the hope of eternal reward were imperfect, though the prophet seems to have thought quite differently about them, where he said: "Fear the Lord, all ye His saints, for they that fear Him lack nothing."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5186_1872934" id="P5186_1872934" name="P5186_1872934">33</a></sup> And again in the matter of observing God's righteous acts he admits that he has done them from consideration of the reward, saying: "I have inclined my heart to do thy righteous acts forever, for the reward."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5187_1873173" id="P5187_1873173" name="P5187_1873173">34</a></sup> And the Apostle says: "By faith Moses when he was grown up, denied himself to be the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to be afflicted with the people of God than to have the pleasure of sin for a season, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the Egyptians; for he looked unto the reward."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5188_1873534" id="P5188_1873534" name="P5188_1873534">35</a></sup> How then can we think that they are imperfect, if the blessed David boasted that he did the righteous acts of God in hope of a recompense, and the giver of the Law is said to have looked for a future reward and so to have despised the adoption to royal dignity, and to have preferred the most terrible affliction to the treasures of the Egyptians?</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XII.</font></p>
<p><i>The answer on the different kinds of perfection.</i></p>
</ul><p>Chaeremon: In accordance with the condition and measure of every mind Holy Scripture summons our free wills to different grades of perfection. For no uniform crown of perfection can be offered to all men, because all have not the same virtue, or purpose, or fervour, and so the Divine Word has in some way appointed different ranks and different measures of perfection itself. And that this is so the variety of beatitudes in the gospel clearly shows. For though they are called blessed, whose is the kingdom of heaven, and blessed are they who shall possess the earth, and blessed are they who shall receive their consolation, and blessed are they who shall be filled, yet we believe that there is a great difference between the habitations of the kingdom of heaven, and the possession of the earth, whatever it be, and also between the reception of consolation and the fulness and satisfaction of righteousness; and that there is a great distinction between those who shall obtain mercy, and those who shall be deemed worthy to enjoy the most glorious vision of God. "For there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for star differeth from star in glory, so also is the resurrection of the dead."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5193_1875211" id="P5193_1875211" name="P5193_1875211">36</a></sup> While therefore in accordance with this rule holy Scripture praises those who fear God, and says "Blessed are all they that fear the Lord,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5194_1875375" id="P5194_1875375" name="P5194_1875375">37</a></sup> and promises them for this a full measure of bliss, yet it says again: "There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath torment. But he that feareth is not yet perfect in love."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5195_1875611" id="P5195_1875611" name="P5195_1875611">38</a></sup> And again, though it is a grand thing to serve God, and it is said: "Serve the Lord in fear;" and: "It is a great thing for thee to be called My servant;" and: "Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh, shall find so doing,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5196_1875869" id="P5196_1875869" name="P5196_1875869">39</a></sup> yet it is said to the Apostles: "I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I call you friends, for all things whatsoever I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5197_1876139" id="P5197_1876139" name="P5197_1876139">40</a></sup> And once more: "Ye are My friends, if ye do whatever I command you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5198_1876233" id="P5198_1876233" name="P5198_1876233">41</a></sup> You see then that there are different stages of perfection, and that we are called by the Lord from high things to still higher in such a way that he who has become blessed and perfect in the fear of God; going as it is written "from strength to strength,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn51.htm#P5199_1876511" id="P5199_1876511" name="P5199_1876511">42</a></sup> and from one perfection to another, i.e., mounting with keenness of soul from fear to hope, is summoned in the end to that still more blessed stage, which, is love, and he who has been "a faithful and wise servant"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5200_1876757" id="P5200_1876757" name="P5200_1876757">43</a></sup> will pass to the companionship of friendship and to the adoption of sons. So then our saying also must be understood according to this meaning: not that we say that the consideration of that enduring punishment or of that blessed recompense which is promised to the saints is of no value, but because, though they are useful and introduce those who pursue them to the first beginning of blessedness, yet again love, wherein is already fuller confidence, and a lasting joy, will remove them from servile fear and mercenary hope to the love of God, and carry them on to the adoption of sons, and somehow make them from being perfect still more perfect. For the Saviour says that in His Father's house are "many mansions,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5201_1877501" id="P5201_1877501" name="P5201_1877501">44</a></sup> and although all the stars seem to be in the sky, yet there is a mighty difference between the brightness of the sun and of the moon, and between that of the morning star and the rest of the stars. And therefore the blessed Apostle prefers it not only above fear and hope but also above all gifts which are counted great and wonderful, and shows the way of love still more excellent than all. For when after finishing his list of spiritual gifts of virtues he wanted to describe its members, he began as follows: "And yet I show unto you a still more excellent way. Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and though I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me nothing." You see then that nothing more precious, nothing more perfect, nothing more sublime, and, if I may say so, nothing more enduring can be found than love. For "whether there be prophecies, they shall fail, whether there be tongues, they shall cease, whether there be knowledge, it shall be destroyed," but "love never faileth,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5202_1878734" id="P5202_1878734" name="P5202_1878734">45</a></sup> and without it not only those most excellent kinds of gifts, but even the glory of martyrdom itself will fail.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5204_1878875"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter XIII.</font></p>
<p><i> Of the fear which is the outcome of the greatest love.</i></p>
</ul><p>Whoever then has been established in this perfect love is sure to mount by a higher stage to that still more sublime fear belonging to love, which is the outcome of no dread of punishment or greed of reward, but of the greatest love; whereby a son fears with earnest affection a most indulgent father, or a brother fears his brother, a friend his friend, or a wife her husband, while there is no dread of his blows or reproaches, but only of a slight injury to his love, and while in every word as well as act there is ever care taken by anxious affection lest the warmth of his love should cool in the very slightest degree towards the object of it. And one of the prophets has finely described the grandeur of this fear, saying: "Wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation: the fear of the Lord is his treasure."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5207_1879765" id="P5207_1879765" name="P5207_1879765">46</a></sup> He could not describe with greater clearness the worth and value of that fear than by saying that the riches of our salvation, which consist in true wisdom and knowledge of God, can only be preserved by the fear of the Lord. To this fear then not sinners but saints are invited by the prophetic word where the Psalmist says: "O fear the Lord, all ye His Saints: for they that fear Him lack nothing."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5208_1880185" id="P5208_1880185" name="P5208_1880185">47</a></sup> For where a man fears the Lord with this fear it is certain that nothing is lacking to his perfection. For it was clearly of that other penal fear that the Apostle John said that "He who feareth is not made perfect in love, for fear hath punishment."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5209_1880466" id="P5209_1880466" name="P5209_1880466">48</a></sup> There is then a great difference between this fear, to which nothing is lacking, which is the treasure of wisdom and knowledge, and that imperfect fear which is called "the beginning of wisdom,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5210_1880681" id="P5210_1880681" name="P5210_1880681">49</a></sup> and which has in it punishment and so is expelled from the hearts of those who are perfect by the incoming of the fulness of love. For "there is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5211_1880903" id="P5211_1880903" name="P5211_1880903">50</a></sup> And in truth if the beginning of wisdom consists in fear, what will its perfection be except in the love Of Christ which, as it contains in it the fear which belongs to perfect love, is called not the beginning but the treasure of wisdom and knowledge? And therefore there is a twofold stage of fear. The one for beginners, i.e., for those who are still subject to the yoke and to servile terror; of which we read: "And the servant shall fear his Lord;"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5212_1881377" id="P5212_1881377" name="P5212_1881377">51</a></sup> and in the gospel: "I no longer call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth;" and therefore "the servant," He tells us, "abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5213_1881610" id="P5213_1881610" name="P5213_1881610">52</a></sup> For He is instructing us to pass on from that penal fear to the fullest freedom of love, and the confidence of the friends and sons of God. Finally the blessed Apostle, who had by the power of the Lord's love already passed through the servile stage of fear, scorns lower things and declares that he has been enriched with good things by the Lord, "for God hath not given us" he says "a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5214_1882090" id="P5214_1882090" name="P5214_1882090">53</a></sup> Those also who are inflamed with a perfect love of their heavenly Father, and whom the Divine adoption has already made sons instead of servants, he addresses in these words: "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5215_1882417" id="P5215_1882417" name="P5215_1882417">54</a></sup> It is of this fear too, that the prophet spoke when he would describe that sevenfold spirit, which according to the mystery of the Incarnation, full surely descended on the God man:<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5216_1882619" id="P5216_1882619" name="P5216_1882619">55</a></sup> "And there shall rest upon Him the Spirit of the Lord: the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of knowledge and of true godliness," and in the last place he adds as something special these words: "And the Spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5217_1882984" id="P5217_1882984" name="P5217_1882984">56</a></sup> Where we must in the first place notice carefully that he does not say "and <i>there shall rest upon Him</i> the Spirit of fear," as he said in the earlier cases, but he says "<i>there shall fill Him</i> the Spirit of the fear of the Lord." For such is the greatness of its richness that when once it has seized on a man by its power, it takes possession not of a portion but of his whole mind. And not without good reason. For as it is closely joined to that love which "never faileth," it not only fills the man, but takes a lasting and inseparable and continual possession of him in whom it has begun, and is not lessened by any allurements of temporal joy or delights, as is sometimes the case with that fear which is cast out. This then is the fear belonging to perfection, with which we are told that the God-man,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5218_1883810" id="P5218_1883810" name="P5218_1883810">57</a></sup> who came not only to redeem mankind, but also to give us a pattern of perfection and example of goodness, was filled. For the true Son of God "who did no sin neither was guile found in His mouth,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5219_1884028" id="P5219_1884028" name="P5219_1884028">58</a></sup> could not feel that servile fear of punishment.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P5221_1884094"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter XIV.</font></p>
<p><i> A question about complete chastity.</i></p>
</ul><p>Germanus: Now that you have finished your discourse on perfect chastity, we want also to ask somewhat more freely about the end of chastity. For we do not doubt that those lofty heights of love, by which, as you have hitherto explained, we mount to the image and likeness of God, cannot possibly exist without perfect purity. But we should like to know whether a lasting grant of it can be secured so that no incitement to lust may ever disturb the serenity of our heart, and that thus we may be enabled to pass the time of our sojourneying in the flesh free from this carnal passion, so as never to be inflamed by the fire of excitement.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XV.</font></p>
<p><i> The postponement of the explanation which is asked for.</i></p>
</ul><p>Chaeremon: It is indeed a sign of the utmost blessedness and of singular goodness both continually to learn and to teach that love by which we cling to the Lord, so that meditation on Him may, as the Psalmist says, occupy all the days and nights of our life,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5228_1885107" id="P5228_1885107" name="P5228_1885107">59</a></sup> and may support our soul, which insatiably hungers and thirsts after righteousness, by continually chewing the cud of this heavenly food. But we must also, in accordance with the kindly forethought of our Saviour, make some provision for the food of the body, that we faint not by the way,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5229_1885416" id="P5229_1885416" name="P5229_1885416">60</a></sup> for "the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5230_1885501" id="P5230_1885501" name="P5230_1885501">61</a></sup> And this we must now secure by taking a little food, so that after supper, the mind may be rendered more attentive for the careful tracing out of what you want.</p>
