<p><a name="P1301_576521"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>The one of these was Arius, the author of the heresy, and the other a presbyter of Alexandria bearing the same name.</p>
<p><a name="P1302_577216"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>Both the text and meaning are here obscure, we have read, with Halm, "fecisse" for the usual "factum." </p>
<p><a name="P1306_578481"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Different periods and events are here mixed up by our author.</p>
<p><a name="P1307_578817"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>The text is in utter confusion, and we can only make a probable guess at the meaning.</p>
<p><a name="P1308_579461"></a>
<sup>39 </sup>It has been remarked that Sulpitius is in error in ascribing the summoning of this council to Constantine the Great, instead of his son Constantine II. The curious thing is that he should have made a mistake regarding an event so near his own time.</p>
<p><a name="P1309_580109"></a>
<sup>40 </sup>"qui etiam nostrorum judicio haereticus probatur."</p>
<p><a name="P1313_581698"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>As Epiphanius remarks, Sabellius taught that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were all the same person, only under different appellations.</p>
<p><a name="P1314_582871"></a>
<sup>42 </sup>"libidinem." </p>
<p><a name="P1321_586546"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>The text is here in utter confusion and uncertainty. Some for "ac tum" read "nec tum," and some, instead of "judicum" read "judicium." The meaning therefore can only be guessed at.</p>
<p><a name="P1322_587190"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>The modern <i>Cagliari</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P1323_587620"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>"Piacula profiteri."</p>
<p><a name="P1324_587768"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>Instead of "refertam," some read "infectam." </p>
<p><a name="P1331_591922"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>"magistris officialibus": Halm reads "magistri."</p>
<p><a name="P1332_592212"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>"annonas et cellaria."</p>
<p><a name="P1333_593319"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>Of course, the Catholics, or orthodox. </p>
<p><a name="P1337_594919"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>"per vicarium ac praesidem": as Vorstius remarks, these were the two magistrates of Phrygia.</p>
<p><a name="P1338_595876"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>"trionymam solitarii Dei unionem": Hornius here remarks that "Sabellius believed that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were the same, and differed among themselves only in name." </p>
<p><a name="P1345_601095"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>The text is very uncertain; we have followed that of Halm, but the common text inserts a "non," and reads thus: "but the Son of God is not pronounced equal to the Father, and without beginning," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P1346_601390"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>"sine tempore."</p>
<p><a name="P1350_603819"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>"seminarium": lit. seed-plot. </p>
<p><a name="P1351_604994"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>The modern <i>Perigueux</i>.</p>
<p><a name="P1355_606065"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>"superstitio exitiabilis": the very words which Tacitus employs, when speaking of Christianity itself (<i>Annal</i>. xv. 44).</p>
<p><a name="P1356_606238"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>"arcanis occultata secretis": it is impossible to say what is the exact meaning of these words.</p>
<p><a name="P1357_607364"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>"profanarum rerum."</p>
<p><a name="P1358_608053"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>"perfidiae istius." </p>
<p><a name="P1362_610754"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>The text has merely "extra omnes terras."</p>
<p><a name="P1366_611665"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>Some read <i>Euchrocia</i>, and so afterwards.</p>
<p><a name="P1367_612610"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>"magistro officiorum."</p>
<p><a name="P1371_613366"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>This appears to be the meaning, but the text is obscure. </p>
<p><a name="P1372_614441"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>"clemens": some read "Clementen," and join it with "Maximum."</p>
<p><a name="P1373_615143"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>"labes illa."</p>
<p><a name="P1380_619249"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>Halm prefers the form "Sylinancim" to "Sylinam." The reference is probably to the Scilly Isles. </p>
<p><a name="P1381_620069"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>The meaning seems to be, that Ithacius being blamed for bringing accusations against his brethren, at first defended his conduct by an appeal to the laws and the public weal, both of which justified the prosecution of heretics; but being at last driven from this position, he turned round and cast the blame upon those for whom he had acted.</p>
<p><a name="P1382_620541"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>Some read "solitus," instead of "sollicitus. </p>
