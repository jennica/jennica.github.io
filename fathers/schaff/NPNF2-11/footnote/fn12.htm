<p><a name="P1256_554409"></a>
<sup>20 </sup>Some words have here been lost, but the critics are not agreed as to what should be supplied.</p>
<p><a name="P1257_554566"></a>
<sup>21 </sup>As Vorstius suggests, we have here taken Jonathan as a nominative, but the passage is very obscure. </p>

<p><a name="P1283_569178"></a>
<sup>29 </sup>These were half-Jews and half-Christians, and were known at a later date under the name of Nazarites. They made use of what was called the Gospel according to the Hebrews.</p>
