<sup>1 </sup>"ex vicariis." </p>
<p><a name="P602_237320"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>The text of this sentence is very uncertain, and the meaning somewhat obscure.</p>
<p><a name="P609_240388"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Here, again, the text is in confusion.</p>
<p><a name="P610_240884"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Text and meaning both very obscure. </p>
<p><a name="P611_241270"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>"nos pie praestruere profitemur historiae veritatem."</p>
<p><a name="P619_247290"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>"agmina damnanda." </p>
<p><a name="P624_248261"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>"exsufflans." </p>
<p><a name="P631_252111"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>"captivum suem." Probably there is here an allusion to the capture of the Erymanthian boat by Hercules, with a punning reference to a secondary meaning of <i>sus</i> as a kind of fish. </p>
<p><a name="P641_256579"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>"potestatem regiam." </p>
<p><a name="P649_262305"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>The text here is very corrupt: we have followed a conjecture of Halm's.</p>
<p><a name="P653_264852"></a>
<sup>11 </sup>"Pseudothyrum": Halm prefers the form "pseudoforum," but the meaning is the same.   </p>
<p><a name="P657_266166"></a>
<sup>12 </sup>It is obvious that, in this whole passage, Sulpitius has in his mind the language of St. Paul, Rom. i. 9-12.</p>
<p><a name="P686_278884"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Halm reads <i>proesentia</i>, instead of the old reading <i>perseverantia</i>`, but apparently without good grounds.</p>
<p><a name="P687_279598"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Luke ix. 62.</p>
<p><a name="P691_280381"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Ezek. xviii. 24. </p>
<p><a name="P692_280928"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>Clericus here remarks that "these words clearly teach us that Severus knew of no other purgation than that by which we are cleansed in this life from sin by a change of character and which change if we steadily maintain, then, when life is ended, we are received into the abode of Christ, without any dread of the fire of purgatory."</p>
<p><a name="P696_282504"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>"conversatione."</p>
<p><a name="P697_282570"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>Having led us into sin that we might be condemned along with himself. The meaning, however, is obscure.</p>
<p><a name="P698_282937"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Abraham lived (in round numbers) about 2000 years B.C.., and assuming the beginning of the world to have been about 4000 years B.C.., he may thus be said to have lived about "the mid-time." The note of Clericus which refers the words to the <i>end</i> of the world seems quite mistaken.</p>
