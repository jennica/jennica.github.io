<p>
The Early Church Fathers is a 38-volume collection of writings from
the first 800 years of the Church.  This collection is divided into
three series, Ante-Nicene (ANF), Nicene and Post-Nicene Series I
(NPNF1), and Nicene and Post-Nicene Series II (NPNF2).
<p>
These files have the majority of the text printed in the actual 
books, but the indexes are not included. In fact, Volume IX
of the Ante-Nicene Series, which consists entirely of index
information, is not available. 
[Adapted from the introduction to the 
<a href="/web/19991013025728/http://ccel.org/info/ebs.html">Electronic Bible Society</a> CD-ROM Volume 1,
the source of the text files for the original Early Church Fathers
page.]
<p>
In these files you will see Greek and Hebrew text transliterated
into the Roman alphabet.  To see them Greek and Hebrew in their
own alphabets, you should install two public-domain fonts: SPTiberian
and SPIonic.  (In Windows 95, install with the fonts control panel.)
You can <a href="/web/19991013025728/http://ccel.org/help/fonts">download</a> these fonts
for Mac or Windows from this server.
<p>
The zipped text files that are available for all volumes are the
original text files from the Electronic Bible Society.  These files
are full of scanning errors and do not have footnotes or prefaces.
<p>
These files are in reasonably good shape, for the most part, but there
are some significant caveats:  the footnotes don't all line up
properly and there are occasional missing pieces. A third revision 
of these files will eventually appear, based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013025728/http://www.ccel.org/ThML">ThML</a>.  Much proofreading and
editing must be done; if you are interested in proofreading a volume
please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013025728/mailto:hplantin@calvin.edu">drop me a note</a>.

<p>
You can get all of the HTML files on the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013025728/http://ccel.org/cdrom/cdrom.html">CCEL CD-ROM</a>.
Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991013025728/http://www.logos.com/">Logos Research Systems</a> 
publishes the Early Church Fathers in the Logos Library System for 
around $300 MSRP.
