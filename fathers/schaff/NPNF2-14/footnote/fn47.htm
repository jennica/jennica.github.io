<sup>1 </sup>They were therefore Nestorians. </p>

<sup>1 </sup>The text, as the side note remarks, "seems to be mutilated and depraved "in this passage, but the meaning is clear enough as given by Hefele in the note. </p>

<sup>1 </sup>This whole paragraph reads with material differences in the Latin. Moreover while the Greek text is clear and grammatical, the Latin is most incorrect and halting. Leo is described as "Pope of the city of Rome," instead of "bishop of Rome."</p>
<p><a name="P4754_945188"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>This statement, so absolutey contrary to fact. has been a sore dificulty to the commentators. Arendt (<i>Leo the Great and his Times, ยง</i> 270) says that this meant only that "he had, without permission of the Pope, taken the presidency there, and conducted the proceedings, for Leo himself had acknowledged the synod by the fact that he allowed his legates to be present at it." Almost the same is the explanation of the Ballerini (Leo M. <i>Opera</i>, Tom. ii. 460. n. 15.)</p>

<sup>3 </sup>The Latin here has the usual form "amplissimus senatus," for which the Greek is<font face="SPIonic"> perifane/statoi sugkletikoi</font><font>;. </font></p>
