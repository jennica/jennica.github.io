<sup>1 </sup>Rohrbacher, in his famous <i>Histoire Universelle de l'Élise Catholique</i>, Tome IV,. (Septième Edition), Livre xxxix., p.394, informs us that this letter gives the names of some of Cyril's calumniators! The text he used must have heen different from the one now accessible to scholars. </p>

<sup>2 </sup>This passage is very difficult and I have followed the Latin in omitting one <font face="SPIonic">Qeo/n</font><font>. </font></p>

<sup>3 </sup>There is a most curious blunder in the editing of this Epistle in Migne, where this passage, which is but one text, viz.: Isaiah xxv. 8 is made into two, the first few words being assigned in the margin to Hosea, xiii. 14. As a matter of fact the whole sentence is turned into nonsense by making the words <font face="SPIonic">kai\ pa/lin</font><font> as a connective supplied by St. Cyril. What the text really says is that Death prevailed indeed, but God wiped away again the tears death had caused. The same error is found in the letter as it occurs in Labbe and Cossart, and it should be remarked that it is both in the Greek and Latin. I rather suspect that St. Cyril had a purer text of the LXX. than ours which read-"And he hath swallowed death up and hath wiped away, etc.," as the Vulgate and A. V. read. This is the reading the context certainly seems to call for.</font></p>

<sup>2 </sup>This is a late form of Qeiws, but used only in its secondary sense. </p>
