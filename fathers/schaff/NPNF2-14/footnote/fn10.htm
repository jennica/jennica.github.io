<sup>2 </sup>In 1836, the Lutheran Pastor Fliedner, of a little town on the Rhine, opened a parish hospital the nurses of which he called "Deaconesses". This "Deaconess House "at Kaiserswerth. was the mother-house from which all the deaconess establishments of the present day have taken their origin. The Methodists have adopted the system successfully. Some efforts have been made to domesticate it, in a somewhat modified form, also in the Anglican Churches but thus far with but little success. Of course these "Deaconesses" resemble the Deaconesses of the Early Church only in name. The reader who may be interested in seeing an effort to connect the modern deaconess with the deaconess of antiquity is referred to T<i>he Ministry of Deaconesses</i> by Deaconess Cecilia Robinson. This book. it should be said, contains much valuable and accurate information upon the subject, but accepts as proven facts the suppositions of the late Bishop Lightfoot upon the subject ; who somewhat rashly asserted that "the female daconate is as definite an institution as the male diaconate. Phoebe is as much a deacon as Stephen or Philip is a deacon!" </p>
