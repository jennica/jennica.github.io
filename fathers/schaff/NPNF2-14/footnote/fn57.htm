<sup>2 </sup>The text is, I think corrupt, at all events the Latin and Greek do not agree. </p>
<p><a name="P5741_1218848"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>In this sentence I have followed De Marca's Latin version, but I must confess that I am not at all satisfied with the construing of the long phrase beginning <font face="SPIonic">Ou$twj w,j</font><font>. </font></p>
<p><a name="P5747_1222139"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>The reader will notice that this is hardly distinguishable from the "moral growth" and "ethical development" which the modern "kenotists" attribute to the Incarnate Son of God. </p>
<p><a name="P5757_1227105"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>i.e. a.d. 553.</p>
<p><a name="P5761_1227416"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>The last sentence of the <i>Constitutum</i>, the sentence which the Pope gave and which the council rejected, is as follows: "We ordain and decree that it be permitted to no one who stands in ecclesiastical order of office, to write or bring forward, or undertake, or teach anything contrary to the contents of this Constitutum in regard to the Three Chapters. or, after this declaration begin a new controversy about them. And if anything has already been done or spoken in regard of the Three Chapters in contradiction of this our ordinance by anyone whomsoever, this we declare void by the authority of the Apostolic See." It is perfectly clear that the Emperor is the "anyone" referred to. </p>
<p><a name="P5793_1232525"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>The word "our" omitted in the Latin. </p>
