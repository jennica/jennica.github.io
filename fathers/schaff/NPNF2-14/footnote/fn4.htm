<sup>17 </sup>It was written in Latin but, says Bury (Appendix to Vol. V. of Gibbon's <i>Rome</i>, p.525), "was also immediately after its publication in Latin, issued (perhaps incompletely) in a Greek form (Cf. Zacharia Von Lingenthal, <i>Gr. Röm. Recht</i>, p.6). Most of the later Novels are Greek, and Novel vij. [15, ed. Zach.] expressly recognizes the necessity of using `the common Greek tongue.0'"</p>

<sup>18 </sup>This is clearly set forth by Pope Vitilius as follows : "No one can doubt that our fathers believed that they should receive with veneration the letter of blessed Leo if they declared it to agree with the doctrines of the Nicene and Constantinopolitan Councils, as also with those of blessed Cyril, set forth in tue first of Ephesus. And if that letter of so great a Pontiff, shining with so bnight a light of the orthodox Faith, needed to be approved by these comparisons, how can that letter to Maris the Persian, which specially rejects the First Council of Ephesus and declares to be heretics the expressed doctrines of the blessed Cyril, he believed to have been called orthodox by these same Fathers, condemning as it does those writings, by comparison with which, as we have said, the doctrine of so great a Pontiff deserved to be commended ? "-Vigil., <i>Constitutum pro dammatione Trium Capitulorum</i>. Migne, <i>Pat. Lat</i>., tom. lxix., col. 162.</p>

<sup>20 </sup>About twenty-five years ago Mr. Eugene Rèvillout discovered, in the Museum of Turin, two fragments in Coptic which he supposed to be portions of the Acts of this Council (of whict the rest are still missing) incorporated into the Acts of a Council held at Alexandria in 362. But there is too little known abont these fragments to attribute to them any fixed value. I therefore only refer the reader to the literature on the subject-<i>Journal Asiatique</i>, Fevrier-Mars, 1873 <i>Annales de Philosophie Chrétiennc</i>, Juin, 1873; <i>Revue de Questions Historiques</i>, Avril, 1874; M. W. Guetteée, <i>Histoire de l' Église,</i> t. III,.,p. 21; Eugène Révillout, <i>LeConcile de Nicée et le Concile d' Alexandrie</i></p>
<p>d'après les textes Coptes. </p>
