<sup>1 </sup>These words are omitted in Zonaras's Greek ! The very gist of the matter for the Easterns.</p>

<sup>2 </sup>These words are omitted in Zonaras's Greek ! The very gist of the matter for the Easterns.</p>
<p><a name="P10006_1852267"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>These will be found translated in full in the Oxford "Library of the Fathers," Vol.17. "St. Cyprian's Epistles," p. 286; also in the American reprint of the " "Ante-Nicene Fathers," Vol. V. "Hippolitus, Cyprian, etc.,"" p.565. </p>
<p><a name="P10043_1860508"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Who was possibly at least not the president, vide Michaud. Sept. <i>Conc. Oeum√©niques</i>, p.330.</p>
<p><a name="P10044_1860986"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Worship is "relative "or "absolote", what Gibbon means by "direct" would be hard to say. How entirely false the whole statement is, Gibbon himself would have recognized had be read the acts.</p>
<p><a name="P10047_1861999"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Dr. Neale complains that the acts display a painful lack of critical knowledge and that several spurious passages are attributed to tbe Fathers. But I confess this does not seem to me either surprising or disgraceful. The attributing of books, even in our critical days, to persons who were not their authors is not so uncommon as to make us wonder such a thing might have occurred in such stormy times, when learning of this sort must have suffered by the adversities of the Church and State, the Iconoclastic persecutions and the Moslem incursions. </p>
<p><a name="P10055_1864474"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>"It is certain," confesses Dr. Neale (<i>History of the Holy Eastern Church</i>, Vol. II., p.113; in his attempt to overthrow the authority of this council) "that Poiltian approved (S. Theod. Stud. Ep. xviij.) although he was not present at the council of Nicea; and the controversy, which had never much disturbed Africa, may henceforth be considered as terminated in the Diocese of Alexandria."</p>
<p><a name="P10059_1867225"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>As a sample of all that bigotry and dishonesty can do when writing on such a subject, the reader is referred to a little book by the R ev. F. Meyrick (a canon of the Church of England) published in Paris for the Anglo-Continental Society. 1877, entitled, <i>Du Schisme d'Orient et de l'authorite du pretendu septieme concile.</i> </p>
<p><a name="P10067_1873321"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>The true date is 825.</p>
<p><a name="P10080_1880356"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>Vide the Synod's Letter to the Emperor and Empress. </p>
<p><a name="P10083_1882862"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The treatise of St. John Damascene on <i>The Holy Images </i>has very recently been published in an English translation by M. H. Allies. (London. Thos. Baker, 1898.) </p>
<p><a name="P10088_1883036"></a>
<sup>1 </sup><font>"Divine" here, as usually in such connections, means "imperial".</font></p>
<p><a name="P10089_1883110"></a>
<sup>2 </sup><font>Mendham (<i>The Seventh General Council, the Second of Nicea</i>.. Loodon, s.d.) by a curious blunder takes the adjective for the substantive, and translates "The Sacred Divalis". This is a mere trip, for he knows the word "sacra", as appears a few pages further on. </font></p>
