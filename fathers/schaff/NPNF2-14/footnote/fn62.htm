<sup>1 </sup>Clement VIII. made a decree in conforinity with this canon that a Greek presbyter who was married shall abstain from his wife for a week or three days before he offered the sacrifice of the mass. <i>Const. 33, in Bull. Rom</i> (<i>cit</i>. Van Espen<i> l.c</i>.)</p>

<sup>1 </sup>A faculty is allowed for earlier ordination, but since 1804 only to be granted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. This limitation is, however, only of Parliamentary sanction (44 Geo. III., ch. 43.). </p>

<sup>1 </sup>It is curious that so learned a scholar as the late Henry Bradsbsw in his article ""Subdeacon"" in Smith &amp; Cheetham's<i> Dictionary of Christ. Antiq</i>. should give the date of this synod as 447. Hefele fixes it at 527 or 531. Baronius, Binius. Lablbe, and many others at 531. A very ancient ms. assigns it to the year 565 of the Spanish era, i.e. 527, and this is the date Cardinal de Aguirre adopts, and is also the one given to the council by the editors of <i>L'Art de VÃ©rifier les dates</i>.</p>

<sup>1 </sup>I have not followed the Oxford translation, which seems to me to have reversed the point. In a foot-note to that translation (Chrysostom on Acts, Part I., p.199) will be found a translation of this canon. </p>

<sup>1 </sup>Can this mean the Pope?</p>
