<font size="4">Extracts from the Acts. Session I.</font></h2>
<p align="CENTER"> (Labbe and Cossart, Concilia, Tom. VI., col. 609 et seqq.)</p>
<p>[After a history of the assembly of the Council, the Acts begin with the Speech of the Papal Legatee, as follows:]</p>
<p>Most benign lord, in accordance with the Sacra to our most holy Pope<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5793_1232525" id="P5793_1232525" name="P5793_1232525">1</a></sup> from your God-instructed majesty, we have been sent by him to the most holy footsteps of your God-confirmed serenity, bearing with us his suggestion (<font face="SPIonic">a0naFora=j</font>, <i>suggestione</i>) as well as the other suggestion of his Synod equally addressed to your divinely preserved Piety by the venerable bishops subject to it, which also we offered to your God-crowned Fortitude. Since, then, during the past forty-six years, more or less, certain novelties in expression, contrary to the Orthodox faith, have been introduced by those who were at several times bishops of this, your royal and God-preserved city, to wit: Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also by Cyrus, at one time archbishop of the city of Alexandria, as well also as by Theodore, who was bishop of a city called Pharan, and by certain others their followers, and since these things have in no small degree brought confusion into the Church throughout the whole world, for they taught dogmatically that there was but one will in the dispensation of the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ, one of the Holy Trinity, and one operation; and since many times your servant, our apostolic see, has fought against this, and then prayed against it, and by no means been able, even up to now, to draw away from such a depraved opinion its advocates, we beseech your God-crowned fortitude, that such as share these views of the most holy church of Constantinople may tell us, what is the source of this new-fangled language.</p>
<p>[Answer of the Monothelites made at the Emperor's bidding:]We have brought out no new method of speech, but have taught whatever we havereceived from the holy Ecumenical Synods, and from the holy approved Fathers, as well as from the archbishops of this imperial city, to wit: Sergius, Paul, Pyrrhus, and Peter, as also from Honorius who was Pope of Old Rome, and from Cyrus who was Pope of Alexandria, that is to say with reference to will and operation, and so we have believed, and so we believe, so we preach; and further we are ready to stand by, and defend this faith. </p>
