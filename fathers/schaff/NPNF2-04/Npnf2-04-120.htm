<sup>1 </sup>He was unable to speak from memory of the events of the persecution of 303 (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 64), but (<i>de Incarn.</i> 56. 2) had been instructed in religion by persons who had suffered as martyrs. This must have been before 311, the date of the last persecution in Egypt under Maximin. Before 319 he had written his first books `against the Gentiles,' the latter of which, on the Incarnation, implies a full maturity of power in the writer, while the former is full of philosophical and mythological knowledge such as argues advanced education. But from several sources we learn that his election to the episcopate in 328 was impugned, at any rate in after years, on the ground of his not having attained the canonical age of thirty. There is no ground for supposing that this was true: but such a charge would not be made without some ground at least of plausibility. We must therefore suppose that on June 8, 328, he was not much beyond his thirtieth year. His parents, moreover, were living after the year 358 (see below, p. 562, note 6); allowing them over fourscore years at that date, we find in 298 a reasonable date for the birth of their son. We must remember that in southern climates mind and body mature somewhat more rapidly than with ourselves, and `contra Gentes' and `de Incarnatione' will scarcely appear precocious.</p>

<sup>3 </sup>The actual connection of Athanasius with Antony at this period is implied in the received text of `Vit. Anton.' <i>Prolog.,</i> for it could scarcely fall at any later date. At the same time the youthful life of Athanasius seems fully accounted for in such a way as to leave little room for it (so Tillemont). But our ignorance of details leaves it just possible that he may for a time have visited the great hermit and ministered to him as Elisha did of old to Elijah. (Cf. p. 195, note 2.)</p>

<sup>4 </sup>It is of interest to note the changed conditions. In 260 bishop Dionysius had to check the Monarchian tendency in Libya, and was accused by members of his own flock of separating the Son from the Being (<font face="SPIonic" size="6">ousia</font><font size="6">) of the Father. In 319 a Libyan, Atius, cries out upon the Sabellianism of his bishop, and formulates the very doctrine which Dionysius had been accused of maintaining. </font></p>

<sup>5 </sup>The chronology cannot be determined with precision. The Memorandum is signed by Colluthus and therefore precedes his schism. The letter to Alex. Byzant. was written after the Colluthian schism had begun. But the proceedings of Eusebius described above had at least begun when the Memorandum was circulated, which must, therefore, have been some time after the Synod of 321. The letter of Alexander to his clergy prefixed to the <i>depositio</i> was drawn up after it. and includes the names of the Mareotic seceders. We may, therefore, tentatively adopt the following series:-321 a.d.: Egyptian Synod deposes Arius. Arius in correspondence with Eusebius, &amp;c Leaves Alexandria for Palestine and Nicomedia. Letters sent abroad by Alexander. Eusebius holds council and writes to Alexander. 322: Memorandum drawn up; Alexandrian clergy assemble to sign it; prefatory address to them by Alexander with reference to the Mareotic defection which has just occurred; circulation of Memorandum; schism, of Colluthus. 323: Letter of Alexander to Alexander of Byzantium; (Sept.) Constantine, master of the East, and ready to intervene in the controversy. </p>

<sup>8 </sup>A term first brought into currency in this connection by Mr. Gwatkin (p. 38, note), and since adopted by many writers including Harnack; in spite of the obvious objection to the importations of political terms into the grave questions of this period, the term is too useful to be surrendered, and the `conservatives' of the Post-Nicene reaction were in fact too often political in their methods and spirit. The <i>truly</i> conservative men, here as in other instances, failed to enlist the sympathy of the conservative rank and file.</p>

<sup>11 </sup>Hort pp. 138, 139, and 59: the changes well classified by Gwatkin, p. 41, cf. Harnack 2, vol 2, p. 227 The main alterations were (1) The elimination of the word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">logoj</font><font size="6"> and substitution of </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">uioj</font><font size="6"> in the principal place. This struck at the theology of Eusebius even more directly than at that of Arius. (2) The addition not only of </font><font face="SPIonic">omoousion tw patri</font><font size="6">, but also of </font><font face="SPIonic">toutestin ek thj ousiaj tou patroj</font><font size="6"> between </font><font face="SPIonic">monogenh</font><font size="6"> and </font><font face="SPIonic">qeon</font><font size="6"> as a further qualification of </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhqenta</font><font size="6"> (specially against Euseb.

<sup>12 </sup>The events have been related in what seems to be their most likely order, but there is no real certainty in the matter. It is clear that there were at least two public sittings (Soz. i. 17, the language of Eus. <i>V.C.</i> iii. 10, is reconcileable with this) in the emperor's presence, at the first of which the <i>libelli</i> were burned and the bishops requested to examine the question of faith. This was probably. on June 19. The tearing up of the creed of Eus. Nic. seems from the account of Eustathius to have come immediately before the final adoption of a creed. The creed of Eusebius of Caesarea, which was the basis of that finally adopted, must therefore have been propounded after the failure of his namesake. (Montfaucon and others are clearly wrong in supposing that <i>this</i> was the `blasphemy' which was torn to pieces!) The difficulty is, where to put the dramatic scene of whisperings, nods, winks, and evasions which compelled the bishops to apply a drastic test. I think (with Kölling, &amp;c.) that it must have preceded the proposal of Eusebius, upon which the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">omoousion</font><font size="6"> was quietly insisted on by Constantine; for the latter was the only occasion (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">profasij</font><font size="6">) of any modification in the Caesarean Creed, which in itself does not correspond to the tests described <i>infr.</i> p. 163. But Montfaucon and others, followed by Gwatkin, place the scene in question <i>after</i> the proposal of Eus. Caes. and the resolution to modify his creed by the insertion of a stringent test,-in fact at the `pause' of the council before its final resolution, This conflicts with the clear statement of Eusebius that the </font><font face="SPIonic">omoousion</font><font size="6"> was the `thin end of the wedge' which led to the entire recasting of his creed (see <i>infr.</i> p. 73. The idea of Kölling, p. 208, that the creed of Eusebius was drawn up by him for the occasion, and that the </font><font face="SPIonic">maqhma</font><font size="6">h of the council was ready beforehand as an alternative document, is refuted by the relation of the two documents; see Hort, pp. 138, 139). It follows, therefore, from the combined accounts of Ath., Euseb. and Eustathius (our only eye-witnesses) that (1) the fathers were practically resolved upon the </font><font face="SPIonic">omoousion</font><font size="6"> before the final sitting. (2) That this resolve was clinched by the creed of Eusebius of Nicomedia. (3) That Eusebius of Caesarea made his proposal when it was too late to think of half-measures. (4) That the creed of Eusebius was modified at the Emperor's direction (which presupposes the willingness of the Council). (5) That this revision was immediately followed by the signatures and the close of the council. The work of revision, however, shews such signs of attention to detail that we are almost compelled to assume at least one adjournment of the final sitting. When the other business of the council was transacted, including the settlement of the Easter question, the Meletian schism, and the Canons, it is impossible to say. Kaelling <i>suo jure</i> puts them at the first public session. The question must be left open, as must that of the presidency of the council. The conduct of the proceedings was evidently in the hands of Constantine, so that the question of presidency reduces itself to that of identifying the bishop on Constantine's right who delivered the opening address to the Emperor: this was certainly not Hosius (see Vit. C. iii. 11, and vol. 1 of this series, p. 19), but may have been Eusebius of Caesarea, who probably after a few words from Eustathius (Thdt.) or Alexander (Theod. Mops. and Philost.) was entrusted with so congenial a task. The name of Hosius stands first on the extant list of signatures, and he may have signed first, although the lists are bad witnesses. The words of Athanasius sometimes quoted in this connection (p. 256), `over what synod did he not; preside?' must be read in connection with the distinction made by Theodoret in quoting the passage in question (<i>H.E.</i> ii. 15) that Hosius 'was <i>very prominent</i> at the great synod of Nicae, and <i>presided</i> over those who assembled at Sardica. This is the only evidence we possess to which any weight can be attached. </font></p>

<sup>14 </sup>While yet the distinction between the `presence' and `existence' of God in Christ (Newman, <i>Ar.</i> 4. p. 123) is very delicate: both ideas are covered by `Dasein'. The two forms of Monarchianism are related exactly as the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity is to the Nestorian.</p>

<sup>15 </sup>Our authorities are Hippolytus <i>Philosophum.,</i> Tertullian<i>Against Praxeas,</i> and the early fragment `against heresies' printed in Tertullian's works. The statements of Tertullian and Hippolytus agree remarkably, though obviously independent. The first (modalist) Monarchian teacher in Rome was Praxeas (Tert.) from Asia, who was followed by the pupils of Noetus, also an Asiatic (Hippol.), Epigonus (Renan <i>Marc-Aurèle</i> 230, note, identifies `Praxeas' with Epigonus; I cannot undertake to pronounce upon the point, but see Harnack, <i>Dogmg.</i> 11. p. 608) and Cleomenes. Praxeas arrived in Rome under Victor (or earlier, Harnack, p. 610), and combined strong opposition to Montanism, with equally strong modalism in his theology. In both respects his influence told upon the heads of the Church. Montanism was expelled, Modalism tolerated, Theodotus excommunicated; `Duo negotia diaboli Praxeas Romae procuravit: prophetiam expulit et haeresin intulit: Paracletum fugavit et Patrein crucifixit'. (Tert.) `Praxeas haeresin introduxit quam Victor[inus] (perhaps a confusion with Zephyrinus) corroborate curavit' (`Tertullian' <i>adv. Haer.</i>)</p>

<sup>20 </sup>The formula <font face="SPIonic" size="6">ktisma o uioj</font><font size="6"> is ascribed to Origen by the anti-Chalcedonists of the sixth century, but is probably a `consequenz-macherei' from the above; see Caspari <i>Alte v.

But </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ktisma</font><font size="6"> was sometimes applied to the Son in a vague sense, on the ground of Prov. viii. 22, a text not used in this way by Origen.</font></p>

<sup>22 </sup>The position of Eusebius of Caesarea is at the `extreme left' of the Origenist body. (`A reflex of the unsolved problems of the Church of that time,' Dorner.) It is as though Dionysius instead of withdrawing and modifying his incriminated statements, had involved them in a haze of explanations and biblical phrases which left them where they were. But this is not so much Arianism as confusion. `All is hollow and empty, precarious and ambiguous. With a vast apparatus of biblical expressions and the use of every possible formula, Monotheism is indeed maintained, but practically a created subordinate God is inserted between God and mankind' (Harnack, p. 648). See also Dorner, <i>Lehre der Pers. Chr.</i> Pt. 1, pp. 793-798. The language quoted by Ath. below, p. 459, was doubtless meant by Eusebius in an Origenist sense.</p>

<sup>23 </sup>The theological genesis of Paul's system is obscure. The theory of Newman that he was under strong Jewish influences is largely based upon the late and apparently quite erroneous tradition that his patroness Zenobia was a Jewess; see p. 296, note 9a, and Gwatkin, p. 57, and note 3. Harnack regards him as the representative of `archaic' East-Syrian adoptionism such as pervades the `Discussion of Archelaus with Manes;' see Routh, <i>Rell.</i> v. especially pp. 178-184. But Paul would not have spoken of Mary as `Dei Genetrix,' p. 128; I cannot see more in these `Acta' than a naive adoptionism homologous to the `naive modalism' of much early Christian language, but like it not representative of the entire view of those who use it; we must also note that the statements of `Archelaus' are coloured by reaction against the docetism of `Manes;' but Paul may well have taken up this naive adoptionism, and, <i>by srict Aristotelian logic,</i> developed it as the exclusive basis of his system. Whether Paul's use of the idea of the Logos betrays the faintest influence of Origen is to me, at least, extremely uncertain. </p>

<sup>25 </sup>It was pointed out clearly by Newman, <i>Arians,</i> pp. 8, 403, but with an eagerly drawn inference to the discredit of the later Antiochene School and of the genuine principles of exegesis as recognised at the present day by Protestants and Catholics alike (see Wetzer und Welte-Kaulen, <i>Kirchen-Lexicon,</i> i. 953 <i>sqq.,</i> iv. 1116, and Patrizzi as abridged in Cornel. a Lap. <i>in Apoc.</i> ed.

<sup>33 </sup>This illustrates the famous paradox of Cardinal Newman (<i>Development,</i> ed. 1878, pp. 142-4), that the condemnation of Arian Christology <i>left vacant</i> a throne in heaven which the medieval Church legitimately filled with the Blessed Virgin; that the Nicene condemnation of the Arian theology is the vindication of the medieval; that `the rotaries of Mary do not exceed the true faith, unless the blasphemers of her Son come up to it.' But the qestion here was one of <i>worship,</i> not of <i>theology.</i> The Arians <i>worshipped</i> Christ, whom they regarded as a created being: therefore, the Nicene fathers urge with one consent, they were idolaters. The idea of a created being <i>capable of being worshipped</i> was as Arian legacy to the Church, no doubt. But this very idea, to Athanasius and Hilary, marked them out as idolaters. It was reserved for later times `to find a subject for an Arian predicate' (Mozley). The argument is an astonishing admission.</p>

The protests of the poposition were apparently disregarded and Athanasius consecrated before the other side considered the question as closed, (The statement of Epiph.

<sup>56 </sup>The ordinary time for the entry of the Prefect upon his duties seems to have been about the end of the Egyptian Year (end of August). Accordingly the prefectures and years in <i>Fest.

According to the headings to the Festal Letters vi., vii., he had superseded Paternus in 334: either the Index or the headings are mistaken. For the popularity of Philagrius, see Greg. Naz. <i>Orat.</i> xxi. 28, who mentions that his reappointment was due to the request of a deputation from Alex. (this must have come from the Arians!) and that the rejoicings which welcomed his return exceeded any that could have greeted the Emperor, and <i>nearly</i> equalled those which had welcomed the return of Athanasius himself.

<sup>58 </sup>Gregory shewed his Arianism by employing Ammon as his secretary, see p. 96. The curious parallelism between Gregory and George (<i>infr.</i> §8),-the names differing (in Latin) by a single letter only, both Arians, both Cappadocians, both intruded bishops of Alexandria, both arriving from court, both arriving in Lent, both exercising violence, both charged by Ath. with the storming of churches, with similar scenes of desecration, maltreatment of virgins, &amp;c., in either case,-is one of the strangest examples of history repeating itself within a few years. What wonder that the fifth-century historians confuse the two still further together, and that they still find followers? The most important point of confusion is the alleged murder of Gregory (due to Theodoret), who really died a natural death. It is none too soon for this time-honoured blunder to do the like. On the inveterate tendency of Georges and Gregories to coalesce, and exchange names in transcription (to say nothing of modern typography), see D.C.B. ii. pp. 640-650, 778 <i>sq.,</i> 798 <i>sq., passim.</i></p>

<sup>63 </sup>On the one hand the deputation after the council reached Constantius at Antioch about Easter (April 15), 344. They were, however sent not directly by the Council, but by Constans after its close (Thdt. ii. 8). We may be certain that their arrival at Antioch was at the very least two months after the close of the council; but in all probability the interval was much longer. Again, the course of events described above forbids us to put the council earlier than the early summer of 343. But according to the <i>Festal Index</i> xv. the council <i>at any rate began</i> before the end of August in that year. If the bishops left their churches after Easter (a very natural and usual arrangement, compare Nicaea, the Dedication, &amp;c.), they could easily assemble by the end of June. The Orientals came somewhat later. The beginning of July is accordingly our <i>terminus a quo,</i> the end of January our <i>terminus ad quem.</i> What exact part of the interval the council occupied we cannot decide. </p>

<sup>73 </sup>This date, coming from the common source of the <i>Historia Acephala</i> and <i>Festal Index</i> (i.e. from the accredited Alexandrian chronology of the period), must be accepted unless there is cogent proof of its incorrectness. No such proof is offered: we have <i>no positive statement to the contrary,</i> but only (1) the fact that the intrusion of George is related, <i>Apol. Fug.</i> 6, immediately after an attack on the great church, possibly the <i>coup de main</i> of Syrianus, but more probably that of p. 290, note 9, without any hint of a long interval. This is true, and <i>if there were no evidence the other way</i> might justify a <i>guess</i> that George came in Lent, 356; but no one would claim that the passage is conclusive by itself; (2) the `improbability' of George delaying his arrival so long. Improbability is a relative term; we know too little of George's consecration or movements to justify its use in the present connection. All the evidence goes to shew that the court party were far from sanguine as to the nature of his reception, and that their misgivings were well-founded. The above considerations look very small when we compare them with the mass of positive evidence the other way. (1.) The civil Governor had changed: Maximus held the post on Feb. 8, 356 (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 81, &amp;c.), Cataphronius when the churches were transferred to the party of George, see below, 6. (2.) The military Commander had changed: Syrianus was replaced by Sebastian, who appears just after the transfer of churches, <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 55-60 (Dr. Bright in D.C.B. i. 194, <i>note,</i> seems to admit that Sebastian belongs to a later date than the Lent of 356). (3.) The Wednesday (and Thursday) of <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 55 were <i>not</i> `in Lent.' They suit the data of <i>Hist. Aceph.</i> perfectly well. (4.) Had George arrived before Easter 356, Athan. would have heard of it `in the Desert,' <i>Apol. Const.</i> 27; but he has only heard of his <i>nomination</i> <font face="SPIonic" size="6">wnomasqh</font><font size="6"> 28, probably from the letters given in §§30, 31). (5.) The Letter to the Egyptian bishops was written from Libya or Cyrenaica, when the coercion of the episcopate had begun: it postulates some time since his expulsion, but George was then (§7) only in contemplation. (6.) There is no evidence that the <i>coup de main</i> of Syrianus was other than unpopular in the city. This was reported to Const., who <i>after</i> the (Easter) outrages on the Virgins (<i>Ap. Const.</i> 27; <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 48), and <i>after</i> the expulsion of the sixteen bishops (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 54, this was probably about Easter, <i>Ap. Const.</i> 27) sent Heraclius (with the `discreditable' letter), in <i>whose company</i> (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 55) <i>the new Prefect Cataphronius first appears. This</i> let loose the refuse of the heathen population as described, ib. 55-60. (7.) Hare the precise statement of the <i>Hist. Aceph.</i> fits in exactly. The Presbyters and people of Ath. remained in possession of the Churches until the arrival of the new Prefect, <i>with Count Heraclius,</i> on June 10. (8.) Heraclius is expressly called the <i>precursor</i> of George (p. 288) and is evidently sent to disarm the reported hostility of the (even heathen) public to the appointment. It may be added that if we are to take `probabilities' into account, it is easier to imagine a reason for a court nominee like George having been slow to take up a dangerous post, than for the Alexandrian chronologists of the day having invented a year's interval when none had existed. Montfaucon had already noticed that `a good deal must have happened' between the irruption of Syrianus and the entry of George. The data of Athanasius are for the first time clearly explained by the light thrown on them by the chroniclers. I should also have urged the fact that the commemoration of George's Pentecost Martyrs on May 21 in the Roman Martyrology <i>suits</i> 357 <i>and not</i> 356, had I succeeded in tracing the history of the entry, which has, however, so far eluded my efforts.</font></p>

<sup>74 </sup>We are quite in the dark as to when, and by whom, George was consecrated bishop. The statement of Sozomen iv. 8, that he was ordained by a council of thirty bishops at Antioch, including Theodore of Heraclea, who had died before the exile of Liberius in 355 (Thdt. <i>H.E.</i> ii. 16, p. 93. 13), is involved in too hopeless a tangle of anachronisms to be of any value for our enquiry. But that George was ordained in Antioch is in itself likely enough, and if so, his ordination would probably follow close upon the expulsion of Athanasius. But the repeated assurances of Ath. that George came <i>from court</i> would imply that after his ordination George went to Italy. That at once puts his arrival in Alxa. in Lent 356 out of the question.</p>

<sup>75 </sup>The statements of Ath. as to George are made at secondhand, and must be taken <i>cum grano.</i> He is `notoriously wealthy,' yet `hired' by the Arians. (Cf. p. 249; but apparently he combined wealth and avarice.) That he was `a heathen' is certainly untrue. His `ignorance' is equally so: we know that he was a well-read man and possessed a remarkably good library (D.C.B. ii. 638). That he had `the temper of a hangman' (p. 227) is in keeping with all that we know of him, and as to his general character, the statements of Athanasius and other churchmen are not stronger than Amm. Marcell. XXII. xi. 4 (cf. Gibbon, iii. 171 <i>sqq.,</i> ed. Smith, but correct his <i>jeu d'esprit</i> on `S. George and the Dragon' by Bright, in D.C.B. <i>ubi supra;</i> yet see Stanley, <i>Eastern Church,</i> Lect. vii. III..). </p>

<sup>76 </sup>p. 497. George was at Sirmium in the Spring of 359 (Soz. (v. 16). Paul <i>Catena</i> came to Alxa. from a similar commission at Scythopolis. He was apparently aided in both places by Modestus the Comes Orientis. From Liban. <i>Ep.</i> 205, we gather, to the credit of George, that he was the intermediary of requests for mitigation or some of the sentences. He was at this time at Antioch, from whence also `Ex Comitatu Principis,' Amm. XXII. xi., he returned to Alxa. in 361, evidently before he had heard of the Emperor's death.

<sup>78 </sup>Apparently it began with the quarrel over the election to the bishopric of Antioch, which Eudoxius managed to seize after the death of Leontius. George was aggrieved at his rights as an elector being ignored, and may have had hopes of the see for himself.

<sup>79 </sup>The discussions, reported with every appearance of substantial accuracy by Thdt. ii. 27, may have taken place at this time, or at the council of the succeeding month (Thdt. fails to distinguish the two meetings). Gwatkin, p. 180, appears to be right in adopting the former alternative, viz. that the party of Basil prudently abstained from attending a council in which they would be overpowered: cf. Soz. iv. 24, who however contradicts himself in the next chapter, <i>sub fin.</i> But the case is not quite clear. </p>

<sup>81 </sup>He states (1) That a rigorist party in the council were at first opposed to all conciliatory measures; this is highly probable, see Hieron. <i>adv. Lucif.</i> 20; (2) that former active Arians were to be admitted to lay communion only; this is not unlikely; (3) by implication, that Eusebius and Lucifer went first to Antioch, and agreed to take no step till after the Council which Eus. was to attend in person, and Luc. by deputy, at Alxa., but that Luc. broke his promise. This may contain a grain of truth, i.e. that Lucifer promised to do nothing before he heard from Alxa., but Eusebius can scarcely have gone to Antioch. I owe these notices to the excellent analysis of our sources of information in Krüger, <i>Lucif.</i> p. 46 <i>sq.;</i> but he makes an odd slip, p. 48, in saying that Soz. `schweigt von der Synode zu Alex. uberhaupt.'</p>

<sup>91 </sup>The reader is requested to supplement the necessarily very slender treatment of the Athanasian theology in this chapter by referring to the General Index to this volume, as well as to the Index of Texts, for guidance to the passages of Athanasius which are needed to check, fill out, and qualify what is here presented only in broad outline. </p>

<sup>92 </sup>The above is strikingly illustrated by the discussion (pp. 381-383) of <font face="SPIonic" size="6">prwtotokoj pashj ktisewj</font><font size="6"> (Col. i. 15). At first sight Ath. appears to contradict himself, explaining </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">prwtotokoj</font><font size="6"> as he does first solely of the Saviour as <i>Incarnate,</i> and then of the <i>cosmic</i> and <i>creative</i> function of the Word. But closer examination brings out his view of creation itself (p. 383) as an act of Grace, demanding not (as the current Eastern theology held, in common with Arius) the mediation of a subordinate Creator, but an act of absolutely Divine condescension analogous to, and anticipatory of, the Incarnation. The apparently disturbing persistence in the argument of the cosmological explanation of </font><font face="SPIonic">prwtotokoj</font><font size="6"> is really therefore due to a subtle change in it, by virtue of which it comes into relation with the Soteriological idea,-which is the pivot of the entire anti-Arian position of Athanasius on this question,-and with the ultimate scheme in which (cf. Rom. viii.) the effects of the Incarnation are to embrace the whole creation. Because creation as such involves the promise of adoption, and tends to deification as its goal, the Son is </font><font face="SPIonic">prwtotokoj</font><font size="6"> in the region of Grace and of Creation alike. </font></p>

<sup>95 </sup>The idea, of a mysterious unwritten tradition is a legacy ot Gnosticism to the Church. Irenaeus, in order to meet the Gnostic appeal to a supposed unwritten Apostolic tradition, confronts it with the consistency of the public and normal teaching of the Churches everywhere, of which the Roman Church is a convenient microcosm or compendium. The idea of a <font face="SPIonic" size="6">paradosij agrafoj</font><font size="6"> is adopted by Clement and Origen, and passes from the latter to Eusebius, and to the Cappadocian Fathers (Basil <i>de Sp. S.</i> 27, applies it only to <i>practical</i> details), Epiphanius, and later writers. Details in Harnack ii. 90, note, cf. Salmon, <i>Infallibility,</i> Lect. ix.

<sup>96 </sup>What is conspicuously true of the Second General Council is in reality not less true of the First. Its high authority to later ages is due not to its formal character as a council, but to the character of its work; the consent of the Church, and that not readily given, but as the result of a long process of searching and sifting, has given to it its `irreformable' authority. Its authority <i>is expressly put on a par with that of the Antiochene Synod</i> of <i>c.</i> 269, by Ath. <i>de Syn.</i> 43 (consult the whole discussion, pp. 473, 475, &amp;c.). Short of a council which should include every bishop of the entire Church, in unanimous agreement,-an impossible contingency,-the claims of any given council to be truly ecumenical are relative, not absolute; and no consistent theory is possible of the conditions under which a council could <i>by virtue of its constitution</i> claim infallibility for its decisions. The supposed infallibility of general councils lies in reality outside them, in the authority which sanctions and consecrates their decisions. According to the precedent of Nicaea this is the Church `diffusive' (cf. p. 489, and Pusey, <i>Councils,</i> p. 225, <i>sq.</i>), and such consent, again, must necessarily be partial and relative. If a more tangible and expeditious theory is wanted, we have it in the Roman system, according to which a council is infallible if ratified by the Pope. This at once puts all such councils, whether local or general, on one level, and affords a ready criterion. In other words, the only consistent (mechanical) theory of the infallibility of councils is one which makes councils superfluous. If such a theory had been known to the Church in the age of councils, the councils would not have been held. </p>

<sup>97 </sup>The doctrine of Athanasius is, not formally but none the less really, the doctrine of Chalcedon, which again stands or falls together with that of Nicaea. Like the latter, it transcends the power of human thought to do more than state it in terms which exclude the (Nestorian and Monophysite) alternatives. The Man Jesus Christ is held to have <i>lacked</i> nothing that constitutes personality in man; the human personality which therefore belongs to it <i>ideally,</i> being <i>in fact</i> merged in the Divine personality of the Son. The <i>`impersonality,'</i> as it is sometimes called, of Christ <i>qua</i> man is therefore better spoken of as His <i>Divine</i> Personality. Personality and will are correlated but not identical ideas. </p>

<sup>28 </sup>This explanation of gods as deified men is known as Euhemerism, from Euhemerus, who broached the theory in the third century, b.c. (<i>supra,</i> 10, note 1); but `there were Euhemerists in Greece before Euhemerus' (Jowett's Plato, 2. 101). The Fathers very commonly adopt the theory, for which, however, there are very slight grounds. Such cases as those of Antinous and the Emperors as well as the legends of heroes and demigods, gave it some plausibility (see Döllinger; <i>Gentile and Jew,</i> vol. i. p. 344. Eng. Tr.). </p>

<sup>36 </sup>This is in effect the defence of the `Scriptor de Mysteriis' (possibly Iamblichus, see Bernays `2 Abhandlungen' 1880, p. 37): material means of worship are a means of access directly to the lower (or quasi-material) gods, and so indirectly to the higher.

Fialon is certainly too imaginative (p. 86 contradicted p. 283), when he sees in the <i>contra Gentes</i> an appreciation of the higher religious principles which the modern science (`toute Francaise') of Egyptology has enabled us to read behind the grotesque features of popular Egyptian poly theism.</p>

<sup>2 </sup>And so infr. "most pious," §4. "most wise and most religious," ibid. "most religious," §8. §10. Eusebius observes in his <i>Vit. Const.</i> the same tone concerning Constantine, and assigns to him the same office in determining the faith (being as yet unbaptized), E.g. "When there were differences between persons of different countries, as if some common bishop appointed by God, he convened Councils of God's ministers; and not disdaining to be present and to sit amid their conferences," &amp;c. i. 44. When he came into the Nicene Council, "it was," says Eusebius, "as some heavenly Angel of God," iii. 10. alluding to the brilliancy of the imperial purple. He confesses, however, he diet not sit down until the Bishops bade him. Again at the same Council, "with pleasant eyes looking serenity itself into them all, collecting himself, and in a quiet and gentle voice" he made an oration to the Fathers upon peace. Constantine had been an instrument in conferring such vast benefits, humanly speaking, on the Christian Body, that it is not wonderful that other writers of the day besides Eusebius should praise him. Hilary speaks of him as "of sacred memory," <i>Fragm.</i> v. init. Athanasius calls him "most pious," <i>Apol. contr. Arian.</i> 9; "of blessed memory," <i>ad Ep. Aeg.</i> 18. 19. Epiphanius "most religious and of ever-blessed memory," <i>Haer.</i> 70. 9. Posterity, as was natural, was still more grateful.</p>

<sup>7 </sup>Eusebius does not commit himself to any positive sense in which the formula "of the essence" is to be interpreted, but only says what it does not mean. His comment on it is "of the Father, but not as a part;" where, what is not negative, instead of being an explanation, is but a recurrence to the original words of Scripture, of which <font face="SPIonic" size="6">ec ousiaj</font><font size="6"> itself is the explanation; a curious inversion. Indeed it is very doubtful whether be admitted the </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ec ousiaj</font><font size="6"> at all. He says, that the Son is not like the radiance of light so far as this, that the radiance is an inseparable accident of substance, whereas the Son is by the Father's will, </font><font face="SPIonic">kata gnwmhn kai proairesin</font><font size="6">, <i>Demonstr. Ev.</i> iv. 3. And though he insists on our Lord being <i>alone,</i> </font><font face="SPIonic">ek qeon</font><font size="6">, yet he means in the sense which Athan. refutes, supr. §6, viz. that He alone was created immediately from God, vid. next note 6. It is true that he plainly condemns with the Nicene Creed the </font><font face="SPIonic">ec ouk ontwn</font><font size="6"> of the Arians, "out of nothing," but an evasion was at hand here also; for he not only adds, according to Arian custom, "as others" (vid. note following) but he has a theory that no being whatever is out of nothing, for non-existence cannot be the cause of existence. God, he says, "proposed His own will and power as `a sort of matter and substance' of the production and constitution of the universe, so that it is not reasonably said, that any thing is out of nothing. For what is from nothing cannot be at all. How indeed can nothing be to any thing a cause of being? but at all that is, takes its being <i>from One</i> who only is, and was, who also said `I am that I am.'" <i>Demonstr. Ev.</i> iv. 1. Again, speaking of our Lord, "He who was from nothing would not truly be Son of God, `as neither is any other of things generate.'" <i>Eccl. Theol.</i> i. 9 fin. [see, however, D.C.B. ii. p. 347].</font></p>

<sup>8 </sup>Eusebius distinctly asserts, <i>Dem. Ev.</i> iv. 2, that our Lord is a creature. "This offspring," he says, "did He first produce Himself from Himself as a foundation of those things which should succeed, the perfect handy-work, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">dhmiourghma</font><font size="6">, of the Perfect, and the wise structure, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">arxitektonhma</font><font size="6">, of the Wise," &amp;c. Accordingly his avowal in the text is but the ordinary Arian evasion of "an offspring, not as the offsprings." E.g. "It is not without peril to say recklessly that the Son is originate out of nothing `similarly to the other things originate.'" <i>Dem Ev.</i> v. 1. vid. also <i>Eccl. Theol.</i> i. 9. iii. 2. And he considers our Lord the only Son by a divine provision similar to that by which there is only one sun in the firmament, as a <i>centre</i> of light and heat. "Such an Only-begotten Son, the excellent artificer of His will and operator, did the supreme God and Father of that operator Himself first of all beget, through Him and in Him giving subsistence to the operative words (ideas or causes) of things which were to be, and casting in Him the seeds of the constitution and governance of the universe;... Therefore the Father being One, it behoved the Son to be one also; but should any one object that He constituted not more, it is fitting for such a one to complain that He constituted not more suns, and moons, and worlds, and ten thousand other things." <i>Dem. Ev.</i> iv. 5 fin. vid. also iv. 6.</font></p>

<sup>9 </sup>Eusebius does not say that our Lord is "from the essence of" the Father, but has "an essence from" the Father. This is the Semi-arian doctrine, which, whether confessing the Son from the essence of the Father or not, implied that His essence was not the Father's essence, but a second essence. The same doctrine is found in the Semi-arians of Ancyra, though they seem to have confessed "of the essence." And this is one object of the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">omoousion</font><font size="6">, to hinder the confession "of the essence" from implying a second essence, which was not obviated or was even encouraged by the </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">omoiousion</font><font size="6">. The Council of Ancyra, quoting the text "As the Father hath life in Himself so," &amp;c., says, "since the life which is in the Father means essence, and the life of the Only-begotten which is begotten from the Father means essence, the word `so' implies a likeness of essence to essence." <i>Haer.</i> 73. 10 fin. Hence Eusebius does not scruple to speak of "two essences," and other writers of three essences, <i>contr. Marc.</i> i. 4. p. 25. He calls our Lord "a second essence." <i>Dem. Ev.</i> vi. <i>Praef. Praep. Ev.</i> vii. 12. p. 320, and the Holy Spirit a third essence, ibid. 15. p. 325. This it was that made the Latins so suspicions of three hypostases, because the Semi-arians, as well as they, understood </font><font face="SPIonic">upostasij</font><font size="6"> to mean essence [but this is dubious]. Eusebius in like manner [after Origen] calls our Lord "another God," "a second God." <i>Dem. Ev.</i> v. 4. p. 226. v. fin. "second Lord." ibid. 3 init. 6. fin. "second cause." <i>Dem. Ev.</i> v. Pr...f. vid. also </font><font face="SPIonic">eteron exousa to kat ousian upokeimenon</font><font size="6"> <i>Dem. Ev.</i> v. 1. p. 215. </font><font face="SPIonic">kaq eauton ousiwmenoz</font><font size="6"> ibid. iv. 3. And so </font><font face="SPIonic">eteroj para ton patira</font><font size="6">. <i>Eccl.

Hence Athan. insists so much, as in <i>de Decr.,</i> on our Lord <i>not</i> being external to the Father. Once admit that He is in the Father, and we may call the Father, the <i>only</i> God, for He is included. And so again as to the Ingenerate, the term does not exclude the Son, for He is generate in the Ingenerate.</font></p>

<sup>11 </sup>Here again Eusebius does not say "from the Father's essence," but "not from other essence, but from the Father." According to note 5, supr. be considered the will of God a certain matter or substance. Montfaucon in loc. and <i>Collect. Nov.</i> Praef. p. xxvi. translates without warrant "ex Patris hypostasi et substantiâ." As to the Son's perfect likeness to the Father which he seems here to grant, it has been already shewn, <i>de Decr.</i> 20, note 9, how the admission was evaded. The likeness was but a likeness after its own kind, as a picture is of the original. "Though our Saviour Himself teaches," he says, "that the Father is the `only true God,' still let me not be backward to confess Him also the true God, `as in an image,' and that possessed; so that the addition of `only' may belong to the Father alone as archetype of the image ...As, supposing one king held sway, and his image was carried about into every quarter, no one in his right mind would say that those who held sway were two, but one who was honoured through his image; in like manner," &amp;c. <i>de Eccles. Theol. ii. 23</i>, vid. <i>ibid.</i> 7.</p>

<sup>13 </sup>Socrates, who advocates the orthodoxy of Eusebius, leaves out this heterodox paragraph [§§9, 10] altogether. Bull, however, <i>Defens. F. N.</i> iii. 9. n. 3. thinks it an interpolation. Athanasius alludes to the early part of the clause, supr. §4. and <i>de Syn.</i> §13. where he says, that Eusebius implied that the Arians denied even our Lord's existence before His incarnation. As to Constantine, he seems to have been used on these occasions by the court Bishops who were his instructors, and who made him the organ of their own heresy. Upon the first rise of the Arian controversy he addressed a sort of pastoral letter to Alexander and Arius, telling them that they were disputing about a question of words, and recommending them to drop it and live together peaceably. Euseb. <i>vit. C.</i> ii. 69. 72.</p>

<sup>14 </sup>[Rather `potentially' both here and three lines below.] Theognis, [one] of the Nicene Arians, says the same, according to Philostorgius; viz. "that God even before He begat the Son was a Father, as having the power, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">dunamij</font><font size="6">, of begetting." <i>Hist.</i> ii. 15. Though Bull pronounces such doctrine to be heretical, as of course it is, still he considers that it expresses what <i>otherwise</i> stated may be orthodox, viz. the doctrine that our Lord was called the Word from eternity, and the Son upon His descent to create the worlds. And he acutely and ingeniously interprets the Arian formula, "Before His generation He was not," to support this view. Another opportunity will occur of giving an opinion upon this question; meanwhile, the <i>parallel</i> on which the heretical doctrine is supported in the text is answered by many writers, on the ground that Father and Son are words of nature, but Creator, King, Saviour, are external, or what may be called accidental to Him. Thus Athanasius observes, that Father actually implies Son, but Creator only the power to create, as expressing a </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">dunamij</font><font size="6">; "a maker is before his works, but he who says Father, forthwith in Father implies the existence of the Son." Orat. iii. §6. vid. Cyril too, <i>Dial.</i> ii. p. 459. Pseudo-Basil, <i>contr. Eun.</i> iv. 1. fin. On the other hand Origen argues the reverse way, that since God is eternally a Father, therefore eternally Creator also: "As one cannot he father without a son nor lord without possession, so neither can God be ca ed All-powerful, without subjects of His power;" <i>de Princ.</i> i. 2. n. 10. hence he argued for the eternity of matter. </font></p>

<sup>2 </sup>This dramatic representation of the Mission of the Son stands alone in the writings of Athanasius, and, if pressed, lends itself to a conception of the relation of the Son to the Father which, if not Arian, is at least contrary to the more explicit and mature conception of Athanasius as formulated for example in <i>Orat. ii. 31</i> (and see note 7 there). The same idea appears in Milton's Paradise Lost (e.g. Book X.) See Newman, <i>Arians</i> 4, p. 93, note. </p>

<sup>16 </sup>The Eusebians alleged that, fifty-four Bishops of the two parties of S. Alexander and Meletius being assembled for the election, and having sworn to elect by the common voice, six or seven of these broke their oaths in favour of S. Athanasius, whom no one had thought of, and consecrated him in secret to the great surprise and scandal of both ecclesiastical and lay persons. vid. Socr. ii. 17. Philostorgius (a.d. 425) adds particulars, explanatory or corrective of this statement, of which the Bishops in the text do not seem to have heard; viz., that Athanasius with his party one night seized on the Church of St. Dionysius, and compelled two Bishops whom he found there to consecrate him against their will; that he was in consequence anathematized by all the other Bishops, but that, fortifying himself in his position, he sent in his election to the Emperor, and by this means obtained its confirmation. <i>H. E.</i> ii. 16. It appears, in matter of fact, that S. Athan. was absent at time of his election; as Socrates says, in order to avoid it, or as Epiphanius, on business at the Court; these reasons are compatible. [Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §4, and Gwatkin's note, quoted there.]</p>

<sup>31 </sup>The circumstances of this appeal, which are related by Athan. below, §86, are thus summed up by Gibbon; "Before the final sentence could be pronounced at Tyre, the intrepid primate threw himself into a bark which was ready to hoist sail for the imperial city. The request of a formal audience might have been opposed or eluded; but Athanasius concealed his arrival, watched the moment of Constantine's return from an adjacent villa, and boldly encountered his angry sovereign as he passed on horseback through the principal street of Constantinople. So strange an apparition excited his surprise and indignation; and the guards were ordered to remove the importunate suitor; but his resentment was subdued by involuntary respect; and the haughty spirit of the Emperor was awed by the courage and eloquence of a Bishop, who implored his justice and awakened his conscience." <i>Decl. and Fail,</i> xxi.

<sup>34 </sup>This period, when Christianity was acknowledged by the state but not embraced by the population, is just the time when we hear most of this Reserve as a principle.

According to the Eusebians at Philippopolis, they had deposed him [17 years previously, but the number must be corrupt, or the statement incorrect]. They state, however, at the same time, that he had been condemned by Athanasius and Marcellus, vid. Hilar. <i>Fragm.</i> iii. 13. Sozomen, <i>Hist.</i> iii. 8. says that they deposed him on the charge of having overturned an altar; and, after Athan. <i>infr.</i> §47, that he was acquitted at Sardica on the ground that Eusebius of Caesarea and others had reinstated him in his see (before 339).

Newman explains that they treat Julius as `a superior,' Athanasius as `an equal;' but surely he was something more than an equal. Fear of Constans, and the desire to secure themselves from attack, would make it importer for them at any price to obtain the favour of the first bishop of the West. In order to do this they had to make their peace with Athanasius; but in doing so, they went no further than they could help.] </p>

<sup>26 </sup>On the "cursus publicus," vid. Gothofred. <i>in Cod. Theod.</i> viii. tit. 5. It was provided for the journeys of the Emperor, for persons whom he summoned, for magistrates, ambassadors, and for such private persons as the Emperor indulged in the use of it, which was gratis. The use was granted by Constantine to the Bishops who were summoned to Nicaea, as far as it went, in addition (though aliter Valesius in loc.) to other means of travelling. Euseb. <i>v. Const.</i> iii. 6. The cursus publicus brought the Bishops to the Council of Tyre. <i>ibid.</i> iv. 43. In the conference between Liberius and Constantius, Theod. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 13. it is objected that the cursus publicus is not sufficient to convey Bishops to the Council which Liberius proposes; he answers that the Churches are rich enough to convey their Bishops as far as the sea. Thus S. Hilary was compelled (data evectionis copia, Sulp. Sev. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 57.) to attend at Seleucia, as Athan. at Tyre. Julian complains of the abuse of the cursus publicus, perhaps with an allusion to these Councils of Constantius. vid. <i>Cod. Theod.</i> viii. tit. 5. 1. 12. where Gothofred quotes Liban. <i>Epitaph. in Julian.</i> vol. i. p. 569. ed. Reiske.)

Hilar. <i>Frag.</i> iii. 25. The Emperor provided board and perhaps lodging for the Bishops at Ariminum; which the Bishops of Aquitaine, Gaul, and Britain, declined, except three British from poverty. Sulp. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 56.

The express object of the second part was to prove, what has now been proved by documents, that Valens and Ursacius did but succumb to plain facts which they could not resist.

Theodor. Hist. i. 4. "Atheism" and "Atheist" imply intention, system, and profession, and are so far too strong a rendering of the Greek. Since Christ was God, to deny Him was to deny God. The force of the term, however, seems to be, that, whereas the Son had revealed the "unknown God," and destroyed the reign of idols, the denial of the Son was bringing back idolatry and its attendant spiritual ignorance. Thus <i>contr. Gent.</i> §29. fin. he speaks of "the Greek idolatry as full of all Atheism" or ungodliness, and contrasts with it the knowledge of "the Guide and Framer of the Universe, the Father's Word," "that through Him `we may discern His Father,' and the Greeks may know `how far they have separated themselves from the truth.'" And <i>Orat.</i> ii. 43. he classes Arians with the Greeks, who "though they have the name of God in their mouths, incur the charge of `Atheism,' because they know not the real and true God, `the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.'" (vid. also Basil in <i>Eunom.</i> ii. 22.) Shortly afterwards he gives a further reason for the title, observing that Arianism was worse than previous heresies, such as Manicheism, inasmuch as the latter denied the Incarnation, but Arianism tore from God's substance His connatural Word, and, as far as its words went, infringed upon the perfections and being of the first Cause. And so ad <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> §17. fin. he says, that it alone, beyond other heresies, "has been bold against the Godhead Itself in a mad way (</font><font face="SPIonic">manikwteron</font><font size="6">, vid. foregoing note), denying that there is a Word, and that the Father was always Father." Elsewhere he speaks more generally, as if Arianism introduced "an Atheism or rather Judaism `against the Scriptures,' being next door to Heathenism, so that its disciple cannot be even named Christian; for all such tenets are `contrary to the Scriptures;'" and he makes this the reason why the Nicene Fathers stopped their ears and condemned it. ad <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> §13. For the same reason he calls the heathen </font><font face="SPIonic">aqeoi</font><font size="6">, atheistical or ungodly, "who are arraigned of irreligion by Divine Scripture." <i>contr. Gent.</i> §14. vid. </font><font face="SPIonic">eidwlwn aqeothta</font><font size="6">. §46. init. Moreover, he calls the Arian persecution worse than the pagan `cruelties,' and therefore "a Babylonian Atheism," <i>Ep. Encycl.</i> §5. as not allowing the Catholics the use of prayer and baptism, with a reference to Dan. vi. 11, &amp;c. Thus too he calls Constantius at heist, for his treatment of Hosius; </font><font face="SPIonic">oute ton qeon fobhqeij o aqeoj</font><font size="6">. <i>Hist. Arian.</i> 45. Another reason for the title seems to have lain in the idolatrous character of Arian worship `on its own shewing,' viz. as worshipping One whom they yet maintained to be a creature.

Athan. says that the Arians must not criticise the latter before they had cleared themselves of the former. Thus he says presently, that they were at once irreligious in their faith and ignorant in their criticism; and speaks of the Council negativing their formulae, and substituting those which were "sound and ecclesiastical." vid. also n. 4.</p>

<sup>33 </sup>Vid. Orat. i. §38. The controversy turned on the question what was meant by the word `Son.' Though the Arians would not allow with the Catholics that our Lord was Son <i>by nature,</i> and maintained that the word implied <i>a beginning of existence,</i> they did not dare to say that He was Son merely in the sense in which we are sons, though, as Athan. contends, they necessarily tended to this conclusion, directly they receded from the Catholic view. Thus Arius said that He was a creature, `but not as one of the creatures.' <i>Orat.</i> ii. §19. Valens at Ariminum said the same, Jerom. adv. Lucifer. 18. Hilary says, that not daring directly to deny that He was God, the Arians merely asked `whether He was a Son.' <i>de Trin.</i> viii. 3. Athanasius remarks upon this reluctance to speak out, challenging them to present `the heresy naked,' <i>de Sent. Dionys.</i> 2. init. `No one,' he says elsewhere, `puts a light under a bushel; let them shew the world their heresy naked.' <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> 18. vid. ibid. 10.

Epiphanius <i>Haer.</i> 76 p. 949. seems to say that the elder Arians held the divine generation in a sense in which Aetius did not, that is, they were not so consistent and definite as he. Athan. goes on to mention some of the attempts of the Arians to find some theory short of orthodoxy, yet short of that extreme heresy, on the other hand, which they felt ashamed to avow.</font></p>

<sup>59 </sup>His argument is, that if the Son but partook the Father in the sense in which we partake the Son, then the Son would not impart to us the Father, but Himself, and would be a separating as well as uniting medium between the Father and us; whereas He brings us so near to the Father, that we are the Father's children, not His, and therefore He must be Himself one with the Father, or the Father must be in Him with an incomprehensible completeness. vid. <i>de Synod.</i> §51. <i>contr. Gent.</i> 46. fin. Hence S. Augustin says, `As the Father has life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself, <i>not by participating,</i> but in Himself. For we have not life in ourselves, but in our God. But that Father, who has life in Himself, begat a Son such, as to have life in Himself, not to become partaker of life, but <i>to be Himself life; and of that life to make us partakers.</i> Serm. 127. de Verb.

<sup>68 </sup>One of the characteristic points in Athanasius is his constant attention to the <i>sense</i> of doctrine, or the <i>meaning</i> of writers, in preference to the words used. Thus he scarcely uses the symbol <font face="SPIonic" size="6">omoousion</font><font size="6">, one in substance, throughout his <i>Orations,</i> and in the <i>de Synod.</i> acknowledges the Semiarians as brethren. Hence infr. §18. he says, that orthodox doctrine `is revered by all though expressed in strange language, provided the speaker means religiously, and wishes to convey by it a religious sense.' vid. also §21. He says, that Catholics are able to `speak freely,' or to expatiate, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">parrhsiazomeqa</font><font size="6">, `out of Divine Scripture.' <i>Orat.</i>i §9. §9. vid. <i>de Sent. Dionys.</i> §20. init. Again: `The devil spoke from Scripture, but was silenced by the Saviour; Paul spoke from profane writers, yet, being a saint, he has a religious meaning.' <i>de Syn.</i> §39, also ad <i>Ep. ¦g.</i> 8. Again, speaking of the apparent contrariety between two Councils, `It were unseemly to make the one conflict with the other, for all their members are fathers; and it were profane to decide that these spoke well and those ill, for all of them have slept in Christ.' §43. also §47. Again: `Not the phrase, but the meaning and the religious life, is the recommendation of the faithful.' ad <i>Ep. ¦g.</i> §9.</font></p>

<sup>70 </sup>Vid. also <i>Incarn.</i> §17. This contrast is not commonly found in ecclesiastical writers, who are used to say that God is present everywhere, in substance as well as by energy or power. S. Clement, however, expresses himself still more strongly in the same way, `In substance far off (for how can the originate come close to the Unoriginate?), but most close in power, in which the universe is embosomed.' <i>Strom. 2. circ. init.</i> but the parenthesis explains his meaning. Vid. Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> 6. p. 44. The common doctrine of the Fathers is, that God is present everywhere in <i>substance.</i> Vid. Petav. <i>de Deo,</i> iii. 8. and 9. It may be remarked, that S.

<sup>71 </sup>6 In Almighty God is the perfection and first pattern of what is seen in shadow in human nature, according to the imperfection of the subject matter; and this remark applies, as to creation, so to generation. Athanasius is led to state this more distinctly in another connection in <i>Orat.</i> i. §21. fin. `It belongs to the Godhead alone, <i>that the Father is properly</i> (<font face="SPIonic" size="6">kuriwj</font><font size="6">) <i>Father, and the Son properly</i> (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">kuriwj</font><font size="6">) <i>Son;</i> and in Them and Them only does it hold that the Father is ever Father, and the Son ever Son.' Accordingly he proceeds, shortly afterwards, as in the text, to argue, `<i>For God does not make men His pattern,</i> but rather we men, for that God <i>is properly</i> and alone truly Father of His own Son, are also called fathers of our own children, for "of Him is every father-hood in heaven and on earth named,"' §23. The Semiarians at Ancyra quote the same text for the same doctrine. Epiphan. <i>Haer.</i> 73. 5. As do Cyril in <i>Joan.</i> i. p. 24. <i>Thesaur.</i> 32. p. 281. and Damascene <i>de Fid. Orth.</i> i. 8. The same parallel, as existing between creation and generation is insisted on by Isidor. Pel. <i>Ep.</i> iii. 355. Basil <i>contr. Eun.</i> iv. p. 280 A., Cyril <i>Thesaur.</i> 6. p. 43. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 69. 36. and Gregor.

<sup>133 </sup>By <font face="SPIonic" size="6">aiwn</font><font size="6">, age, seems to be meant duration, or the measure of duration, before or independent of the existence of motion, which is in measure of time. As motion, and therefore time, are creatures, so are the ages. Considered as the measure of duration, an age has a sort of positive existence, though not an </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ousia</font><font size="6"> or substance, and means the same as `world,' or an existing system of things viewed apart from time and motion. Vid. Theod. in Hebr. i. 2. Our Lord then is the Maker of the ages thus considered, as the Apostle also tells us, Hebr. xi. 3. and God is the King of the ages, Tim. 1. 17. or is before all ages, as being eternal, or </font><font face="SPIonic">proaiwnioj</font><font size="6">. However, sometimes the word is synonymous with eternity; `as time is to things which are under time, so ages to things which are everlasting.' Damasc. <i>Fid. Orth.</i> ii. 1, and `ages of ages' stands for eternity; and then the `ages' or measures of duration may be supposed to stand for the </font><font face="SPIonic">ideai</font><font size="6"> or ideas in the Divine Mind, which seems to have been a Platonic or Gnostic notion. Hence Synesius, <i>Hymn</i> iii. addresses the Almighty as </font><font face="SPIonic">aiwnotoke</font><font size="6">, parent of the ages. Hence sometimes God Himself is called the Age, Ciera. Alex. <i>Hymn. Poed.</i> iii. fin. or, the Age of ages, Pseudo-Dion. <i>de Div. Nom.</i> 5. p. 580. or again, </font><font face="SPIonic">aiwnioj</font><font size="6">. Theodoret sums up what has been said thus: `Age is not any subsisting substance, but is an interval indicative of time, now infinite, when God is spoken of, now commensurate with creation, now with human life.' <i>Hoer.</i> v. 6. If then, as Athan. says in the text, the Word is Maker of the ages, He is independent of duration altogether; He does not come to be in time, but is above and beyond it, or eternal. Elsewhere he says, 'The words addressed to the Son in the 144th Psalm, `Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages,' forbid any one to imagine any interval at all in which the Word did not exist. For if every interval is measured by ages, and of all the ages the Word is King and Maker, therefore, whereas no interval at all exists prior to Him, it were madness to say, "There was once when the Everlasting (</font><font face="SPIonic">aiwnioj</font><font size="6">) was not." <i>Orat.</i> i. 12. And so Alexander; `Is it not unreasonable that He who made times, and ages, and seasons, to all of which belongs `was not,' should be said not to be? for, if so, that interval in which they say the Son was not yet begotten by the Father, precedes that Wisdom of God which framed <i>all</i> things.' Theod. <i>Hist.</i> i. 4. vid also Basil <i>de Sp. S.</i> n. 14. Hilar. <i>de Trin.</i> xii. 34.</font></p>

<sup>141 </sup>Hence it stands in the Creed, `from the Father, <i>that is,</i> from the essence of the Father.' vid. Eusebius's Letter, infr. According to the received doctrine of the Church all rational beings, and in one sense all beings whatever, are `from God,' over and above the fact of their creation; and of this truth the Arians made use to deny our Lord's proper divinity. Athan. lays down elsewhere that nothing remains in consistence and life, except from a participation of the Word, which is to be considered a gift from Him, additional to that of creation, and separable in idea from it; vid. above, §17, note <i>contr. Gent.</i> 42. <i>de Incarn.</i> 5. Man thus considered is, in his first estate, a son of God and born of God, or, to use the term which occurs so frequently in the Arian controversy, in the number, not only of the creatures, but of <i>things generate,</i> <font face="SPIonic" size="6">gennhta</font><font size="6">. This was the sense in which the Arians said that our Lord was Son of God; whereas, as Athan. says, `things originate, <i>being works,</i> cannot be called generate, except so far as, after their making, they partake of the begotten Son, and are therefore said to have been generated also; not at all in their own nature, but because of their participation of the Son in the Spirit.' <i>Orat.</i> i. 56. The question then was, as to the <i>distinction</i> of the Son's divine generation over that of holy men; and the Catholics answered that He was </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ec ousiaj</font><font size="6">, from the essence of God; not by participation of grace, not by resemblance, not in a limited sense, but really and simply, and therefore by an internal divine act. vid. below, §22. and <i>infr.</i> §31.

<sup>144 </sup>When characteristic attributes and prerogatives are ascribed to God, or to the Father, this is done only to the exclusion of creatures, or of false gods, not to the exclusion of His Son who is implied in the mention of Himself. Thus when God is called only wise, or the Father the only God, or God is said to be unoriginate, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">agenhoj</font><font size="6">, this is not in contrast to the Son, but to all things which are distinct from God vid. <i>Orat.</i> iii. 8. Naz. <i>Orat.</i> 30, 13. Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> p 142. `The words "one" and "only" ascribed to God in Scripture,' says S. Basil, `are not used in contrast to the Son or the Holy Spirit, but with reference to those who are not God, and falsely called so.' <i>Ep.</i> 8. n. 3. Oil the other hand, when the Father is mentioned, the other Divine Persons are implied in Him, `The Blessed and Holy Trinity,' says S. Athan. `is indivisible and one in itself; and when the Father is mentioned, His Word is added, and the Spirit in the Son; and if the Son is named, in the Son is the Father, and the Spirit is not external to the Word.' <i>ad Serap.</i> i. 14.</font></p>

Tert. in <i>Hermog,</i> 3.), nay, it expressly meant to negative the contrary notion of the Arians, that our Lord was from something distinct from God, and in consequence of created substance. moreover the term expresses the idea of God <i>positively,</i> in contradistinction to negative epithets, such as infinite, immense, eternal, &amp;c. Damasc. <i>Fid. Orthod.</i> i. 4. and as little implies any thing distinct from God as those epithets do.</font></p>

<sup>157 </sup>The Arians allowed that our Lord was like and tile image of the Father, but in the sense in which a picture is like the original, differing from it in substance and in fact. In this sense they even allowed the strong word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">aparallaktoj</font><font size="6"> <i>unvarying</i>[or rather <i>exact</i>] image, vid. beginning of §20. which had been used by the Catholics (vid. Alexander, ap.

Even this strong phrase, however, </font><font face="SPIonic">kat' ousian aparallaktoj eikwn</font><font size="6">, or </font><font face="SPIonic">aparallaktwj omoioj</font><font size="6">, did not appear to the Council an adequate safeguard of the doctrine.

Yet Basil, <i>contr. Eunom.</i> ii. 6-8. explicitly disavows the word, as an unscriptural invention of Eunomius. `That the Father begat we are taught in many places: that the Son is offspring we never heard up to this day, for Scripture says, "unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given."' c. 7. He goes on to say that `it is fearful to give Him names of our own to whom God has given a name which is above every name;' and observes that offspring is not the word which even a human father would apply to his son, as for instance we read, `Child, (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">teknon</font><font size="6">,) go into the vineyard,' and `Who art thou, my son?' moreover that fruits of the earth are called offspring (`I will not drink of the offspring of this vine'), rarely animated things, except indeed in such instances as, `O generation (offspring) of vipers.' Nyssen defends his brother, <i>contr. Eunom. Orat.</i> iii. p 105. In the Arian formula `an offspring, but not as <i>one of the offsprings,</i>' it is synonymous with `work' or `creature.' On the other hand Epiphanius uses it, e.g. Hoer. 76. n. 8. and Naz. <i>Orat.</i> 29. n. 2. Eusebius, <i>Demonstr. Ev.</i> iv. 2. Pseudo-Basil. <i>adv. Eunom.</i> iv. p. 280. fin.</font></p>

<sup>167 </sup><font face="SPIonic" size="6">sumbebhkoj</font><font size="6">. Cf. <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2. also <i>Orat.</i> i. 36. The text embodies the common doctrine of the Fathers. Athenagoras, however, speaks of God's goodness as an accident, `as colour to the body,' `as flame is ruddy and the sky blue,' <i>Legat.</i> 24. This, however is but a verbal difference, for shortly before he speaks of His being, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">to ontwj on</font><font size="6">, and His unity of nature, </font><font face="SPIonic">to monofuej</font><font size="6">, as in the number of </font><font face="SPIonic">episumbebhkota autw</font><font size="6">. Eusebius uses the word </font><font face="SPIonic">sumbebhkoj</font><font size="6"> in the same way [but see <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2, note 8], Demonstr. <i>Evang.</i> iv. 3. And hence S. Cyril, in controversy with the Arians, is led by the course of their objections to observe. `There are cogent reasons for considering these things <i>as accidents</i> </font><font face="SPIonic">sombebhkota</font><font size="6"> in God, though they be not.' <i>Thesaur.</i> p. 263. vid. the following note.</font></p>

<sup>168 </sup><font face="SPIonic" size="6">peribolh</font><font size="6">, and so <i>de Syn.</i> §34. which is very much the same passage. Some Fathers, however, seem to say the reverse. E.g. Nazianzen says that `neither the immateriality of God nor ingenerateness, present to us His essence.' <i>Orat.</i> 28. 9. And S. Augustine, arguing on the word ingenitus, says, that `not every thing which is said to be in God is said according to essence.' <i>de Trin.</i> v. 6. And hence, while Athan. in the text denies that there are qualities or the like belonging to Him, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">peri auton</font><font size="6">, it is still common in the Fathers to speak of qualities, as in the passage of S. Gregory just cited, in which the words </font><font face="SPIonic">peri qeon</font><font size="6"> occur. There is no difficulty in reconciling these statements, though it would require more words than could be given to it here. Petavius has treated the subject fully in his work <i>de Deo.</i> i. 7-11. and especially ii. 3. When the Fathers say that there is no difference between the divine `proprietates' and essence, they speak of the fact, considering the Almighty as He is; when they affirm a difference, they speak of Him as contemplated by us, who are unable to grasp the idea of Him as one and simple, but view His Divine Nature as if <i>in projection</i> (if such a word may be used), and thus divided into substance and quality as man may be divided into genus and difference.</font></p>

<sup>171 </sup>Athan.'s ordinary illustration is, as here, not from `fire,' but from `radiance,' <font face="SPIonic" size="6">apaugasma</font><font size="6">, after S. Paul [i.e. Hebrews[ and the Author of the Book of Wisdom, meaning by radiance the light which a light diffuses by means of the atmosphere. On the other hand Arius in his letter to Alexander, Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 69. 7. speaks against the doctrine of Hieracas that the Son was from the Father as a light from a light or as a lamp divided into two, which after all was Arian doctrine. Athanasius refers to fire, <i>Orat.</i> iv. §2 and 10, but still to fire and its radiance. However we find the illustration of fire from fire, Justin. <i>Tryph.</i> 61. Tatian <i>contr. Groec.</i> 5. At this early day the illustration of radiance might have a Sabellian bearing, as that of fire in Athan.'s had an Arian. Hence Justin protests against those who considered the Son as `like the sun's light in the heaven,' which `when it sets, goes away with it,' whereas it is as `fire kindled from fire.' Tryph. 128. Athenagoras, however, like Athanasius, says `as light from fire,' using also the word </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">aporroia</font><font size="6">, effluence: vid. also Orig. <i>Periarch.</i> i. 2. n. 4.

<sup>176 </sup>The point in which perhaps all the ancient heresies concerning our Lord's divine nature agreed, was in considering His different titles to be those of different beings or subjects, or not really and properly to belong to one and the same person; so that the Word was not the Son, or the Radiance not the Word, or our Lord was the Son, but only improperly the Word, not the true Word, Wisdom, or Radiance. Paul of Samosata, Sabellius [?], and Arius, agreed in considering that the Son was a creature, and that He was called, made after, or inhabited by the impersonal attribute called the Word or Wisdom. When the Word or Wisdom was held to be personal, it became the doctrine of Nestorius.</p>

<sup>177 </sup>Athanasius elsewhere calls him `the admirable and excellent.' <i>ad Serap.</i> iv. 9. He was Master of the Catechetical school of Alexandria towards the end of the third century, being a scholar, or at least a follower of Origen. His seven books of Hypotyposes treated of the Holy Trinity, of angels, and evil spirits, of the Incarnation, and the Creation. Photius, who gives this account, Cod. 106, accuses him of heterodoxy on these points; which Athanasius in a measure admits, as far as the wording of his treatise went, when he speaks of his `investigating by way of exercise.' Eusebius does not mention him at all. [His remains in Routh, <i>Rell.</i> iii. 409-414.] </p>

<sup>180 </sup>It is sometimes erroneously supposed that such illustrations as this are intended to <i>explain</i> how the Sacred Mystery in question is possible, whereas they are merely intended to shew that the words we use concerning it are not <i>self-contradictory,</i> which is the objection most commonly brought against them. To say that the doctrine of the Son's generation does not intrench upon the Father's perfection and immutability, or negative the Son's eternity, seems at first sight inconsistent with what the words Father and Son mean, till another image is adduced, such as the sun and radiance, in which that alleged inconsistency is seen to exist in fact. Here one image corrects another; and the accumulation of images is not, as is often thought, the restless and fruitless effort of the mind to <i>enter into the Mystery,</i> but is a <i>safeguard</i> against any one image, nay, any collection of images being supposed <i>sufficient.</i> If it be said that the language used concerning the sun and its radiance is but popular not philosophical, so again the Catholic language concerning the Holy Trinity may, nay must be, economical, not adequate, conveying the truth. not in the tongues of angels, but under human modes of thought and speech.</p>

<sup>183 </sup>By the Monarchy is meant the doctrine that the Second and Third Persons in the Ever-blessed Trinity are ever to be referred in our thoughts to the First as the Fountain of Godhead, vid. §15. note 9, and §19, note 6. It is one of the especial senses in which God is said to be one. Cf. Orat. iii. §15. vid. also iv. §1. `The Father is <i>union,</i> <font face="SPIonic" size="6">enwsin</font><font size="6">,' says S. Greg. Naz. `from whom and unto whom are the others.' Orat 42. 15. also Orat. 20. 7. and Epiph. Hoer. 57. 5. Tertullian, before Dionysius, uses the word Monarchia, which Praxeas had perverted into a kind of Unitarianism or Sabellianism, in <i>Prax.</i> 3. Irenaeus too wrote on the Monarchy, i.e. against the doctrine that God is the author of evil. Eus. <i>Hist.</i> v. 20. [see S. Iren. <i>fragment</i> 33, Ante-Nic. Lib.] And before him was Justin's work <i>de Monarchia,</i> where the word is used in opposition to Polytheism. The Marcionites, whom Dionysius presently mentions, are also specified in the above extract by Athan. vid. also Cyril. <i>Hier. Cat.</i> xvi. 3. Epiphanius says that their three origins were God, the Creator, and the evil spirit. Hoer. 42, 3. or as Augustine says, the good, the just, and the wicked, which may be taken to mean nearly the same thing. Hoer. 22.

<sup>186 </sup>The word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">triaj</font><font size="6">, usually translated Trinity, is first used by Theophilus, <i>ad Autol.</i> ii. 15. Gibbon remarks that the doctrine of `a numerical rather than a generical unity,' which has been explicitly put forth by the Latin Church, is favoured by the Latin language; </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">triaj</font><font size="6"> seems to excite the idea of substance, <i>trinitas</i> of qualities.' ch. 21. note 74. It is certain that the Latin view of the sacred truth, when perverted, becomes Sabellianism; and that the Greek, when perverted, becomes Arianism; and we find Arius arising in the East, Sabellius in the West. It is also certain that the word Trinitas is properly abstract; and expresses </font><font face="SPIonic">triaj</font><font size="6"> or `a three,' only in an ecclesiastical sense. But Gibbon does not seem to observe that Unitas is abstract as well as Trinitas; and that we might just as well say in consequence, that the Latins held an abstract unity or a unity of qualities, while the Greeks by </font><font face="SPIonic">monaj</font><font size="6"> taught the doctrine of `a one' or a numerical unity. `Singularitatem hanc dico (says S. Ambrose), quod Graece </font><font face="SPIonic">monothj</font><font size="6"> dicitur; singularitas ad personam pertinet, unitas ad naturam.' <i>de Fid.</i> v. 1. It is important, however, to understand, that `Trinity' does not mean the <i>state</i> or <i>condition</i> of being three, as humanity is the condition of being man, but is synonymous with <i>three persons.</i> Humanity does not exist and cannot be addressed, but the Holy Trinity is a three, or a unity which exists in three. Apparently from not considering this, Luther and Calvin objected to the word Trinity, `It is a common prayer,' says Calvin: `Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us. It displeases me, and savours throughout of barbarism.' <i>Ep. ad Polon.</i> p. 796.</font></p>

<sup>194 </sup>This extract discloses to us (in connexion with the passages from Dionysius Alex. here and in the <i>de Sent. D.</i>) a remarkable anticipation of the Arian controversy in the third century. 1. It appears that the very symbol of <font face="SPIonic" size="6">hn ote ouk hn</font><font size="6">, `once He was not,' was asserted or implied; vid. also the following extract from Origen, §27. and Origen <i>Periarchon,</i> iv. 28. where mention is also made of the </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ec ouk ontwn</font><font size="6">, `out of nothing,' which was the Arian symbol in opposition to `of the substance.' Allusions are made besides, to `the Father not being always Father,' <i>de Sent. D.</i> 15. and `the Word being brought to be by the true Word, and Wisdom by the true Wisdom;' ibid. 25. 2. The same special text is used in defence of the heresy, and that not at first sight an obvious one, which is found among the Arians, Prov. viii. 22. 3. The same texts were used by the Carbolics, which occur in the Arian controversy. e.g. Deut. xxxii. 6. against Prov. viii. 22. and such as Ps. cx. 3. Prov. viii. 25. and the two John x. 30. John xiv. 10. 4. The same Catholic symbols and statements are found, e.g. `begotten not made,' `one in essence,' `Trinity,' </font><font face="SPIonic">adiaireton, anarxon, aeigenej</font><font size="6">, `light from light,' &amp;c. Much might be said on this circumstance, as forming part of the proof of the very early date of the development and formation of the Catholic theology, which we are at first sight apt to ascribe to the 4th and 5th centuries.

<sup>199 </sup>The profession under which the decrees of Councils come to us is that of setting forth in writing what has ever been held orally or implicitly in the Church. Hence the frequent use of such phrases as <font face="SPIonic" size="6">eggrafwj ezeteqh</font><font size="6"> with reference to them. Thus Damasus, Theod. <i>H. E.</i> v. 10. speaks of that `apostolical faith, which was <i>set forth in writing</i> by the Fathers in Nicaea.' On the other hand, Ephrem of Antioch speaks of the doctrine of our Lord's perfect humanity being `inculcated by our Holy Fathers, but not as yet [i.e. till the Council of Chalcedon] being <i>confirmed</i> by the decree of an ecumenical Council' <i>Phot.</i> 229. p. 801. (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">eggrafwj</font><font size="6">, however, sometimes relates to the act of subscribing; Phot. <i>ibid.</i> or to Scripture, Clement. <i>Strom.</i> i. init. p. 321.) hence Athan. says <i>ad Afros.</i> 1. and 2. that `the Word of the Lord which was given through the ecumenical Council in Nicaea <i>remaineth for ever;</i>' and uses against its opposers the texts, `Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set' (vid. also Dionysius in Eus. <i>H.

Nay, Athan. says that the Nicene faith is sufficient to refute every heresy, <i>ad Max.</i> 5. fin.

Aetius at Chalcedon says that at Ephesus and Chalcedon the Fathers did not profess to draw up an exposition of faith, and that Cyril and Leo did but <i>interpret the Creed.</i> Conc. t. 2. p. 428. [t. iv. 1430, 1431 ed. Col. See this whole subject very amply treated in Dr. Pusey's <i>On the Clause, And the Son,</i> pp. 76 sqq.] Leo even says that the Apostles' Creed is sufficient against all heresies, and that Eutyches erred on a point `of which our Lord wished no one of either sex in the Church to be ignorant,' and he wishes Eutyches to take the plentitude of the Creed `puro et simplici corde.' <i>Ep.</i> 31. p. 857, 8.</font></p>

Thus Theodoret, `Plotinus, and Numenius, explaining the sense of Plato, say, that he taught Three principles beyond time and eternal, Good, Intellect, and the Soul of all,' <i>de Affect.</i> Cur ii. p. 750.

Again, `I have acquainted myself on their account [the Arians'] with the meaning of <font face="SPIonic" size="6">agenhton</font><font size="6">.' <i>Orat.</i> i. §30. This is remarkable, for Athan. was a man of liberal education, as his <i>Orat. contr. Gent.</i> and <i>de Incarn.</i> shew, especially, his acquaintance with the Platonic philosophy. Sulpicius too spears of him as a jurisconsultus, Sacr. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 50. S. Gregory Naz. says, that he gave some attention, but not much, to the subjects of general education, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">twn egkukliwn</font><font size="6">, that he might not be altogether ignorant, of what he nevertheless despised, <i>Orat.</i> 21. 6. In the same way S. Basil, whose cultivation of mind none can doubt, speaks slightingly of his own philosophical knowledge. He writes of his `neglecting his own weakness, and being utterly unexercised in such disquisitions;' <i>contr. Eunom.</i> init. And so in <i>de Sp.</i> §5. he says, that `they who have given time' to vain philosophy, `divide causes into principal, cooperative,' &amp;c. Elsewhere he speaks of having `expended much time on vanity, and wasted nearly all his youth in the vain labour of pursuing the studies of that wisdom which God has made foolishness,' <i>Ep.</i> 223. 2. In truth, Christianity has a philosophy of its own. Thus in the commencement of his <i>Vioe Dux</i> Anastasius says, `It is a first point to be understood, that the tradition of the Catholic Church does not proceed upon, or follow, the philosophical definitions in all respects, and especially as regards the mystery of Christ, and the doctrine of the Trinity, but a certain rule of its own, evangelical and apostolical.' p. 20.</font></p>

<sup>208 </sup>The Arians argued that the word <i>unoriginate</i> implied <i>originate</i> or <i>creature</i> as its correlative, and therefore indirectly signified <i>Creator;</i> so that the Son being not unoriginate, was not the Creator. Athan. answers, that in the use of the word, whether; there be a Son does not come into the question. As the idea of Father and Son does not include creation, so that of creator and creature does not include generation; and it would be as illogical to infer that there are no creatures because there is a Son as that there is no Son because there are creatures.</p>

And when Justin says of Christ </font><font face="SPIonic">o monoj legomenoj kuriwj uioj</font><font size="6">, <i>Apol.</i> ii. 6. </font><font face="SPIonic">kuriwj</font><font size="6"> seems to be used in reference to the word </font><font face="SPIonic">kurioj</font><font size="6">, Lord, which he has just been using, </font><font face="SPIonic">kuriologein</font><font size="6"> being sometimes used by him as others in the sense of `naming as Lord,' like </font><font face="SPIonic">qeologein</font><font size="6">. vid. <i>Tryph.</i> 56. There is a passage in Justin's <i>ad Groec.</i> 21. where he (or the writer) when speaking of </font><font face="SPIonic">egw eimi o wn</font><font size="6">, uses the word in the same ambiguous sense; </font><font face="SPIonic">ouden gar onoma epi qeou kuriologeisqai dunaton</font><font size="6">, 21; as if </font><font face="SPIonic">kurioj</font><font size="6">, the Lord, by which `I am' is translated, were a sort of symbol of that proper name of God which cannot be given. But to return; the true doctrine then is, that, whereas there is a primary and secondary sense in which the word Son is used, primary when it has its formal meaning of continuation of nature, and secondary when it is used nominally, or for an external resemblance to the first meaning, it is applied to the regenerate, not in the secondary sense, but in the primary. S. Basil and S. Gregory Nyssen consider Son to be `a term of <i>relationship</i> according to <i>nature</i>' (vid. supr. §10, note 1.), also Basil <i>in</i> Psalm xxviii. 1. The actual presence of the Holy Spirit in the regenerate in <i>substance</i> (vid. Cyril, <i>Dial</i> 7. p. 638.) constitutes this relationship of nature; and hence after the words quoted from S. Cyril in the beginning of the note, in which he says, that we are sons, </font><font face="SPIonic">fusikwj</font><font size="6">, he proceeds, `naturally, because <i>we are in Him,</i> and in Him alone.' vid. Athan.'s words which follow in the text at the end of §31. And hence Nyssen lays down, as a received truth, that `to none does the term "proper," </font><font face="SPIonic">kuriwtaton</font><font size="6">, apply, but to one in whom the name responds with truth to the nature,' <i>contr. Eunom.</i> iii. p. 123. And he also implies, p. 117, the intimate association of our sonship with Christ's, when he connects together regeneration with our Lord's eternal generation, neither being </font><font face="SPIonic">dia paqouj</font><font size="6">, or, of the will of the flesh. If it be asked, what the <i>distinctive</i> words are which are incommunicably the Son's, since so much is man's, it is obvious to answer, </font><font face="SPIonic">idioj uioj</font><font size="6"> and </font><font face="SPIonic">monogenhj</font><font size="6">, which are in Scripture, and the symbols `of the essence,' and `one in essence,' of the Council; and this is the value of the Council's phrases, that, while they guard the Son's divinity, they allow full scope, without risk of entrenching on it, to the Catholic doctrine of the fulness of the Christian privileges. vid. supr. §19, note. </font></p>

<sup>2 </sup>See Epiphanius, <i>Hoer.</i> lxviii. x. The arrangement is recognised as one of old standing in the sixth canon of Nicaea, `Let the old customs which exist in Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis remain in force, namely that the Bishop of Alexandria should have authority over all these regions; since this is also customary for the Bishop of Rome. Likewise also at Antioch and in the other prefectures (it is decreed) that their prerogatives should be maintained to those churches.' The canon points to the natural explanation of the arrangement: the bishops of the capitals began from a very early date to exercise a loosely defined but gradually strengthening supervision over those of the rest of the province. In particular, they came to exercise a veto (and latterly more than a veto) upon the appointments to the provincial sees (<font face="SPIonic" size="6">ei tij xwrij gnwmhj</font><font size="6">, ib.). The bishops of Alexandria as well as Rome had even at this date acquired something of the rank of secular potentates (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">dunasteia</font><font size="6">, <i>Socr.</i> vii. 11, </font><font face="SPIonic">hdh palai</font><font size="6">), but not to the extent to which it went later on (ib. 7. and supr. <i>Apol.

<sup>15 </sup>But our annalist gives May 3, while <i>Fest Ind.</i> gives May 2, the day solemnised in the Coptic Martyrologies (Mai, <i>Script. Vett.</i> vol. 4, part 2, pp. 29, 114), and doubtless the right one. Perhaps, if Athanasius died in the night of May 2-3, the former day might be chosen for his commemoration, while our annalist may still be literally exact.</p>

<sup>1 </sup>This heading, preserved in the Evagrian version, is probably the original one. Compare the statement to the same effect in <i>Vit. Pachom.</i> 63. The preface to the Evagrian version is important as bearing on the question of interpolation. It runs as follows: `Evagrius, presbyter, to his dearest son Innocent, greeting in the Lord. A word-for-word translation from one language to another obscures the sense and as it were chokes the corn with luxuriant grass. For in slavishly following cases and constructions, the language scarcely explains by lengthy periphrasis what it might state by concise expression. To avoid this, I have at your request rendered the Life of the blessed Antony in such a way as to give the full sense, but cut short somewhat of the words. Let others try to catch syllables and letters; do you seek the meaning.'</p>

<sup>2 </sup>Cf 2 Kings iii. 11: the expression merely refers to personal attendance (contrast §§47, 93). The text is uncertain, as some mss., both Greek and Latin read, `was able to learn <i>from him who</i> was his attendant,' &amp;c. The question of textual evidence requires further sifting. In support of the statement in the text we may cite <i>Ap. c. Ar.</i> 6, where Ath. is called `one of the ascetics,' which may, but need not, refer to something of the kind.</p>

<sup>142 </sup>It is certainly startling to find Antony, ignorant of Greek and of letters, reasoning with philosophers upon the doctrines of Neoplatonism. His whole life, excepting two short visits to Alexandria, had been spent out of ear-shot of such discussions. Yet it is not easy to say exactly how much a man of strong mind and retentive memory may have picked up from the conversation of those who visited him upon subjects so widely discussed as these speculations were.</p>

<sup>151 </sup>Cf. below, `what the Arians are now doing.' This incidental notice of time fixes the date of the present passage. Weingarten in vain attempts to extract some other sense from the Greek, which is plainness itself. It also fixes the date of Antony's death to within two years of the troubles in question. The Benedictines refer the troubles to the intrusion of Gregory `in 341' (really 339), and the apparently unprecedented character ascribed to the outrages by Antony is in favour of this, as well as the fact (<i>Encyc. 3</i>) that in 339 the heathen are said to have offered sacrifice in the churches. But the latter is only in superficial agreement with the Greek text of the present passage, which speaks of <i>Arian</i> <font face="SPIonic" size="6">sunaceij</font><font size="6"> at which heathen were impressed to be present, apparently to make some show of a congregation. The Evagrian version, indeed, adds that the Gentiles on this occasion also carried on idolatrous rites in the Church and polluted the baptisteries; but Evagrius is in the habit of interpolating little details from his own knowledge or opinion (e.g. 16, `Ita exorsus,' &amp;c., 26, `qui vinctas hominum linguas solvebat,' 58, `qui effosso pro Christo oculo sub Maximiano,' &amp;c.), and in this case appears to borrow from <i>Encycl.</i> 3. Again, the writer of the <i>Vita</i> was not present (`the bystanders' <i>supra;</i> `<i>they</i> troubled him;' `they asked him;' ...and <i>infr.</i> `those with him') when the Vision took place: but when, two years later, it was interpreted by events, he was in the company of those who had been with Antony at the time (<i>infr.</i> `then we all understood'). This (on the assumption of Athanasian authorship) excludes the year 339, when Athenasius fled to Italy, and compels us to refer the Vision to the troubles of 356 (Apol. Fug. 6, 7. Hist. Ar. 55, 56, <i>Ep. ad Lucif.</i>), after which Athanasius fled to the desert and was in the company of the monks. This conclusion is in independent agreement with (1) the fact, decisive by itself, that Antony is still alive in 345, when Nestorius became Prefect of Egypt (§86, note 3), i.e. six years after the troubles of 339; (2) the evidence that Antony was still living about 353 a.d. (<i>Epist. Ammon. de Pachom. et Theod.</i> 20, 21, in <i>Act. SS. Mai.</i> tom. iii. Appendix 70 C E, <i>Tillemont vii. 123</i>), and (3) the statement of Jerome (Chron.) that Antony died in 356. Against it Weingarten urges the prophecy of restored peace to the Church (<i>infr.</i>) as pointing to a time after the overthrow of Arianism. This is of little weight, for the prophecy expresses only what must have been the hope and belief of all. The prologue, which Tillemont (viii. 227) thinks must have been written in a time of peace at Alexandria, is not sufficiently explicit on the point to weigh against the plain sense of the present passage.</font></p>

<sup>163 </sup>The body of Antony was discovered `by a revelation' in 561, and translated to Alexandria. When the Saracens conquered Egypt it was transferred to Constantinople, and lastly in the tenth century was carried to Vienne by a French Seigneur. The first and last links of this history are naturally precarious. The trans. lation to Alexandria is vouched for by Victor of Tunis (<i>Chron.</i>) who was in the neighbourhood at the time.</p>

<sup>164 </sup>Jerome, in his life of Paul of Thebes, relates that Antony received from Paul, and ever afterwards wore on festivals, his tunic of palm-leaves. If this `legacy more glorious than the purple of a king' (<i>Vit. Paul.</i> c. 13) had any existence, it would certainly not have been forgotten by Antony in disposing of his worldly goods. The silence of the Life of Antony throws discredit on Jerome's whole account of Paul. </p>

<sup>26 </sup>[June 26, 345. Athanasius received some at least of the letters at Aquileia, where he spent Easter, 345 (<i>Apol. Ar.</i> 51, Fest. Ind. xvii.). He then went to see Constans at Treveri, apparently in May, 346 (<i>Apol. Const.</i> 4, Gwatkin, Stud. 127, n.). This compels us to assume that the first invitation to Ath. to return must have been wrung (<i>infr.</i> 49, 50) from Constantius before the death of Gregory. The statement in the text is therefore so far inexact, but the lung illness of Gregory must have made his death a matter of daily expectation, cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §6 (3) fin.]</p>

<sup>14 </sup>The early theory about persecution seems to have been this,-that that was a bad cause which `depended' upon it, but that, when a `cause' was good, there was nothing wrong in using force in due `subordination' to argument [so Pius IX. in <i>Encycl.</i> `Quanta cura,' speaks of the 'officium coercendi sancitis poenis violatores catholicae religionis]; that there was as little impropriety in the civil magistrate's inducing `individuals' by force, when they were incapable of higher motives, as by those secular blessings which follow on Christianity. Our Lord's kingdom was not of this world, that is, it did not depend on this world; but, as subduing, engrossing, and swaying this world, it at times condescended to make use of this world's weapons against itself. The simple question was `whether a cause depended on force for its existence.' S. Athanasius declared and the event proved, that Arianism was so dependent. When Emperors ceased to persecute, Arianism ceased to be; it had no life in itself. Again, all cruel persecution, or long continued, or on a large scale, was wrong, as arguing `an absence' of moral and rational grounds in the `cause' so maintained. Again, there was an evident `impropriety' in ecclesiastical functionaries using secular weapons, as there would be in their engaging in a secular pursuit, or forming secular connections; whereas the soldier might as suitably, and should as dutifully, defend religion with the sword, as the scholar with his pen. And further there was an abhorrence of cruelty natural to us, which it was a duty to cherish and maintain. All this being considered, there is no inconsistency in S. Athanasius denouncing persecution, and in Theodosius decreeing that `the heretical teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops or Presbyters,' should be `exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation.'

<sup>96 </sup>Since the Consuls came into office on the first of January, and were proclaimed in each city, it is strange that the Alexandrians here speak in February as if ignorant of their names. The phrase, however, is found elsewhere. Thus in this very year the <i>Chron. Aceph.</i> dates Jan. 5 as `post Consulatum Arbitionis et Loliani.' And in Socr. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 29, in the instance of the year 351, when there were no Consuls, and in 346, when there was a difference on the subject between the Emperors who were eventually themselves Consuls, the first months are dated in like manner from the Consuls of the foregoing year.</p>

Still Arianism was contrasted with other heresies on this point, as in these two respects; (1.) they appealed to a <i>secret tradition,</i> unknown even to most of the Apostles, as the Gnostics, Iren. <i>Haer.</i> iii. 1 or they professed a gift of prophecy introducing fresh <i>revelations,</i> as Montanists, <i>de Syn.</i> 4, and Manichees, Aug. <i>contr.

<sup>10 </sup>He seems to allude to Catholics being called Athanasians; vid. however next §. Two distinctions are drawn between such a title as applied to Carbolics, and again to heretics, when they are taken by Catholics as a <i>note</i> against them. S. Augustine says, `<i>Arians</i> call Catholics Athanasians or Homoüsians, <i>not other heretics too.</i> But ye not only by Catholics <i>but also by heretics,</i> those who agree with you and those who disagree, are called Pelagians; as <i>even by heresies</i> are Arians called Arians. But ye, and ye only, call us Traducianists, as Arians call us Homoüsians, as Donatists Macarians, as Manichees Pharisees, and as the other heretics use various titles.' <i>Op. imp.</i> i. 75. It may be added that the heretical name <i>adheres,</i> the Catholic dies away. S. Chrysostom draws a second distinction, `Are we divided from the Church? have we heresiarchs? are we called from many is there any leader to us, as to one there is Marcion, to another Manichaeus, to another Arius, to another some other author of heresy? for if we too have the name of any, still it is not those who began the heresy, <i>but our superiors and governors of the Church.</i> We have not "teachers upon earth,"' &amp;c. in Act. <i>Ap.

<sup>15 </sup>It is very difficult to gain a clear idea of the character of Arius. [Prolegg. ch. ii. §2.] Epiphanius's account of Arius is as follows:-`From elation of mind the old man swerved from the mark. He was in stature very tall, downcast in visage, with manners like wily serpent, captivating to every guileless heart by that same crafty bearing. For ever habited in cloke and vest, he was pleasant of address, ever persuading souls and flattering; wherefore what was his very first work but to withdraw from the Church in one body as many as seven hundred women who professed virginity.?' <i>Haer.</i> 69. 3, cf. ib. §9 for a strange description of Arius attributed to Constantine, also printed in the collections of councils: Hard. i. 457.</p>

<sup>23 </sup>Vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 15, note 6. <font face="SPIonic" size="6">katalhyij</font><font size="6"> was originally a Stoic word, and even when considered perfect, was, properly speaking, attributable only to an imperfect being. For it is used in contrast to the Platonic doctrine of </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ideai</font><font size="6">, to express the hold of things obtained by the mind through the senses; it being a Stoical maxim, nihil esse in intellectu quod non fuerit in sensu. In this sense it is also used by the Fathers, to mean real and certain knowledge after inquiry, though it is also ascribed to Almighty God. As to the position of Arius, since we are told in Scripture that none `knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,' if </font><font face="SPIonic">katalhyij</font><font size="6"> be an exact and complete knowledge of the object of contemplation, to deny that the Son comprehended the Father, was to deny that He was in the Father, i.e. the doctrine of the </font><font face="SPIonic">pericwrhsij</font><font size="6">, <i>de Syn.</i> 15, </font><font face="SPIonic">anepimiktoi</font><font size="6">, or to maintain that He was a distinct, and therefore a created, being. On the o her hand Scripture asserts that, as the Holy Spirit which is in God, `searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God,' so the Son, as being `in the bosom of the Father,' alone `hath declared Him.' vid. Clement. <i>Strom.</i> v. 12. And thus Athan. speaking of Mark xiii. 32, 'If the Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son, and the Father knows the day and the hour, it is plain that the Son too, being in the Father, and knowing the things in the Father, Himself also knows the day and the hour." <i>Orat.</i> iii. 44.</font></p>

<sup>61 </sup>Athan. observes that this formula of the Arians is a mere evasion to escape using the word `time.' vid. also Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> iv. pp. 19, 20. Else let them explain,-`There was,' <i>what</i> `when the Son was not?' or <i>what</i> was before the Son? since He Himself was before all times and ages, which He created, <i>de Decr.</i> 18, note 5. Thus, if `when' be a word of time, He it is who <i>was</i> `when' He <i>was not</i>, which is absurd. Did they mean, however, that it was the Father who `was' before the Son? This was true, if `before' was taken, not to imply time, but origination or beginning. And in this sense the first verse of S. John's Gospel may be interpreted `In the Beginning,' or Origin, i.e. in the Father `was the Word.' Thus Athan. himself understands that text, <i>Orat.</i> iv. §1. vid. also <i>Orat.</i> iii. §9; Nyssen. <i>contr. Eunom.</i> iii. p. 106; Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> 32. p. 312.</p>

<sup>68 </sup>2 Cor. iii. 16, 2 Cor. iii. 17. S. Athanasius observes, <i>Serap.</i> i. 4-7, that the Holy Ghost is never in Scripture called simply `Spirit' without the addition `of God' or `of the Father' or `from Me' or of the article, or of `Holy,' or `Comforter,' or `of truth,' or unless He has been spoken of just before. Accordingly this text is understood of the third Person in the Holy Trinity by Origen, <i>contr. Cels.</i> vi. 70; Basil <i>de Sp. S.</i> n. 32; Psendo-Athan. <i>de comm. ess.</i> 6. On the other hand, the word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">pneuma</font><font size="6">, 'Spirit, is used more or less distinctly for our Lord's Divine Nature whether in itself or as incarnate, in Rom. i. 4, 1 Cor. xv. 45, 1 Tim. iii. 16, Hebr. ix. 14, 1 Pet. iii. 18, John vi. 63, &amp;c. [But cf. also Milligan <i>Resurr.</i> 238 sq.] Indeed the early Fathers speak as if the `Holy Spirit,' which came down upon S. Mary might be considered the Word. E.g. Tertullian against the Valentinians, `If the Spirit of God did not descend into the womb "to partake in flesh from the womb," why did He descend at all?' <i>de Carn. Chr.</i> 19. vid. also ibid. 5 and 14. <i>contr. Prax.</i> 26, Just. <i>Apol.</i> i. 33. Iren. <i>Hoer.</i> v. 1. Cypr. <i>Idol Van.</i> 6.

And more distinctly even as late as S. Maximus, </font><font face="SPIonic">auton anti sporaj sullabousa ton logon, kekuhke</font><font size="6">, t. 2. p. 309. The earliest ecclesiastical authorities are S. Ignatius <i>ad Smyrn.</i> init. and S. Hermas (even though his date were a.d. 150), who also says plainly: Filius autem Spiritus Sanctus est. <i>Sim.</i> v. 5, 2, cf. ix. 1.

<sup>94 </sup>This was an objection urged by Eunomius, cf. <i>de Syn.</i> 51, note 8. It is implied also in the Apology of the former, §24, and in Basil. <i>contr. Eunom.</i> ii. 28. Aetius was in Alexandria with George of Cappadocia, a.d. 356-8, and Athan. wrote these Discourses in the latter year, as the <i>de Syn.</i> at the end of the next. It is probable then that he is alluding to the Anomoean arguments as he heard them reported, vid. de Syn. l.c. where he says, `they say, "as you have written,"' §51. <font face="SPIonic" size="6">Anomoioj kat ousian</font><font size="6"> is mentioned infr. §17.

When it is said that the First Person of the Holy Trinity communicates divinity to the Second, it is meant that that one Essence which is the Father, also is the Son. Hence the force of the word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">omoousion</font><font size="6">, which was in consequence accused of Sabellianism, but was distinguished from it by the particle </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">omou</font><font size="6">, `together,' which implied a difference as well as unity; whereas </font><font face="SPIonic">tautoousion</font><font size="6"> or </font><font face="SPIonic">sunousion</font><font size="6"> implied, with the Sabellians, an identity or a confusion. The Arians, on the other hand, as in the instance of Eusebius, &amp;c., supr. p. 75, note 7; <i>de Syn.</i> 26, note 3; considered the Father and the Son two </font><font face="SPIonic">ousiai</font><font size="6">. The Catholic doctrine is that, though the Divine Essence is both the Father Ingenerate and also the Only-begotten Son, it is not itself </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font size="6"> or </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhth</font><font size="6">; which was the objection urged against the Catholics by Aetius, Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 76. 10.

It must not be supposed from these instances that the Fathers meant that our Lord was literally what is called the <i>attribute</i> of reason or wisdom in the Divine Essence, or in other words, that He was God merely viewed as He is wise; which would be a kind of Sabellianism. But, whereas their opponents said that He was but <i>called</i> Word and Wisdom <i>after</i> the attribute (vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 15, note), they said that such titles marked, not only a typical resemblance to the attribute, but so full a correspondence and (as it were) coincidence in <i>nature</i> with it, that whatever relation that attribute had to God, such in kind had the Son;-that the attribute was His symbol, and not His mere archetype; that our Lord was eternal and proper to God, because that attribute was, which was His title, vid. <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> 14, that our Lord was that Essential Reason and Wisdom,-not <i>by</i> which the Father <i>is</i> wise, but <i>without</i> which the Father was <i>not</i> wise;-not, that is, in the way of a formal cause, but in <i>fact.</i> Or, whereas the Father Himself is Reason and Wisdom, the Son is the necessary result of that Reason and Wisdom, so that, to say that there was no Word, would imply there was no Divine Reason; just as a radiance implies a light; or, as Petavius remarks, l.c. quoting the words which follow shortly after in the text, the eternity of the Original implies the eternity of the Image; </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">thj upostasewj uparxoushj, pantwj euquj einai dei ton xarkthra kai thn eikona tauthj</font><font size="6">, §20. vid. also infr. §31, <i>de Decr.</i> §13, p. 21, §§29, 23, pp. 35, 40.

<sup>135 </sup>This was but the opposite aspect of the tenet of our Lord's consubstantiality or eternal generation. For if He came into being at the will of God, by the same will He might cease to be; but if His existence is unconditional and necessary, as God's attributes might be, then as He had no beginning, so can He have no end; for He is in, and one with, the Father, who has neither beginning nor end.

<sup>139 </sup>Athan. argues from the very name Image for our Lord's eternity. An Image, to be really such, must be an expression from the Original, not an external and detached imitation. vid. supr. note 10, infr. §26. Hence S. Basil, `He is an Image not made with the hand, or a work of art, but a living Image,' &amp;c. vid. also <i>contr. Eunom.</i> ii. 16, 17. Epiph <i>Hoer.</i> 76. 3. Hilar. <i>Trin.</i> vii. 41 fin. Origen observes that man, on the contrary, is an example of an external or improper image of God. <i>Periarch.</i> i. 2. §6. It might have been more direct to have argued from the name of Image to our Lord's consubstantiality rather than eternity, as, e.g. S. Gregory Naz. `He is Image as one in essence, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">omoousion</font><font size="6">, ...for this is the nature of an image, to be a copy of the archetype.' <i>Orat.</i> 30. 20. vid. also <i>de Decr.</i> §§20, 23, but for whatever reason Athan. avoids the word </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">omoousion</font><font size="6"> in these Discourses.

<sup>145 </sup>The objection is this, that, if our Lord be the Father's Image, He ought to resemble Him in being a Father. S. Athanasius answers that God is not as man; with us a son becomes a father because our nature is <font face="SPIonic" size="6">reusth</font><font size="6">, transitive and without stay, ever shifting and passing on into new forms and relations; but that God is perfect and ever the same, what He is once that He continues to be; God the Father remains Father, and God the Son remains Son. Moreover men become fathers by detachment and transmission, and what is received is handed on in a succession; whereas the Father, by imparting Himself wholly, begets the Son: and a perfect nativity finds its termination in itself. The Son has not a Son, because the Father has not a Father. Thus the Father is the only true Father, and the Son alone true Son; the Father only a Father, the Son only a Son; being really in their Persons what human fathers are but by office, character, accident, and name; vid. <i>De Decr.</i> 11, note 6. And since the Father is unchangeable as Father, in nothing does the Son more fulfil the idea of a perfect Image than in being unchangeable too. Thus S. Cyril also, <i>Thesaur.</i> 10. p. 124. And this perhaps may illustrate a strong and almost startling implication of some of the Greek Fathers, that the First Person in the Holy Trinity, is not God [<i>in virtue</i> of His Fatherhood]. E.g. </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ei de qeoj o uioj, ouk epei uioj: omoiwj kai o pathr, ouk epei pathr, qeoj: all' epei ousia toiade, eij esti pathr kai o uioj qeoj</font><font size="6">. <i>Nyssen.</i> t. i. p. 915. vid. Petav. <i>de Deo</i> i. 9. §13. Should it be asked, `What is the Father if not God?' it is enough to answer, `the Father.' Men differ from each other as being individuals, but the characteristic difference between Father and Son is, not that they are individuals, but that they <i>are</i> Father and Son. In these extreme statements it must he ever horne in mind that we are contemplating divine things according to <i>our notions.</i> not in <i>fact:</i> i.e. speaking of the Almighty Father, <i>as such;</i> there being no real separation between His Person and His Substance. It may be added, that, though theologians differ in their decisions, it would appear that our Lord is not the Image of the Father's person, but of the Father's substance; in other words, not of the Father considered as Father, but considered as God That is, God the Son is like and equal to God the Father, because they are both the same God. <i>De Syn.</i> 49. note 4, also next note</font></p>

<sup>148 </sup>This miserable procedure, of making sacred and mysterious subjects a matter of popular talk and debate, which is a sure mark of heresy, had received a great stimulus about this time by the rise of the Anomoeans. Eusebius's testimony to the profaneness which attended Arianism upon its rise will be given <i>de Syn.</i> 2, note 1. The Thalia is another instance of it. S. Alexander speaks of the interference, even judicial, in its behalf against himself, of disobedient women, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">di' entuxiaj gunaikariwn ataktwn a hpathsan</font><font size="6">, and of the busy and indecent gadding about of the younger, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ek tou peritroxazein pasan aguian asemnwj</font><font size="6">. ap. Theod. <i>H.E.</i> i. 3. p. 730, also p. 747; also of the men's buffoon conversation, p. 731. Socrates says that `in the Imperial Court, the officers of the bedchamber held disputes with the women, and in the city in every house there was a war of dialectics.' <i>Hist.</i> ii. 2. This mania raged especially in Constantinople, and S. Gregory Naz. speaks of `Jezebels in as thick a crop as hemlock in a field.' <i>Orat.</i> 35. 3, cf. <i>de Syn.</i> 13, n. 4. He speaks of the heretics as `aiming at one thing only, how to make good or refute points of argument,' making `every market-place resound with their words, and spoiling every entertainment with their trifling and offensive talk.' <i>Orat.</i> 27. 2. The most remarkable testimony of the kind though not concerning Constantinople, is given by S. Gregory Nyssen, and often quoted, `Men of yesterday and the day before, mere mechanics, off-hand dogmatists in theology, servants too and slaves that have been flogged, runaways from servile work, are solemn with us and philosophical about things incomprehensible. ...With such the whole city is full; its smaller gates, forums, squares, thoroughfares; the clothes-venders, the money-lenders, the victuallers. Ask about pence, and he will discuss the Generate and Ingenerate; inquire the price of bread, he answers, Greater is the Father, and the Son is subject; say that a bath would suit you, mad he defines that the Son is out of nothing.' t. 2. p. 898.</font></p>

<sup>163 </sup>Supr. <i>de Decr.</i> 6. The question was, <i>What</i> was that sense of Son which would apply to the Divine Nature? The Catholics said that its essential meaning <i>could</i> apply, viz. consubstantiality, whereas the point of posteriority to the Father depended on a condition, <i>time,</i> which could not exist in the instance of God. ib. 10. The Arians on the other hand said, that to suppose a true Son, was to think of God irreverently, as implying division, change, &amp;c. The Catholics replied that the notion of materiality was quite as foreign from the Divine Essence as time, and as the Divine Sonship was eternal, so was it also clear both of imperfection or extension.</p>

<sup>164 </sup>It is from expressions such as this that the Greek Fathers have been accused of tritheism. The truth is, every illustration, as being incomplete on one or other side of it, taken by itself, tends to heresy. The title Son by itself suggests a second God, as the title Word a mere attribute, and the title Instrument a creature. All heresies are partial views of the truth, and are wrong, not so much in what they say, as in what they deny. The truth, on the other hand, is a positive and comprehensive doctrine, and in consequence necessarily mysterious and open to misconception. vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 41, note 1. When Athan, implies that the Eternal Father is in the Son, though remaining what He is, as a man in his child, he is intent only upon the point of the Son's connaturality and equality, which the Arians denied. Cf. <i>Orat.</i> iii. §5; Ps.-Ath. <i>Dial</i> i. (Migne xxviii. 1144 C.). S. Cyril even seems to deny that each individual man may be considered a separate substance except as the Three Persons are such (<i>Dial.</i> i. p. 409); and S. Gregory Nyssen is led to say that, strictly speaking, the abstract <i>man</i>, which is predicated of separate individuals, is still one, and this with a view of illustrating the Divine Unity. <i>ad Ablab.</i> t. 2. p. 449. vid.

<sup>166 </sup>S. Athanasius's doctrine is, that, God containing in Himself all perfection, whatever is excellent in one created thing above another, is found in its perfection in Him. If then such generation as radiance from light is more perfect than that of children from parents, that belongs, and transcendently, to the All-perfect God. </p>

<sup>167 </sup>This is a view familiar to the Fathers, viz. that in this consists our Lord's Sonship, that He is the Word, or as S Augustine says, Christum ideo Filium quia Verbum.

<sup>169 </sup>Heretics have frequently assigned reverence as the cause of their opposition to the Church; and if even Arius affected it, the plea may be expected in any other. `O stultos et impios metus,' says S. Hilary, `et irreligiosam de Deo sollicitudinem.' <i>de Trin.</i> iv. 6. It was still more commonly professed in regard to the Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation. Cf. <i>Acta Archelai</i> [Routh. <i>Rell.</i> v. 169]. August. <i>contr. Secund.</i> 9, <i>contr. Faust.</i> xi. 3. As the Manichees denied our Lord a body, so the Apollinarians denied Him a rational soul, still under pretence of reverence because, as they said, the soul was necessarily sinful. Leontius makes this their main argument, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">o nouj amarthtikoj esti</font><font size="6">. <i>de Sect.</i> iv. p. 507. vid. also Greg.

Athan., &amp;c., call the Apollinarian doctrine Manichaan in consequence. vid. in <i>Apoll.</i> ii. 8. 9. &amp;c. Again, the Eranistes in Theodoret, who advocates a similar doctrine, will not call our Lord <i>man.</i> <i>Eranist.</i> ii. p. 83. Eutyches, on the other hand, would call our Lord <i>man,</i> but refused to admit His human <i>nature,</i> and still with the same profession.

<sup>172 </sup>Athan.'s argument is as follows: that, as it is of the essence of a son to be `connatural' with the father, so is it of the essence of a creature to be of `nothing,' <font face="SPIonic" size="6">ec ouk ontwn</font><font size="6">; therefore, while it was <i>not</i> impossible `from the nature of the case,' for Almighty God to be always Father, it <i>was</i> impossible for the same reason that He should be always a Creator. vid. infr. §58: where he takes, `They shall perish,' in the Psalm, not as a fact but as the definition of the <i>nature</i> of a creature.

Hence Athan. retorts, </font><font face="SPIonic">faskontej, ou legomen duo agenhta, legousi duo qeouj</font><font size="6">. <i>Orat.</i> iii. 16, also ii. 38. Plato used </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhton</font><font size="6"> of the Supreme God [not so; he used </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhton</font><font size="6">, see note 2 on <i>de Decr.</i> 28]; the Valentinians, Tertull. <i>contr. Val.</i> 7; and Basilides, Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 31. 10. S. Clement uses it, see <i>de Syn.</i> 47, note 7. [The earlier Arians apparently argued mainly, like Asterius, from </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6"> (cr. Epiph. 64. 8), the later (</font><font face="SPIonic">kainoi</font><font size="6">, Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 73. 19) Anomoeans rather from </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font size="6">]; viz. that </font><font face="SPIonic">h agennhsia</font><font size="6"> is the very </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font size="6"> of God, not an attribute. So Aetius in Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 76. S. Athanasius does not go into this question, but rather confines himself to the more popular form of it, viz. the Son is by His very name not </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6">, but </font><font face="SPIonic">genhtoj</font><font size="6">, but all </font><font face="SPIonic">genhta</font><font size="6"> are creatures; which he answers, as <i>de Decr.</i> §28, by saying that Christianity had brought in a new idea into theology, viz. the sacred doctrine of a true Son, </font><font face="SPIonic">ek thj ousiaj</font><font size="6">. This was what the Arians had originally denied </font><font face="SPIonic">en to agennhton en de to up' autou alhqwj, kai ouk ek thj ousiaj autou gegonoj</font><font size="6">. Euseb. Nic. ap. Theod. <i>H.E.</i> i. 6. When they were urged <i>what</i> according to them was the middle idea to which the Son answered, if they would not accept the Catholic, they would not define but merely said, </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhma, all' ouk wj en twn gennhuatwn</font><font size="6">.

<sup>177 </sup>The two first senses here given answer to the two first mentioned, <i>de Decr.</i> §28. and, as he there says, are plainly irrelevant. The third in the <i>de Decr.</i> which, as he there observes, is ambiguous and used for a sophistical purpose, is here divided into third and fourth, answering to the two senses which alone are assigned in the <i>de Syn.</i> §46 [where see note 5], and on them the question turns. This is an instance, of which many occur, how Athan. used his former writings and worked over again his former ground, and simplified or cleared what he had said. In the <i>de Decr.</i> after 350, we have three senses of <font face="SPIonic" size="6">agenhton</font><font size="6">, two irrelevant and the third ambiguous; here in <i>Orat.</i> i. (358), he divides the third into two; in the <i>de Syn.</i> (359), he rejects and omits the two first, leaving the two last, which are the critical senses. </font></p>

<sup>184 </sup>The passage which follows is written with his <i>de Decr.</i> before him. At first he but uses the same topics, but presently he incorporates into this Discourse an actual portion of his former work, with only stroh alterations as an author commonly makes in transcribing. This, which is not unfrequent with Athan., shews us the care with which he made his doctrinal statements, though they seem at first sight written off. It also accounts for the diffuseness and repetition which might be imputed to his composition, what seems superfluous being often only the insertion of an extract from a former work.</p>

<sup>210 </sup>The Arians perhaps more than other heretics were remarkable for bringing objections against the received view, rather than forming a consistent theory of their own Indeed the very vigour and success of their assault upon the truth lay in its being a mere assault, not a positive and substantive teaching. They therefore, even more than others, might fairly be urged on to the consequences of their positions. Now the text in question, as it must be interpreted if it is to serve as an objection, was an objection also to the received doctrine of the Arians. They considered that our Lord was above and before all creatures from the first, and their Creator; how then could He be exalted above all? They surely, as much as Catholics, were obliged to explain it of our Lord's manhood. They could not then use it as a weapon against the Church, until they took the ground of Paul of Samosata.</p>

<sup>218 </sup>In this passage Athan. considers that the participation ofthe Word is deification, as communion with the Son is adoption: also that the old Saints, inasmuch as they are called `gods' and `sons,' did partake of the Divine Word and Son, or in other words were gifted with the Spirit. He asserts the same doctrine very strongly in <i>Orat.</i> iv. §22. On the other hand, infr. 47, he says expressly that Christ received the Spirit in Baptism `that He might give it to man.' There is no real contradiction in such statements; what was given in one way under the Law, was given in another and fuller under the Gospel.</p>

<sup>230 </sup>Scripture is full of misteries, but they are mysteries of <i>fact,</i> not of words. Its dark sayings or aenigmata are such, because in the nature of things they cannot be expressed clearly. Hence contrariwise. <i>Orat</i> ii. §77 fin. he calls Prov. viii. 22. an enigma, with an allusion to Prov. i. 6. Sept. In like manner S. Ambrose. says, Mare est scriptura divina, habens in se sensus profundos, et altitudinem propheticorum <i>oenigmatum,</i> &amp;c. <i>Ep</i>. ii. 3. What is commonly called `explaining away' Scripture, is this transference of the obscurity from the subject to the words used.</p>

<sup>234 </sup>When Scripture says that our Lord was exalted, it means in that sense in which He could be exalted; just as, in saying that a man walks or eats, we speak of him not as a spirit, but as in that system of things to which the ideas of walking and eating belong. Exaltation is not a word which can belong to God; it is unmeaning, and <i>therefore</i> is <i>not</i> applied to Him in the text in question. Thus, e.g. S. Ambrose: `Ubi humilatus, ibi obediens. Ex eo enim nascitur obedientia, ex quo humilitas <i>et in eo desinit,</i>' &amp;c. <i>Ap. Dav. alt.</i> n. 39.</p>

<sup>244 </sup>It was usual to say against the Apollinarians, that, unless our Lord took on Him our nature; <i>as it is,</i> He had not purified and changed it, as it is, but another nature; `The Lord came not to save Adam as free from sin, that He should become like unto him; but as, in the net of sin and now fallen, that God's mercy might raise him up with Christ.' Leont. <i>contr. Nestor.</i> &amp;c. ii. p. 996. Accordingly, Athan. says elsewhere, `Had not sinlessness appeared [cf. Rom. viii. 3, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">pemyaj</font><font size="6">] "in the nature which had sinned," how was sin condemned in the flesh?' in <i>Apoll.</i> ii. 6. `It was necessary for our salvation,' says S. Cyril, `that the Word of God should become man, that human flesh "subject to corruption" and "sick with the lust of pleasures," He might make His own; and. "whereas He is life and lifegiving," He might "destroy the corruption," &amp;c. ...For by this means, might sin in our flesh become dead.' Ep. ad <i>Success.</i> i. p. 138. And S. Leo, `Non alterius naturae erat ejus caro quam nostra, nec alio illi quam caeteris hominibus anima est inspirata principio, quae excelleret, non diversitate generis, sed sublimitate virtutis.' <i>Ep.</i> 35 fin. vid. also <i>Ep.</i> 28. 3. <i>Ep.</i> 31. 2. <i>Ep.</i> 165. 9. <i>Serm.</i> 22. 2. and 25. 5. It may be asked whether this doctrine does not interfere with that of the immaculate conception [i.e. that <i>Christ</i> was conceived sinless]; but that miracle was wrought in order that our Lord might not be born in original sin, and does not affect, or rather includes, His taking flesh of the substance of the Virgin, i.e. of a fallen nature. If indeed sin were `of the substance' of our fallen nature, as some heretics have said, then He could not have taken our nature without partaking our sinfulness; but if sin be, as it is, a fault of the <i>will,</i> then the Divine Power of the Word could sanctfy the human will, and keep it from swerving in the direction of evil. Hence `We say not that Christ by the felicity of a flesh separated from sense <i>could not</i> feel the desire of sin, but that by perfection of virtue, and by a flesh not begotten through concupiscence of the flesh, He <i>had not</i> the desire of sin;' Aug. <i>Op. Imperf.</i> iv. 48. On the other hand, S. Athanasius expressly calls it Manichean doctrine to consider </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">thn fusin</font><font size="6"> of the flesh </font><font face="SPIonic">amartian, kai ou thn pracin</font><font size="6">. <i>contr. Apoll.</i> i. 12 fin. or </font><font face="SPIonic">fusikhn einai thn amartian</font><font size="6">. ibid. i. 14 fin. His argument in the next ch. is on the ground that all <i>natures</i> are from God, but God made man upright nor is the author of evil (vid. also Vit. Anton. 20); `not as if,' he says, `the devil wrought in man a nature (God forbid!) for of a nature the evil cannot be maker (</font><font face="SPIonic">dhmiourgoj</font><font size="6">) as is the impiety of the Manichees, but he wrought a bias of nature by transgression, and `so death reigned over all men.' Wherefore, saith he, `the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil;' what works? that nature, which God made sinless, and the devil biassed to the transgression of God's command and the finding out of sin which is death, did God the Word raise again, so as to be secure from the devil's bias and the finding out of sin. And therefore the Lord said, "The prince of this world cometh and findeth nothing in Me."' vid. also §19. Ibid. ii. 6. he speaks of the devil having `introduced the <i>law</i> of sin.' vid. also §9.</font></p>

<sup>253 </sup>It was a point in controversy with the extreme Monophysites, that is, the Eutychians, whether our Lord's body was naturally subject to death, the Catholics maintaining the affirmative, as Athanasius here. Eutyches asserted that our Lord had not a human nature, by which he meant among other things that His manhood was not subject to the <i>laws</i> of a body, but so far as He submitted to them, He did so by an act of will in each particular case; and this, lest it should seem that He was moved by the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">paqh</font><font size="6"> against His will </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">akousiwj</font><font size="6">; and consequently that His manhood was not subject to death. But the Catholics maintained that He had voluntarily placed Himself <i>under</i> those laws, and died <i>naturally,</i> vid. Athan. <i>contr. Apol.</i> i. 17, and that after the resurrection His body became incorruptible, not according to nature, but by grace. vid. Leont. <i>de Sect.</i> x. p. 530. Anast. <i>Hodeg.</i> c. 23. To express their doctrine of the </font><font face="SPIonic">uperfuej</font><font size="6"> of our Lord's manhood the Eutychians made use of the Catholic expression `ut voluit.' vid. Athan. l.c.

<sup>256 </sup>At first sight it would seem as if S.

Its <i>direct</i> meaning is here, as usual, essence, though <i>indirectly</i> it comes to imply subsistence. He is speaking of that Divine Essence which, though also the Almighty Father's, is as simply and entirely the Word's as if it were only His. Nay, even when the Essence of the Father is spoken of in a sort of contrast to that of the Son, as in the phrase </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ousia ec ousiaj</font><font size="6">, harsh as such expressions are, it is not accurate to say that </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font size="6"> is used for subsistence or person, or that two </font><font face="SPIonic">ousiai</font><font size="6"> are spoken of (vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 52, note 8), except, that is, by Arians, as Eusebius, supr. <i>Ep.

<sup>257 </sup>This was the question which came into discussion in the Nestorian controversy, when, as it was then expressed, all that took place in respect to the Eternal Word as man, belonged to His <i>Person,</i> and therefore might be predicated of Him; so that it was heretical not to confess the Word's body (or the body of God in the Person of the Word), the Word's death (as Athan, in the text), the Word's exaltation, and the Word's, or God's, Mother, who was in consequence called <font face="SPIonic" size="6">qeotokoj</font><font size="6">, which was the expression on which the controversy mainly turned.

<sup>279 </sup>The word origin, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">arxh</font><font size="6">, implies the doctrine, more fully brought out in other passages of the Fathers, that our Lord has deigned to become an instrumental cause, as it may be called, of the life of each individual Christian For at first sight it may be objected to the whole course of Athan.'s argument thus;-What connection is there between the sanctification of Christ's manhood and ours? how does it prove that human nature is sanctified because a particular specimen of it was sanctified in Him? S. Chrysostom explains, <i>Hom. in</i> Matt. lxxxii. 5. And just before, `It sufficed not for Him to be made man, to be scourged, to be sacrificed; but He assimilates us to Him (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">anafurei eauton hmin</font><font size="6">), nor merely by faith, but really, has He made us His body.' Again, `That we are commingled (</font><font face="SPIonic">anakerasqwmen</font><font size="6">) into that flesh, not merely through love, but really is brought about by means of that food which He has bestowed upon us.' <i>Hom. in Joann.</i> 46. 3. And so S. Cyril writes against Nestorius: `Since we have proved that Christ is the Vine, and we branches as adhering to a communion with Him, not spiritual merely but bodily, why clamours he against us thus bootlessly, saying that, since we adhere to Him, not in a bodily way, but rather by faith and the affection of love according to the Law, therefore He has called, not His own flesh the vine, but rather the Godhead?' in <i>Joann.</i> lib. 10. Cap. 2. pp. 863, 4. And Nyssen, <i>Orat. Catech.</i> 37. Decoctâ quasi per ollam carnis nostrae cruditate, sanctificavit in aeternum nobis cibum carnem suam. Paulin. <i>Ep.</i> 23. Of course in such statements nothing <i>material</i> is implied; Hooker says, `The mixture of His bodily substance with ours is a thing which the ancient Fathers disclaim. Yet the mixture of His flesh with ours they speak of, to signify what our very bodies through mystical conjunction receive from that vital efficacy which we know to be in His, and from bodily mixtures they borrow divers similitudes rather to declare the truth than the manner of coherence between His sacred and the sanctified bodies of saints.' <i>Eccl. Pol.</i> v. 56. §10. But without some explanation of this nature, language such as S. Athanasius's in the text seems a mere matter of words. vid. infr. §50 fin.</font></p>

<sup>344 </sup>These tenets and similar ones were common to many branches of the Gnostics, who paid worship to the Angels, or ascribed to them the creation; the doctrine of their consubstantiality with our Lord arose from their belief in emanation.

It was the tendency of all the heresies concerning the Person of Christ to explain away or deny the Atonement. The Arians, after the Platonists, insisted on the pre-existing Priesthood, as if the incarnation and crucifixion were not of its essence. The Apollinarians resolved the Incarnation into a manifestation, Theod. <i>Eran.</i> i. The Nestorians denied the Atonement, <i>Procl. ad Armen.</i> p. 615.

<sup>50 </sup>The Arians considered that our Lord's Priesthood preceded His Incarnation, and belonged to His Divine Nature, and was in consequence the token of an inferior divinity. The notice of it therefore in this text did but confirm them in their interpretation of the words <i>made, &amp;c.</i> For the Arians, vid. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 69, 37.

<sup>213 </sup>The Second Person in the Holy Trinity is not a quality of attribute or relation, but the One Eternal Substance; not a part of the First Person, but whole or entire God; nor does the generation impair the Father's Substance, which is, antecedently to it, whole and entire God. Thus there are two Persons, in Each Other ineffably, Each being wholly one and the same Divine Substance, yet not being merely separate aspects of the Same, Each being God as absolutely as if there were no other Divine Person but Himself. Such a statement indeed is not only a contradiction in the terms used, but in our ideas, yet not therefore a contradiction in fact; unless indeed any one will say that human words can express in one formula, or human thought embrace in one idea, the unknown and infinite God.

<sup>248 </sup>Of course this line of thought consistently followed, leads to a kind of Pantheism; for what is the Supreme Being, according to it, but an ideal standard of perfection, the sum total of all that we see excellent in the world in the highest degree, a creation of our minds, without real objective existence? The true view of our Lord's titles, on the other hand, is that He is That properly and in perfection, of which in measure and degree the creatures partake from and in Him.

<sup>249 </sup><font face="SPIonic" size="6">kat' epinoian</font><font size="6">, in idea or notion. This is a phrase of very frequent occurrence, both in Athan. and other writers. We have found it already just above, and <i>de Syn.</i> 15. <i>Or.</i> i. 9, also <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2, 3. <i>de Sent. D.</i> 2, <i>Ep. Aeg</i> 12, 13, 14. It denotes our idea or conception of a thing in contrast to the thing itself. Thus, the sun is to a savage a bright circle in the sky; a man is a `rational animal,' according to a certain process of abstraction; a herb may be medicine upon one division, food in another; virtue may be called a mean; and faith is to one man an argumentative conclusion, to another a moral peculiarity, good or bad. In like manner, the Almighty is in reality most simple and uncompounded. without parts, passions, attributes, or properties; yet we speak of Him as good or holy, or as angry or pleased, denoting some particular aspect in which our infirmity views, in which also it can view, what is infinite and incomprehensible. That is, He is </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">kat' epinoian</font><font size="6"> holy or merciful, being in reality a Unity which is all mercifulness and also all holiness, not in the way of qualities but as one indivisible perfection; which is too great for us to conceive as It is.</font></p>

<sup>252 </sup>On this subject rid. <i>Orat.</i> iv. n. 2. Nothing is more remarkable than the confident tone in which Athan. accuses Arians as here, and [Marcellus] in <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2. of considering the Divine Nature as compound, as if the Catholics were in no respect open to such a charge. Nor are they; though in avoiding it, they are led to enunciate the most profound and ineffable mystery. Vid. <i>supr.</i> §33, n. 1. The Father is the One Simple Entire Divine Being, and so is the Son; They do in no sense share divinity between Them; Each is is <font face="SPIonic" size="6">oloj Qeoj</font><font size="6">. This is not ditheism or tritheism, for they are the same God; nor is it Sabellianism, for They are eternally distinct and substantive Persons; but it is a depth and height beyond our intellect, how what is Two in so full a sense can also in so full a sense be One, or how the Divine Nature does not come under number. vid. notes on <i>Orat.</i> iii. 27 and 36. Thus, `being uncompounded in nature,' says Athan. `He is Father of One Only Son.' <i>de Decr.</i> 11. In truth the distinction into Persons, as Petavius remarks, `avails especially towards the unity and simplicity of God.' vid. <i>de Deo,</i> ii. 4, 8.</font></p>

<sup>265 </sup>He says that it is contrary to all our notions of religion that Almighty God cannot create, enlighten, address, and unite Himself to His creatures immediately. This seems to be implied in saying that the Son was created for creation, illumination, &amp;c.; whereas in the Catholic view the Son is but that Divine Person who in the Economy of grace is creator, enlightener, &amp;c. God is represented all-perfect but acting according to a certain divine order. This is explained just below.

<sup>297 </sup>He seems here to say that it is both true that `The Lord created,' and yet that the Son was not created. Creatures alone are created, and He was not a creature. Rather something belonging or relating to Him, something short of His substance or nature, was created. However, it is a question in controversy whether even His Manhood can be called a creature, though many of the Fathers (including Athan. in several places) seem so to call it. On the whole it would appear, (1.) that if `creature,' like `Son,' be a <i>personal</i> term, He is not a creature; but if it be a word of <i>nature,</i> He is a creature; (2.) that our Lord is a creature in respect to the flesh (vid. <i>infr.</i> 47); (3.) that since the flesh is infinitely beneath His divinity, it is neither natural nor safe to call-Him a creature (cf. Thom. A. <i>Sum. Th.</i> iii. xvi. 8, `non dicimus, quod Aethiops est albus, sed quod est albus secundum dentes') and (4.) that, if the flesh is worshipped, still it is worshipped as in the Person of the Son, not by a separate act of worship. Cf. <i>infr. Letter 60. ad Adelph.</i> 3. Epiph. has imitated this passage, <i>Ancor.</i> 51. introducing the illustration of a king and his robe, &amp;c. </p>

Without meaning that the respective terms are synonymous, is it not plain that in a later phraseology this would have been, `not simply that He is in His Person a creature,' or `that His Person is created?' Athan.'s use of the phrase </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">ousia tou logou</font><font size="6"> has already been noticed, <i>supr.</i> i. 45, and passages from this Oration are given in another connexion, <i>supr.</i> p. 70, note 15. The term is synonymous with the Divine Nature as existing in the Person of the Word. [Cf.

It is observed, §8, note, how this line of teaching might be wrested to the purposes of the Apollinarian and Eutychian heresies; and, considering Athan.'s most emphatic protests against their errors in his later works, as well as his strong statements in <i>Orat.</i> iii. there is ho hazard in this admission. His ordinary use of </font><font face="SPIonic">anqrwpoj</font><font size="6"> for the manhood might quite as plausibly be perverted on the other hand into a defence of Nestorianism. Vid. also the Ed. Ben. on S. Hilary, praef. p. xliii. who uses <i>natura</i> absolutely for our Lord's Divinity, as contrasted to the <i>dispensatio,</i> and divides His titles into <i>naturalia</i> and <i>assumpta.</i></font></p>

<sup>315 </sup>Here he says that, though our Lord's flesh is created or He is created as to the flesh, it is not right to call Him a creature. This is very much what S. Thomas says, as referred to in §45, note 1, in the words of the Schools, that Aethiops, albus secundum dentes, non est albns. But why may not our Lord be so called upon the principle of the <i>communicatio Idiomatum</i> (<i>infr.</i> note on iii. 31.) as He is said to be born of a Virgin, to have suffered, &amp;c.? The reason is this:-birth, passion, &amp;c., confessedly belong to His human nature, without adding `according to the flesh;' but `creature' not implying humanity. might appear a simple attribute of His Person, if used without limitation. Thus, as S. Thomas adds, though we may not absolutely say Aethiops est albus, we may say `crispus est,' or in like manner, `calvus est.' Since crispus, or calvus, can but refer to the hair. Still more does this remark apply in the case of `Sonship,' which is a personal attribute altogether; as is proved, says Petav. <i>de Incarn.</i> vii. 6 fin. by the instance of Adam, who was in all respects a man like Seth, yet not a son. Accordingly, we may not call our Lord, even according to the manhood, an adopted Son.</p>

<sup>323 </sup>He says that, though none could be `a beginning' of creation, who was a creature, yet still that such a title belongs not to His essence. It is the name of an <i>office</i> which the Eternal Word alone can fill. His Divine Sonship is both superior and necessary to that office of a `Beginning.' Hence it is both true (as he says) that `if the Word is a creature, He is not a beginning;' and yet that that `beginning' is `in the number of the creatures.' Though He becomes the `beginning,' He is not `a beginning as to His essence,' vid. <i>supr.</i> i. 49, and <i>infr.</i> §60. where he says, `He who is before all, cannot be a beginning of all, but is other than all,' which implies that the beginning of all is not other than all. vid. §8, note 4, on the Priesthood, and §16, n. 7.</p>

<sup>357 </sup>Two ends of our Lord's Incarnation are here mentioned; that He might die for us, and that He might renew us, answering nearly to those specified in Rom. iv. 25. `who was delivered for our offences and raised again for our justification.' The general object of His coming, including both of these, is treated of in <i>Incarn.</i> esp. §§4-20. and in the two books against Apollinaris. Vid. <i>supr.</i> §8. §9. Also <i>infr. Orat.</i> iv. 6. And Theodoret, <i>Eran.</i> iii. p. 196, 7. Vigil. Thaps. <i>contr.</i> <i>Eutych.</i> i. p. 496. (B. P. ed. 1624.) and S. Leo speaks of the whole course of redemption, i.e. incarnation, atonement, regeneration, justification, &amp;c., as one sacrament, not drawing the line distinctly between the several agents, elements, or stages in it, but considering it to lie in the intercommunion of Christ's and our persons. <i>Serm.</i> 63. 14. He speaks of His fortifying us against our passions and infirmities, both <i>sacramento susceptionis</i> and exemplo. <i>Serm.</i> 65, 2. and of a duplex remedium cujus aliud in <i>sacramento,</i> aliud in exemplo. <i>Serm.</i> 67, 5. also 69, 5. The tone of his teaching is throughout characteristic of the Fathers, and very like that of S. Athanasius.</p>

<sup>364 </sup>The word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">autoj</font><font size="6">, `Himself,' is all along used, where a later writer would have said `His Person;' vid. <i>supr.</i> §45, n. 2; still there is more to be explained in this passage, which, taken in the letter, would speak a language very different from Athan.'s, as if the infirmities or the created nature of the Word were not more real than His imputed sinfulness. (vid. on the other hand <i>infr.</i> iii. 31-35). But nothing is more common in theology than comparisons which axe only parallel to a certain point as regards the matter in hand, especially since many doctrines do not admit of exact illustrations. Our Lord's real manhood and imputed sinfulness were alike adjuncts to His Divine Person, which was of an Eternal and Infinite Nature; and therefore His Manhood may be compared to an Attribute, or to an accident, without meaning that it really was either.</font></p>

<sup>409 </sup>Here again, though speaking of the `first-born of creation,' Athan. simply views the phrase as equivalent to `first-born of the <i>new</i> creation or <i>"brother"</i> of many;' and so <i>infr.</i> `first-born because of the brotherhood He has made with many.'</p>

<sup>425 </sup>It would be perhaps better to translate `first-born to the creature,' to give Athan.'s idea; <font face="SPIonic" size="6">thj ktisewj</font><font size="6"> not being a partitive genitive, or </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">prwtotokoj</font><font size="6"> a superlative (though he presently so considers it), but a simple appellative and </font><font face="SPIonic">thj kt</font><font size="6">. a common genitive of relation, as `the king of a country,' `the owner of a house.' `First-born of creation' is like `author, type, life of creation.' Hence S. Paul goes on at once to say, `for <i>in</i> Him all things were made,' not simply `by and for,' as at the end of the verse; or as Athan. says here, `because in Him the creation came to be.' On the distinction of </font><font face="SPIonic">dia</font><font size="6"> and </font><font face="SPIonic">en</font><font size="6">, referring respectively to the first and second creations, vid. <i>In illud Omn.</i> 2.

<sup>426 </sup>To understand this passage, the Greek idiom must be kept in view. Cf. Milton's imitation `the fairest of her daughters Eve.' Vid. as regards the very word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">prwtoj</font><font size="6">, John i. 15; and <i>supr.</i> §30, note 3, also </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">pleisthn h emprosqen</font><font size="6"> 3 Maccab. 7, 21. Accordingly as in the comparative to obviate this exclusion, we put in the word `other.' (ante 'alios immanior omnes), so too in the Greek superlative, `Socrates is wisest of "other" heathen.' Athanasius then says in this passage, that `first-born of creatures' implies that our Lord was not a creature; whereas it is not said of Him `first-born of brethren,' lest He should he excluded from men, but first-born "among" brethren,' where `among' is equivalent to `other.'</font></p>

<sup>9 </sup>Acts xvii. 28. Vid. <i>supr.</i> ii. 41, note 11. The doctrine of the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">perixwrhsij</font><font size="6">, which this objection introduces, is the test of orthodoxy opposed to Arianism. Cf. <i>de Syn.</i> 15, n. 4. This is seen clearly in the case of Eusebius, whose language approaches to Catholic more nearly than Arians in general. After all his strong assertions, the question recurs, is our Lord a distinct being from God, as we are, or not? he answers in the affirmative, vid. <i>supr.</i> p. 75, n. 7, whereas we believe that He is literally and numerically one with the Father, and therefore His Person dwells in the Father's Person by an ineffable union. And hence the language of Dionysius [of Rome] <i>supr. de Decr.</i> 26. `the Holy Ghost must repose and habitate in God,' </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">emfiloxwrein tw qew kai endiaitasqai</font><font size="6">. And hence the strong figure of S. Jerome (in which he is followed by S. Cyril, <i>Thesaur.</i> p. 51), `Filius locus eat Patris, sicut et Pater locus est Filii.' in Ezek. iii. 12. So Athan. contrasts the creatures who are </font><font face="SPIonic">en memerismenoij topoij</font><font size="6"> and the Son. <i>Serap.</i> iii. 4. Cf. even in the Macrostich Creed, language of this character, viz. `All the Father embosoming the Son, and all the Son hanging and adhering to the Father, and alone resting on the Father's breast continually.' <i>De Syn.</i> 26 (7), where vid. note 3. </font></p>

<sup>10 </sup>This is not inconsistent with S. Jerome as quoted in the foregoing note. Athan. merely means that such illustrations cannot be taken literally, as if spoken of natural subjects. The Father is the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">topoj</font><font size="6"> or locus of the Son, because when we contemplate the Son in His fulness as </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">oloj qeoj</font><font size="6">, we merely view the Father as that Person in whom God the Son is; our mind abstracts His Essence which is the Son for the moment from Him, and regards Him merely as Father, Thus <i>in</i> <i>Illud. Omn.</i> 4, <i>supr.</i> p. 89. It is, however, but an operation of the mind, and not a real emptying of Godhead from the Father, if such words may be used. Father and Son are both the same God, though really and eternally distinct from each other; and Each is full of the Other, that is, their Essence is one and the same. This is insisted on by S. Cyril, <i>in Joan.</i> p. 28. And by S. Hilary, <i>Trin.</i> vii. fin. vid. also iii. 23. Cf. the quotation from S. Anselm made by Petavius, <i>de Trin.</i> iv. 16 fin. [Cf. D.C.B. <i>s.v.</i> Metangismonitae.]</font></p>

<sup>24 </sup>Since the Father and the Son are the numerically One God, it is but expressing this in other words to say that the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father, for all They have and all They are is common to Each, excepting Their being Father and Son.

<sup>48 </sup>Athanasius guards against what is defective in this illustration in the next chapter, but independent of such explanation a mistake as to his meaning would be impossible; and the passage affords a good instance of the imperfect and partial character of all illustrations of the Divine Mystery. What it is taken to symbolize is the unity of the Father and Son, for the Image is not a Second Emperor but the same. vid. <i>Sabell. Greg.</i> 6. But no one, who bowed before the Emperor's Statue can be supposed to have really worshipped it; whereas our Lord is the Object of supreme worship, which terminates in Him, as being really one with Him whose Image He is. From the custom of paying honour to the Imperial Statues, the Cultus Imaginum was introduced into the Eastern Church. The Western Church, not having had the civil custom, resisted. rid. Döllinger, <i>Church History,</i> vol. 3. p. 55. E. Tr. The Fathers, e.g. S. Jerome, set themselves against the civil custom, as idolatrous, comparing it to that paid to Nebuchadnezzar's statue. vid. Hieron. in Dan. iii. 18. Incense was burnt before those of the Emperors; as afterwards before the images of the Saints.</p>

<sup>78 </sup>He says that in `I the first' the question of time does not come in, else creatures would come `second' to the Creator, as if His and their duration admitted of a common measure. `First' then does not imply succession, but is equivalent to <font face="SPIonic" size="6">arxh</font><font size="6">; a word which, as `Father,' does not imply that the Son is not from eternity.</font></p>

<sup>80 </sup>It is no inconsistency to say that the Father is first, and the Son first also, for comparison or number does not enter into mystery. Since Each is <font face="SPIonic" size="6">oloj qeoj</font><font size="6">, Each, as contemplated by our finite reason, at the moment of contemplation excludes the Other. Though we `say' Three Persons, Person hardly denotes one abstract `idea,' certainly not as containing under it three individual subjects, but it is a `term' applied to the One God in three ways. It is the doctrine of the Fathers, that, though we use words expressive of a Trinity, yet that God is beyond number, and that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, though eternally distinct from each other, can scarcely be viewed together in common, except as `One' substance, as if they could not be generalized into Three Any whatever; and as if it were, strictly speaking, incorrect to speak of `a' Person, or otherwise than of `the' Person, whether of Father, or of Son, or of Spirit. The question has almost been admitted by S. Austin, whether it is not possible to say that God is `One' Person (<i>Trin.</i> vii. 8), for He is wholly and entirely Father, and at the same time wholly and entirely Son, and wholly and entirely Holy Ghost. Some references to the Fathers shall be given on that subject, <i>infr.</i> 36 fin. vid. also <i>supr.</i> §6, n. 11. Meanwhile the doctrine here stated will account for such expressions as `God from God,' i.e. the One God (who is the Son) from the One God (who is the Father); vid. <i>supr. de Syn.</i> 52, note 8.

And Theodoret on Col. iii. 17. says, `Following this rule, the Synod of Laodicea, with a view to cure this ancient disorder, passed a decree against the praying to Angels, and leaving our Lord Jesus Christ.' `All supplication, prayer, intercession, and thanksgiving is to be addressed to the Supreme God, through the High Priest who is above all Angels, the Living.

As to the history of this title, Theodoret, who from his party would rather be disinclined towards it, says that the most ancient (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">twn palai kai propalai</font><font size="6">) heralds of the orthodox faith taught to name and believe the Mother of the Lord </font><font face="SPIonic">qeotokon</font><font size="6">, according to `the Apostolical tradition.' <i>Hoer.</i> iv. 12. And John of Antioch, whose championship of Nestorius and quarrel with S.

Eph.</i> part i. c. 25 (Labb.). Socrates <i>Hist.</i> vii. 32. says that Origen, in the first tome of his Comment on the Romans (vid. de la Rue in Rom. lib. i. 5. the original is lost), treated largely of the word; which implies that it was already in use. `Interpreting,' he says, `<i>how</i> </font><font face="SPIonic">qeotokoj</font><font size="6"> is used, he discussed the question at length.' Constantine implies the same in a passage which divines, e.g. Pearson (On the Creed, notes on <i>Art.</i> 3.), have not dwelt upon (or rather have apparently over-looked, in arguing from Ephrem. <i>ap.</i> Phot. <i>Cod.</i> 228, p. 776. that the literal phrase `Mother of God' originated in S. Leo). [See vol. 1, p. 569 of this Series.]</font></p>

<sup>129 </sup><font face="SPIonic" size="6">eidoj</font><font size="6">: also in Gen. xxxii. 30. Gen. xxxii. 31. Sept. [a substitute for Heb. `face.'] vid. Justin <i>Tryph.</i> 126. and <i>supr. de Syn.</i> 56, n. 6. for the meaning of the word. It was just now used for `kind.' Athan. says, <i>de Syn. ubi supr.</i> `there is but one form of Godhead;' yet the word is used of the Son as synonymous with `image.' It would seem as if there are a certain class of words, all expressive of the One Divine Substance, which admit of more appropriate application either ordinarily or under circumstances, to This or That Divine Person who is also that One Substance. Thus `Being' is more descriptive of the Father as the </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">phgh qeothtoj</font><font size="6">, and He is said to be `the Being of the Son;' yet the Son is really the One Supreme Being also. On the other hand the words </font><font face="SPIonic">morfh</font><font size="6"> and </font><font face="SPIonic">eidoj</font><font size="6"> [on them see Lightfoot, <i>Philipp.</i> p. 128] are rather descriptive of the Divine Substance in the Person of the Son, and He is called `the form of the Father,' yet there is but one Form and Face of Divinity, who is at once Each of Three Persons; while `Spirit' is appropriated to the Third Person, though God is a Spirit. Thus again S. Hippolytus says </font><font face="SPIonic">ek</font><font size="6"> [</font><font face="SPIonic">tou patroj</font><font size="6">] </font><font face="SPIonic">dunamij logoj</font><font size="6">, yet shortly before, after mentioning the Two Persons, he adds, </font><font face="SPIonic">dunamin de mian</font><font size="6">, <i>contr. Noet.</i> 7 and 11. And thus the word `Subsistence,' </font><font face="SPIonic">upostasij</font><font size="6">, which expresses the One Divine Substance, has been found more appropriate to express that Substance viewed personally. Other words may be used correlatively of either Father or Son; thus the Father is the Life of the Son, the Son the Life of the Father; or, again, the Father is in the Son and the Son in the Father. Others in common, as `the Father's Godhead is the Son's,' </font><font face="SPIonic">h patrikh uiou qeothj</font><font size="6">, as indeed the word </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font size="6"> itself. Other words on the contrary express the Substance in This or That Person only, as `Word,' `Image,' &amp;c.</font></p>

<sup>212 </sup>Cf. <i>de Decr.</i> 25, n. 4. The peculiarity of the Catholic doctrine, as contrasted with the heresies on the subject of the Trinity, is that it professes a mystery. It involves, not merely a contradiction in the terms used, which would be little, for we might solve it by assigning different senses to the same word, or by adding some limitation (e.g. if it were said that Satan was an Angel and not an Angel, or man was mortal and immortal), but an incongruity in the ideas which it introduces. To say that the Father is wholly and absolutely the one infinitely-simple God, and then that the Son is also, and yet that the Father is eternally distinct from the Son, is to propose ideas which we cannot harmonize together; and our reason is reconciled to this state of the case only by the consideration (though fully by means of it) that no idea of ours can embrace the simple truth, so that we are obliged to separate it into portions, and view it in aspects, and adumbrate it under many ideas, if we are to make any approximation towards it at all; as in mathematics we approximate to a circle by means of a polygon, great as is the dissimilarity between the two figures.

The same line of thought is implied throughout his proof of our Lord's eternity in <i>Orat.</i> i. ch. 4 6.

<sup>282 </sup><font face="SPIonic" size="6">palin</font><font size="6">. vid. <i>Or.</i> i. 15, n. 6. Thus iteration is not duplication in respect to God; though <i>how</i> this is, is the inscrutable Mystery of the Trinity in Unity. Nothing can be named which the Son is in Himself, as distinct from the Father; we are but told His <i>relation</i> towards the Father, and thus the sole meaning we are able to attach to Person is a relation of the Son towards the Father; and distinct from and beyond that relation, He is but the One God, who is also the Father. This sacred subject has been touched upon <i>supr. Or.</i> iii. 9, n. 8. In other words, there is an indestructible essential relation existing in the One Indivisible infinitely simple God, such as to constitute Him, viewed on each side of that relation (what in human language we call) Two (and in like manner Three), yet without the notion of number really coming in. When we speak of `Person,' we mean nothing more than the One God in substance, viewed relatively to Him the One God, as viewed in that Correlative which we therefore call another Person. These various statements are not here intended to explain, but to bring home to the mind <i>what</i> it is which faith receives. We say `Father, Son, and Spirit,' but when we would abstract a general idea of Them in order to number Them, our abstraction really does hardly more than carry us back to the One Substance. Such seems the meaning of such passages as Basil. <i>Ep.</i> 8, 2; <i>de Sp. S.</i> c. 18; Chrysost. <i>in Joan. Hom.</i> ii. 3 fin. `In respect of the Adorable and most Royal Trinity, `first' and `second' have no place; for the Godhead is higher than number and times.' Isid. <i>Pel. Ep.</i> 3, 18. Eulog. <i>ap.</i> Phot. 230. p. 864. August. <i>in Joan.</i> 39, 3 and 4; <i>de Trin.</i> v. 10. `Unity is not number, but is itselt the principle of all things.' Ambros. <i>de Fid.</i> i. n. 19. `A trine numeration then does not make number, which they rather run into, who make some difference between the Three.' Boeth. <i>Trin. unus Deus,</i> p. 959. The last remark is found in Naz. <i>Orat.</i> 31, 18. Many of these references are taken from Thomassin <i>de Trin.</i> 17.</font></p>

<sup>322 </sup>Though our Lord, as having two natures, had a human as well as a divine knowledge, and though that human knowledge was not only limited because human, but liable to ignorance in matters in which greater knowledge was possible; yet it is the doctrine of the [later] Church, that <i>in fact</i> He was not ignorant even in His human nature, according to its capacity, since it was from the first taken out of its original and natural condition, and `deified' by its union with the Word. As then (<i>supr.</i> ii. 45, note 1) His manhood was created, yet He may not be called a creature even in His manhood, and as (<i>supr.</i> ii. 14, note 5) His flesh was in its abstract nature a servant, yet He is not a servant in fact, even as regards the flesh; so, though He took on Him a soul which left to itself had been partially ignorant, as other human souls, yet as ever enjoying the beatific vision from its oneness with the Word, it never was ignorant really, but knew all things which human soul can know. vid. Eulog. <i>ap. Phot.</i> 230. p. 884. As Pope Gregory expresses it, `Novit in natura, non ex natura humanitatis.' <i>Epp.</i> x. 39. However, this view of the sacred subject was received by the Church only after S. Athanasius's day, and it cannot be denied that others of the most eminent Fathers seem to impute ignorance to our Lord as man, as Athan. in this passage. Of course it is not meant that our Lord's soul has the same perfect knowledge as He has as God. This was the assertion of a General of the Hermits of S. Austin at the time of the Council of Basel, when the proposition was formally condemned, animam Christi Deum videre tam clare et intense quam clare et intense Deus videt seipsum. vid. Berti <i>Opp.</i> t. 3. P. 42. Yet Fulgentius had said, `I think that in no respect was full knowledge of the Godhead wanting to that Soul, whose Person is one with the Word: whom Wisdom so assumed that it is itself that same Wisdom.' <i>ad Ferrand.</i> iii. p. 223. ed. 1639. Yet, <i>ad Trasmund.</i> i. 7. he speaks of ignorance attaching to our Lord's human nature.</p>

<sup>324 </sup>And so Athan. <i>ad Serap.</i> ii. 9. S. Basil on the question being asked him by S. Amphilochius, says that he shall give him the answer he had `heard from a boy from the fathers,' but which was more fitted for pious Christians than for cavillers, and that is, that `our Lord says many things to men in His human aspect; as "Give me to drink," ...yet He who asked was not flesh without a soul, but Godhead using flesh which had one.' <i>Ep.</i> 236, 1. He goes on to suggest another explanation which has been mentioned §42, note 1. Cf. Cyril <i>Trin.</i> pp. 623, 4. vid. also <i>Thes.</i> p. 220. `As he submitted as man to hunger and thirst, so.... to be ignorant." p. 221. vid. also Greg. Naz. <i>Orat.</i> 30, 15. Theodoret expresses the same opinion very strongly, speaking of a gradual revelation to the manhood from the Godhead, but in an argument where it was to his point to do so; in <i>Anath.</i> 4. t. v. p. 23. ed. Schulze. Theodore of Mopsuestia also speaks of a revelation made by the Word. ap. Leont. <i>c. Nest</i> (Canis. i. p. 579.)</p>

<sup>326 </sup>Leporius, in his Retractation, which S. Augustine subscribed, writes, `That I may in this respect also leave nothing to be cause of suspicion to any one, I then said, nay I answered when it was put to me, that our Lord Jesus Christ was ignorant as He was man, (secundum hominem). But now not only do I not presume to say so, but I even anathematize my former opinion expressed on this point,' <i>ap. Sirm.</i> t. i. p. 210. A subdivision also of the Eutychians were called by the name of Agnoetae from their holding that our Lord was ignorant of the day of judgment. `They said,' says Leontius, `that He was ignorant of it, as we say that He underwent toil.' <i>de Sect.</i> 5. circ. fin. Felix of Urgela held the same doctrine according to Agobard's testimony, see §46, n. 2. Montfaucon observes on the text, that the assertion of our Lord's ignorance `seems to have been condemned in no one in ancient times, unless joined to other error.' And Petavius, after drawing out the authorities for and against it, says, `Of these two opinions, the latter, which is now received both by custom and by the agreement of divines, is deservedly preferred to the former. For it is more agreeable to Christ's dignity, and more befitting His character and office of Mediator and Head, that is, Fountain of all grace and wisdom, and moreover of Judge, who is concerned in knowing the time fixed for exercising that function. In consequence, the former opinion, though formerly it received the countenance of some men of high eminence, was afterwards marked as a heresy.' <i>Incarn.</i> xi. 1. §15.</p>

<sup>332 </sup>It is a question to be decided, whether our Lord speaks of actual ignorance in His human Mind, or of the natural ignorance of that Mind considered as human; ignorance <i>in</i> or <i>ex</i> natura; or, which comes to the same thing, whether He spoke of a real ignorance, or of an economical or professed ignorance, in a certain view of His incarnation or office, as when He asked, `How many loaves have ye?' when `He Himself knew what He would do,' or as He is called sin, though sinless. Thus it has been noticed, <i>supr.</i> ii. 55, n. 7, that Ath. seems to make His infirmities altogether only imputative, not real, as if shewing that the subject had not in his day been thoroughly worked out. In like manner S. Hilary, who, if the passage be genuine, states so clearly our Lord's ignorance, <i>de Trin.</i> ix. fin. yet, as Petavius observes, seems elsewhere to deny to Him those very affections of the flesh to which he has there paralleled it. And this view of Athan.'s meaning is favoured by the turn of his expressions. He says such a defect belongs to `<i>that human nature</i> whose property it is to be ignorant;' §43. that `since He was made man, He is not <i>ashamed,</i> because of the flesh which is ignorant, <i>to say,</i> "I know not;"' ibid. and, as here, that `as <i>shewing</i> His manhood, in that to be ignorant is <i>proper</i> to man, and that He had <i>put on</i> a flesh <i>that was ignorant,</i> being in which, He <i>said</i> according to the flesh, "I know not;"' `that He might <i>shew</i> that as man He knows not;' §46. that `<i>as</i> man' (i.e. on the <i>ground</i> of being man, not in the <i>capacity</i> of man), `He knows not;' ibid. and that, `He <i>asks</i> about Lazarus humanly,' even when `He was <i>on His way</i> to raise him,' which implied surely knowledge in His human nature. The reference to the parallel of S. Paul's professed ignorance when he really knew, §47. leads us to the same suspicion. And so `for <i>our profit</i> as I think, did He this.' §§48-50. The natural want of precision on such questions in the early ages was shewn or fostered by such words as <font face="SPIonic" size="6">oikonomikwj</font><font size="6">, which, in respect of this very text, is used by S. Basil to denote both our Lord's Incarnation, <i>Ep.</i> 236, 1 fin. and His gracious accommodation of Himself and His truth, <i>Ep.</i> 8, 6. and with the like variety of meaning, with reference to the same text, by Cyril. <i>Trin.</i> p. 623. and <i>Thesaur.</i> p. 224. (And the word <i>dispensatio</i> in like manner, Ben. note on <i>Hil.</i> x. 8.) In the latter <i>Ep.</i> S. Basil suggests that our Lord `economizes by a reigned ignorance.' §6. And S. Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> p. 224. And even in <i>de Trin.</i> vi. he seems to recognise the distinction laid down just now between the natural and actual state of our Lord's humanity; and so Hilary, <i>Trin.</i> ix. 62. And he gives reasons why He professed ignorance, n. 67. viz. as S. Austin words it, Christum se dixisse nescientem, in quo alios facit occultando nescientes. <i>Ep.</i> 180, 3. S.

<sup>338 </sup>The mode in which Athan. here expresses himself, is as if he did not ascribe ignorance literally, but apparent ignorance, to our Lord's soul, vid. <i>supr.</i> 45. n. 2; not certainly in the broad sense in which heretics have done so. As Leontius, e.g. reports of Theodore of Mopsuestia, that he considered Christ `to be ignorant so far, as not to know, when He was tempted, who tempted Him;' <i>contr. Nest.</i> iii. (Canis. t. i. p. 579.) and Agobard of Felix the Adoptionist that he held `Our Lord Jesus Christ according to the flesh <i>truly</i> to have been ignorant of the sepulchre of Lazarus, when He said to his sisters, `Where have ye laid him?' and was <i>truly</i> ignorant of the day of judgment; and was <i>truly</i> ignorant what the two disciples were saying, as they walked by the way, of what had been done at Jerusalem; and was <i>truly</i> ignorant whether He was more loved by Peter than by the other disciples, when He said, `Simon Peter, Lovest thou Me more than these?' <i>B.

<sup>364 </sup>It is the doctrine of the [medieval and modern] Church that Christ, as man, was perfect in knowledge from the first, as if ignorance were hardly separable from sin, and were the direct consequence or accompaniment of original sin. Cf. Aug. <i>de Pecc. Mer.</i> ii. 48.

<sup>372 </sup>It is remarkable, considering the tone of his statements in the present chapter, that here and in what follows Athan. should resolve our Lord's advance in wisdom merely to its gradual manifestation through the flesh [but he says expressly `the Manhood advanced in wisdom!'] and it increases the proof that his statements are not to be taken in the letter, and as if fully brought out and settled. Naz. says the same, <i>Ep. ad Cled.</i> 101. p. 86. which is the more remarkable since he is chiefly writing against the Apollinarians, who considered a <font face="SPIonic" size="6">fanerwsij</font><font size="6"> the great end of our Lord's coming; and Cyril. <i>c.

<sup>408 </sup>It is observable that, as elsewhere we have seen Athan. speak of the <i>nature</i> of the Word, and of, not the <i>nature</i> of man as united to Him, but of <i>flesh, humanity,</i> &amp;c. (vid. <i>Or.</i> ii. 45, n. 2.) so here, instead of speaking of two wills, he speaks of the Word's <i>willing</i> and human <i>weakness, terror,</i> &amp;c. In another place he says still more pointedly, `The <i>will</i> was of the Godhead alone; since the whole <i>nature</i> of the Word was manifested in the second Adam's <i>human form</i> and visible <i>flesh.</i> contr. Apoll. ii. 10. Cf. S. Leo on the same passage: `The first request is one of infirmity, the second of power; the first He asked in our [character], the second in His own. ...The inferior will give way to the superior,' &amp;c. <i>Serm.</i> 56, 2. vid. a similar passage in Nyssen. <i>Antirrh. adv. Apol.</i> 32. vid. also 31. An obvious objection may be drawn from such passages, as if the will `of the flesh' were represented as contrary (vid. foregoing note) to the will of the Word. The whole of our Lord's prayer is offered by Him as man, because it is a prayer; the first part is not from Him as man, but the second, which corrects it, from Him as God [i.e. the first part is not human <i>as contrasted</i> with the second]; but the former part is from the sinless infirmity of our nature, the latter from His human will expressing its acquiescence in His Father's, that is, in His Divine Will. `His Will,' says S. Greg. Naz. `was not contrary to God, being all deified, <font face="SPIonic" size="6">qewqen olon</font><font size="6">.'</font></p>

It is remarkable that he ends as be began, with reference to the ecclesiastical scope, or <i>Regula Fidei,</i> which has so often come under our notice, vid. <i>Or.</i> ii. 35. n. 2. 44, n. 1, as if distinctly to tell us, that Scripture did not so force its meaning on the individual as to dispense with an interpreter, and as if his own deductions were not to be viewed merely in their own logical power, great as that power often is, but as under the authority of the Catholic doctrines which they subserve.

<sup>447 </sup>Two distinct meanings may be attached to `by will' (as Dr. Clark observes, <i>Script. Doct.</i> p. 142. ed. 1738), either a concurrence or acquiescence, or a positive act. S Cyril uses it in the former sense, when he calls it <font face="SPIonic" size="6">sundromoj</font><font size="6">, as quoted §60, n. 1; and when he says (with Athan. <i>infr.</i>) that `the Father wills His own subsistence, </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">qelhghj esti</font><font size="6">, but is not what He is from any will, </font><font face="SPIonic">ek boulhsewj</font><font size="6">,' <i>Thes.</i> p. 56; Dr. Clark would understand it in the latter sense, with a view of inferring that the Son was subsequent to a Divine act, i.e. not eternal; but what Athan. says leads to the conclusion, that it does not matter which sense is taken. He does not meet the Arian objection, `if not by will therefore by necessity,' by speaking of a concomitant will, or merely saying that the Almighty exists or is good, by will, with S. Cyril, but he says that `nature <i>transcends</i> will and necessity also.' Accordingly, Petavius is even willing to allow that the </font><font face="SPIonic">ek boulhj</font><font size="6"> is to be ascribed to the </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhsij</font><font size="6"> in the sense which Dr. Clark wishes, i.e. he grants that it may precede the </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhsij</font><font size="6">, i.e. in <i>order,</i> not in time, in the succession of our ideas, <i>Trin.</i> vi. 8, §§20, 21; and follows S. Austin, <i>Trin.</i> XV. 20. in preferring to speak of our Lord rather as voluntas de voluntate, than, as Athan. is led to do, as the voluntas Dei.</font></p>

<sup>488 </sup><font size="6">The above <i>Excursus</i> is substituted for the longer introduction of Newman (republished in Latin in his <i>Tracts, Theological and Ecclesiastical,</i> 1872), and is in the main a condensation of the more recent and final discussion of Zahn (<i>Marcellus,</i> 1867, pp. 198 <i>seqq.</i>). The result of the latter is to confirm the main contention of Newman, viz. that the system, rather than the person, of Marcellus is throughout in view. Earlier discussions pointing the same way are cited: `In Eusebii contra Marcellum libros Observationes, auctore K.S.C.,' Lips. 1787 (cited by Newman); Rettberg, <i>Marcelliana,</i> Praef. p. 7; Kuhn, <i>Kathol. Dogm.</i> ii. p. 344, note 1 (by Zahn). </font></p>

<sup>53 </sup>Cf. <i>Orat.</i> i. §§2-5; <i>de Sent. D.</i> 6; Socr. i. 9. The Arian Philostorgius tells us that `Arius wrote songs for the sea and for the mill and for the road, and then set them to suitable music,' <i>Hist.</i> ii. 2. It is remarkable that Athanasius should say the <i>Egyptian</i> Sotades, and again in <i>Sent. D.</i> 6. There were two Poets of the name; one a writer of the Middle Comedy, <i>Athen. Deipn.</i> vii. 11; but the other, who is here spoken of, was a native of Maronea in Crete, according to Suidas (<i>in voc.</i>), under the successors of Alexander, <i>Athen.</i> xiv. 4. He wrote in Ionic metre, which was of infamous name from the subjects to which he and others applied it. vid. <i>Suid.</i> ibid. Horace's Ode. `Miserarum est neque amori, &amp;c.' is a specimen of this metre, and some have called it Sotadic; but Bentley shews <i>in loc.</i> that Sotades wrote in the Ionic a majore. Athenaeus implies that all Ionic metres were called Sotadic, or that Sotades wrote in various Ionic metres. The Church adopted the Doric music, and forbade the Ionic and Lydian. The name `Thalia' commonly belonged to convivial songs; Martial contrasts the `lasciva Thalia' with `carmina sanctiora,' <i>Epigr.</i> vii. 17. vid. Thaliarchus, `the master of the feast,' Horat. Od. i. 9. [The metre of the fragments of the `Thalia' is obscure, there are no traces of the Ionic foot, but very distinct anapaestic cadences. In fact the lines resemble ill-constructed or very corrupt anapaestic tetrameters catalectic, as in a comic <i>Parabasis.</i> For Sotades, the Greek text here reads corruptly Sosates.]</p>

<sup>65 </sup>Bull considers that the doctrine of such Fathers is here spoken of as held that our Lord's <font face="SPIonic" size="6">sugkatabasij</font><font size="6"> to create the world was a </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">gennhsij</font><font size="6">, and certainly such language as that of Hippol. <i>contr.

Again, Athanasius, <i>Orat.</i> iv. 15, says that, of those who divide the Word from the Son, some called our Lord's manhood the Son, some the two Natures together, and some said `that the Word Himself became the Son when He was made man.' It makes it more likely that Marcellus is meant, that Asterius seems to have written against him before the Nicene Council, and that Arius in other of his writings borrowed from Asterius. vid. <i>de Decret.</i> §8.</font></p>

<sup>91 </sup>It need Scarcely be said, that `perfect from perfect' is symbol on which the Catholics laid stress. Athan. <i>Orat.</i> ii. 35. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 76. p. 945. but it admitted of an evasion. An especial reason for insisting on it in the previous centuries had been the Sabellian doctrine, which considered the title `Word' when applied to our Lord to be adequately explained by the ordinary sense of the term, as a word spoken by us. In consequence they insisted on His <font face="SPIonic" size="6">to teleion</font><font size="6">, perfection, which became almost synonymous with His personality. (Thus the Apollinarians, e.g. denied that our Lord was <i>perfect</i> man, because His <i>person</i> was not human. Athan. <i>contr. Apoll.</i> i. 2.) And Athan. condemns the notion of 'the </font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">logoj en tw qew atelhj, gennhqeij teleioj</font><font size="6">, Orat. iv. 11. The Arians then, as being the especial opponents of the Sabellians, insisted on nothing so much as our Lord's being a real, living, substantial, Word. vid.

The Semi-Arians were more open to this imputation; Eusebius, as we have seen above, distinctly calling our Lord a second and another God. vid. p. 75, note 7. It will be observed that this Anathema contradicts the one which immediately follows, and the 11th, in which Christ is called God; except, on the one hand the Father and Son are One God, which was the Catholic doctrine, or, on the other, the Son is God in name only, which was the pure Arian or Anomoean.</p>

<sup>125 </sup>The language of Catholics and heretics is very much the same on this point of the Son's ministration, with this essential difference of sense, that Catholic writers mean a ministration internal to the divine substance and an instrument connatural with the Father, and Arius meant an external and created medium of operation. Thus S. Clement calls our Lord `the All-harmonious Instrument (<font face="SPIonic" size="6">organon</font><font size="6">) of God.' <i>Protrept.</i> p. 6; Eusebius `an animated and living instrument (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">organon emyuxon</font><font size="6">), nay, rather divine and vivific of every substance and nature.' <i>Demonstr.</i> iv. 4. S. Basil, on the other hand, insists that the Arians reduced our Lord to `an inanimate instrument,' </font><font face="SPIonic">organon ayuxon</font><font size="6">, though they called Him </font><font face="SPIonic">upourgon teleiotaton</font><font size="6">, most perfect minister or underworker. <i>adv. Eunom.</i> ii. 21. Elsewhere he makes them say, `the nature of a cause is one, and the nature of an instrument, </font><font face="SPIonic">organou</font><font size="6">, another; .... foreign then in nature is the Son from the Father, since such is an instrument from a workman.' <i>De Sp. S.</i> n. 6 fin. vid. also n. 4 fin. 19, and 20. And so S.

Orat. 30. 11. Cf. S. Cyril, <i>in Joann.</i> p. 48.

Augustine seems to have been the first who changed the mode of viewing the texts in question, and considered the divine appearance, not God the Son, but a created Angel. Vid. <i>de Trin.</i> ii. <i>passim.</i> Jansenius considers that he did so from a suggestion of S.

<sup>140 </sup>It will be observed that this Confession; 1. by denying `two Gods,' and declaring that the One God is the God of Christ, implies that our Lord is not God. 2. It says that the word `substance,' and its compounds, ought not to be used as being unscriptural, mysterious, and leading to disturbance; 3. it holds that the Father is greater than the Son `in honour, dignity, and godhead;' 4. that the Son is subordinate to the Father <i>with</i> all other things; 5. that it is the Father's characteristic to be invisible and impassible. They also say that our Lord, hominem suscepisse per quem <i>compassus</i> est, a word which Phoebadius condemns in his remarks on this Confession; where, by the way, he uses the word `spiritus' in the sense of Hilary and the Ante-Nicene Fathers, in a connection which at once explains the obscure words of the supposititious Sardican Confession (vid. above, §9, note 3), and turns them into another evidence of this additional heresy involved in Arianism. `Impassibilis Deus,' says Phoebadius, `quia Deus <i>Spiritus</i> ... non ergo passibilis Dei Spiritus, licet in homine suo passus.' Now the Sardican Confession is thought ignorant, as well as unauthoritative, e.g. by Natalis Alex. <i>Saec.</i> 4. <i>Diss.</i> 29, because it imputes to Valens and Ursacius the following belief, which he supposes to be Patripassianism, but which exactly answers to this aspect and representation of Arianism: <font face="SPIonic" size="6">oti o logo= kai oti to pneuma kai estaurwqh kai esfagh kai apeqanen kai anesth</font><font size="6">.

<sup>179 </sup>It is usual with the Fathers to use the two terms `Son' and `Word,' to guard and complete the ordinary sense of each other, vid. p. 157, note 6; and p. 167, note 4. The term Son, used by itself, was abused into Arianism; and the term Word into Sabellianism; again the term Son might be accused of introducing material notions, and the term Word of imperfection and transitoriness. Each of them corrected the other. <i>Orat.</i> i. §28. iv. §8. Euseb. <i>contr. Marc.</i> ii. 4. p. 54. Isid. Pel. <i>Ep.</i> iv. 141. So S.

However, S Athanasius observes, that properly speaking the one term implies the other, i.e. in its fulness. <i>Orat.</i> iii. §3. iv. §24 fin. On the other hand the heretics accused Catholics of inconsistency, or of a union of opposite errors, because they accepted all the Scripture images together. Vigilius of Thapsus, <i>contr.

<sup>187 </sup>Cf. Soz. iii. 18. The heretical party, starting with the notion in which their heresy in all its shades consisted, that the Son was a distinct being from the Father, concluded that `<i>like</i> in essence' was the only term which would express the relation of the Son to the Father. Here then the word `coessential' did just enable the Catholics to join issue with them, as exactly expressing what the Catholics wished to express, viz. that there was no such distinction between Them as made the term `like' necessary, but that as material parent and offspring are individuals under one common <i>species,</i> so the Eternal Father and Son are Persons under one common <i>individual essence.</i></p>

That word, then, is pronounced by Lightf., partly on the strength of the quotation from the unnamed teachers (<i>infr.</i> note 7), partly on the ground of a reference to §26 (see note 10 there), to be </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font size="6">. With all deference to so great an authority, I cannot hesitate to pronounce for </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6">. (1.) The parallelism of the two senses with the third and fourth senses of </font><font face="SPIonic">agen</font><font size="6">. <i>Orat.</i> i. 30. is almost decisive by itself. (2.) Ath.'s explanation of Ignatius. viz. that Christ is </font><font face="SPIonic">genhtoj</font><font size="6"> <i>on account of the flesh</i> (he would have referred </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhtoj</font><font size="6"> to His Essence, Orat. i. 56, certainly not to the flesh), while as Son and Word He is distinct from </font><font face="SPIonic">genhta</font><font size="6"> and </font><font face="SPIonic">poihmata</font><font size="6">, is even more decisive. (3.) His explanation §46, <i>sub fin.</i> that the Son is </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6">. because He is </font><font face="SPIonic">aidion gennhma</font><font size="6"> would lose all sense if </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font size="6">. were read. As a matter of fact, </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font size="6">. is the specific, </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6">. the generic term: the former was not applicable to the Eternal Son; the latter was, except in the first of the two senses distinguished in the text: a sense, however, more properly coming under the specific idea of </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhto</font><font size="6">. This was the ambiguity which made the similarity of the two words so dangerous a weapon in Arian hands. The above note does not of course affect the true reading of Ign. <i>Eph.</i> 7, as to which Lightfoot and Zahn speak with authority: but it seems clear that Athan., however mistakenly, <i>quotes</i> Ign. with the reading </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font size="6">.]</font></p>

<sup>51 </sup>Auxentius (not in D.C.B.) was a native of Cappadocia (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 75), and had been ordained presbyter at Alexandria by Gregory (next note). Upon the expulsion of the somewhat weak-kneed Dionysius after the council at Milan (355) he was appointed to that see by Constantius, although according to Athanasius (<i>ubi supr.</i>) he knew no Latin, nor any thing else except irreligion (`a busybody rather than a Christian'). He took a leading part along with Valens and others at the Council of Ariminum (<i>de Syn.</i> 8, 10) and was included in the deposition of Arian leaders by that synod. Under the orthodox Valentinian he maintained his see in spite of the efforts of Philaster, Evagrius, and Eusebius of Vercellae, and in spite of the condemnations passed upon him by various Western synods (362-371, see <i>ad Epict.</i> 1). In 364, Hilary travelled to Milan on purpose to expose him before Valentinian. In a discussion ordered by the latter, Hilary extorted from Auxentius a confession which satisfied the Emperor, but not Hilary himself, whose persistent denunciation of its insincerity caused his dismissal from the town. Auxentius seems after this to have intrigued to obtain Illyrian signatures to the creed? (Niké or Ariminum (Hard. <i>Conc.</i> 1. pp. 771. 773). Upon his death (374) Ambrose was elected bishop of Milan, but was confronted by the Arian party with a rival bishop in the person of a second Auxentius, said to have been a pupil of Ulfilas.</p>

<sup>44 </sup>We should not have much difficulty in fixing upon many of the phrases and expressions used by S. Athan. towards the close of his Epistles, by referring to the concluding sentences in the Paschal Letters of S. Cyril, who seems herein to have closely imitated his illustrious predecessor in the Patriarchate. The Syriac translator must frequently have had before him the following expressions: <font face="SPIonic" size="6">arxomenoi thj agiaj tessarakosthj&lt;\episunaptontej&lt;\sunaptontej echj&lt;\periluontej taj nhsteiaj&lt;\katapauontej taj nhsteiaj&lt;\espera baqeia sabbatou&lt;\th epifwskoush kuriakh</font><font size="6">. </font></p>

<sup>2 </sup>There is sometimes a difficulty, in the absence of independent testimony, in ascertaining the exact orthography of the proper names, from the loose manner in which they are written in the Syriac. Here, however, it is clearly Hyginus, as in Sozomen, lib. ii. c. 25, Larsow writes it Eugenius. He has also the 46th instead of the 48th of the Diocletian Aera. The word `Fabius' is not clear.

<sup>1 </sup>The text is difficult; possibly the Syriac translator is responsible for the difficulty. But we know from Ath. (<i>supr.</i> p. 273) that the reappointment of Philagrius was in the express interest of the Arians: it is, therefore, probable that Theodorus was not unfavourable to Athanasius.

In the Syriac text, as published by Mr. Cureton, as well as in the German translation by Larsow, there, is a hiatus, here, the next two or three pages, as far as the words `He wept,' (§5 <i>init.</i>) being wanting. Two more leaves were afterwards discovered among the fragments in the British Museum by the learned Editor. One of tavern belongs to this part; the other to the eleventh Letter.</p>

<sup>4 </sup>Larsow writes `Ilius.' Tanis is situate in Augustamnica Prima. Vid. Quatremère <i>Mémoires geogr. et histor. sur l'Egypte,</i> tom. i. p, 284, &amp;c. (L.) The word <font face="SPIonic" size="6">Tanij</font><font size="6"> is the LXX. rendering of `Zoan.' In the <i>Apol. c. Ar.</i> 50, we have a list of ninety-four Egyptian Bishops, among others, who subscribed to the letter of the Council of Sardica. A reference to this list explains some names which otherwise would have been obscure. For a list of the Egyptian Bishoprics, the reader is referred to Neale's <i>Hist. of the Holy Eastern Church.</i> Gen. Introd. vol. i. pp. 115, 116. To the list there given must be added the names of Butolia, Stathma, the Eastern Garyathis, the Southern Garyathis. There were two Egyptian Bishops named Elias who subscribed their names to the letter of the Council of Sardica.</font></p>

<sup>33 </sup>Observe that Athan. gives notice notice at <i>Easter,</i> a.d. 344, upon what day Easter is to be observed in a.d. 345, and not immediately after the succeeding Epiphany, as Cassian asserts to have been the custom of the Patriarch of Alexandria.

<sup>2 </sup>The 14th day of the Moon, reckoning from the time of <i>mean</i> New Moon, took place on Sunday the 23rd. According to the rule which obtained in later times and continued in use until the Gregorian reformation of the Calendar, the 14th day of the <i>Ecclesiastical</i> Moon took place on Saturday the 22nd, which would make Easter-day happen on the 23rd. It would seem, therefore, that the decision of the Synod referred to, brought the Ecclesiastical Moon into closer accordance with that of the heavens, than the later Calendar would have done. In 357 Easter was apparently kept on Mar. 23.</p>

<sup>7 </sup>The following fragment (Migne, <i>ib.</i> p. 1189), was published by Montfaucon from a Colbertine Latin ms. of about 800 a.d. He conjectured that it belonged to a Festal Letter. On this hypothesis, which is, however, as Mai observes, by no means self-evident, we append it to the above fragments of <i>Letter</i> 29, since internal evidence connects it with the handing over of the churches at Alexandria to the partisans of George, June, 356. At any rate, in spite of the heading of the fragment, its beginning is clearly not preserved. </p>

<sup>1 </sup>This section is preserved in the Coptic (Memphitic) Life of S. Theodore (Amálineau <i>Ann. du Musée Guimet.</i> xvii. p. 239). Its contents and the context in which it is quoted appear decisive for its identification as part of <i>Letter</i> 39. But the Letter from which the fragment comes is stated in the context to have been received by Theodore in the spring previous to his death. If Theodore died in 364, as seems probable on other grounds (see p. 569, note 3), the speech from which our fragment comes must have been written for him by his biographer. This is not unlikely, nor does it throw any suspicion on the genuineness of the fragment itself.</p>

<sup>3 </sup>The remainder of the thirty-ninth Letter has long been before the world, having been preserved, with the heading of the Letter, in the original Greek, by Theodorus Balsamon. It may be found in the first volume of the Benedictine edition of the works of S. Athan. tom. i. p. 767. ed. 1777. [Migne, <i>ubi supra</i>]. A Syriac translation of it was discovered by Cureton in an anonymous Commentary on the Scriptures in the collection of the British Museum (<i>Cod.</i> 12, 168). This translation commences only at the quotation from S. Luke. The Syriac is apparently the work of a different translator.</p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">This and the following letters were first printed by Scipio Maffei from a Latin ms. in the Chapter Library of Verona, along with the <i>Historia Acephala.</i> They were included in Galland, <i>Bibl. Patr.</i> vol. 5, and in Justiniani's Ed. of Athanasius (Padua, 1777). The letters are printed in Migne, xxvi. 1333, <i>sqq.,</i> along with one (from the same source) addressed by the Council to the Mareotic Churches. Hefele doubts their genuineness, but without reason (ii. 166, <i>E. Tra.</i>) The list of signatures (an independent source of information, <i>supr.</i> p. 147) alone proves the contrary. The two letters may be taken as a supplement to the documents given, <i>Apol. c. Ar.</i> 37-50 (see also p. 147), with which they have many points of resemblance. The Latin is very bad and occasionally without sense; it bears clear traces of being a rendering by an unskilful hand from Greek.</font></p>

At any rate, Athanasius addresses his correspondent as `elder' and `father,' which accords well with the language of <i>Vit. Ant. ubi supr.</i> The letter states clearly Athanasius' opinion as to the relative value of the celibate and married state. It also shews the healthy good sense of the great bishop in dealing with the morbid scrupulosity which even at that early date had begun to characterise certain circles in the Monastic world.</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">Dracontius, Bishop of Hermupolis Parva, was one of the bishops expelled from their sees, 356-7. His place of exile was the desert near `Clysma,' i.e. the gulf of Suez (<i>Hist. Ar.</i> 75, cf. Hieron. <i>Vit. Hilar.</i> 30). We find him in 362 at the Council of Alexandria. The present letter, written to urge Dracontius not to refuse the Episcopate, was written just before Easter (§10), when persecution was expected (§3), and after the mission of Serapion, Ammonius and others to Constantius, a.d. 353. It was probably written, therefore, early either in 354 or 355. The letter is one of the masterpieces of Athanasius: its unforced warmth, vigour, and affection can fail to touch no one who reads it. It is, like the letter to Amun, one of our most important documents for the history of Egyptian Monasticism. (Migne xxv. 524 <i>sqq.</i>)</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">Lucifer, bishop of Calaris (Cagliari) in Sardinia, exiled by Constantius after the Council of Milan (Prolegg. ch. ii. §7), first to Germanicia, then to Eleutheropolis in Palestine, at both of which places he was subjected to harsh treatment, lastly to the Thebaid. The violence of his advocacy of the Nicene faith, coupled with extreme personal abusiveness, may have aggravated his sufferings. On his part in the events of 362, see Prolegg. ch. ii. §9. The present letters exist only in Latin (Migne xxvi. 1181), and are probably a translation from the Greek. Athan. may have known Latin, but there is no evidence that he ever wrote in that language. The play on the name Lucifer in <i>Letter</i> 51 proves nothing to the contrary. Dr. Bright (in D.C.B. i. 198, note) expresses a doubt as to the genuineness of our letters which is I think unsupported by internal evidence. The main difficulty is in the reconciliation of the apparent references (51 init.) to the events of 356 as recent with the clear references to the <i>de Athanasio</i> and <i>Moriendum pro Filio Dei</i> of Lucifer, neither of which works were penned before 358, while the latter in its final form mentions the translation of Eudoxius to CP., and therefore falls as late as 360 (for proof of this, see Krüger, <i>Lucifer,</i> pp. 102-109). But on close examination, the language of <i>Letter</i> 51 is satisfied by the events of 359, the vindictive commission of Paul Catena and the search for Athanasius among the Monasteries (cf. <i>Letter</i> 53, note 1). The respectful reference to Constantius in <i>Letter</i> 50 is of a purely formal character. The reference to the parents of Athanasius as still living is of great interest as one of the very few notices of the family of the great bishop (Prolegg. ch. ii. §1). The agitated tone of the Epistles reminds us of the <i>Arian History,</i> and they may be set down to about the year 359. On Lucifer, the monograph of Krüger is the standard authority.</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">This short letter, like those to Lucifer, was printed at first in Latin, evidently the almost servile rendering of a Greek original. The latter was discovered by Montfaucon after the completion of the Benedictine edition, and printed in his `Nova Collectio Patrum' (1706). (Migne xxvi. 1185.)</font></p>
<p><img src="http://jennica.github.io/fathers/schaff/pix/mroonspm.gif"/></p>
<p>The date is fixed <i>a parte post</i> in an interesting manner. We read in the Life of Pachomius, §88 (the story is also found in the Coptic documents in the collection of Zoega p. 36), that when Duke Artemius came to the monastery of Pabau in search of Athanasius, the steward of the community replied, `Although Athanasius is our Father under God, we have never seen his face.' The Duke answered by a request for the prayers of the brethren before he left. The `abbat Psarphi' replied that the `Father' had forbidden the monks to pray with strangers who consorted with the Arians,-a clear allusion to the letter before us. Now Duke Artemius was in search of Athanasius in 359-60 (<i>Fest. Ind.</i>). Accordingly our letter was issued before that date.</p>
<p>The Greek text is evidently imperfect: the square brackets in the translation denote passages supplied from the Latin. The first part of the letter (down to the words `along with' ...) is preserved in a contemporary inscription (Boeckh. C.I G. iv. 8607) on the walls of an ancient Egyptian tomb at Abd-el-Kurna, which in those later days had become a monastic cell. The remainder is effaced. (See Fialon, p. 134, who has failed to notice the identity of the inscription with our present letter.)</p>

<sup>1 </sup>On this letter (Migne xxv. 686) in relation to other writings, see above, <i>Letter</i> 52, note 1, and pp. 267, 268. Serapion would seem to have been the right-hand man of Athan. among the bishops of Egypt. The dates of his birth and episcopate are not certain, but the tone of the letters to him imply that he is junior to Athanasius. The theory of Ceillier, based on a precarious inference from the words of an untrustworthy writer (Philip of Side) that <i>this</i> Serapion (the name was very common) had presided over the catechetical school before Peter, i.e. at the end of the third century, is quite out of the question. Moreover, no Serapion appears among the Egyptian bishops at Tyre in 335 (p. 142), but the name occurs among the Alexandrian <i>presbyterate</i> of the same date (pp. 139, 140), while two bishops of the name sign the Sardican decrees (p. 127). It is then not unlikely that Athan, selected Serapion for the very important (Amm. Marc. xxii. 16) see of Thmuis in the Delta between 337 and 339 (<i>supr. Letter</i> 12, note 1). In 353 the trusted suffragan is chosen for a difficult and perilous mission to Constantius (<i>supr.</i> pp. 497, 504). For some reason we miss his name from the list of exiles in 356-7 (pp. 257, 297), nor is he named as present at the `Council of Confessors' in 362. During the third exile, however, Ath. addressed to him our present letter, and an important dogmatic treatise (Prolegg. ch. iii. §1, no. 22). Serapion was a friend and legatee of S. Antony (<i>supr.</i> p. 220). The date of Serapion's death is not known, but he is said to have been living after 368 (Leont. <i>adv. fraud.

<sup>1 </sup>This letter (Migne xxvi. 1180) deals with one of the questions which occupied the council of 362 (<i>supr.</i> p. 481), and was probably written not long after, although the contents furnish no precise terminus <i>ad quem.</i> The personality and see of Rufinianus are uncertain. The latter must have been distant from Alexandria: the Coptic documents call him `Rufinus the archbishop,' which seems to place him outside Egypt. The mention of Eudoxius and Euzoius <i>sub. fin.</i> possibly points to Syria. I suspect that he is the `Lucinianus' associated with `Eusebius' (of Vercellae?) in the little fragment (4) quoted in note 7 below, which comes from a letter of Ath. dealing with the same subject. The Coptic `Acts' of Revillout, p. 462 (as referred to <i>supr.</i> p. 188) give part of a letter of Rufinianus himself, which shews that the correspondence of which our letter is the principal relic bore on the Christological decision of the Council of 362: `Sound is the idea of perfection for the Divinity, as for the Economy of the Manhood: Sound is the doctrine of the Divinity in a single essence. Pure, and wholesome for the souls of the faithful, is the Confession of the Holy Triad. Perfect then is the Economy of the Manhood of the Saviour, and Perfect is His Soul also; nothing is lacking to Him. It is thus that It was manifested to us.'</p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">Cf. Prolegg, ch. ii. §9, and ch. v. §3, h. and <i>supr.</i> p. 487. Athanasius, on the first news of Julian's death, by a secret and rapid journey, succeeded in meeting Jovian, when still beyond the Euphrates on his return from the East. He thus secured the ear of the new Emperor before the Arian deputation from Alexandria could reach him. The letter before us (Migne xxvi. 813) was drawn up at Antioch, as it would seem in response to a request from Jovian on a doctrinal statement. The short letter of Jovian prefixed to the Epistle is a formal authorisation for the bishop's return to his see, with which, taught by his experience under Julian, he was careful to arm himself. The documents given as an appendix are notes made at Antioch, and carefully preserved, of the reception given by Jovian to the Arian deputation. They are probably the `exemplaria' referred to in <i>Hist. Aceph.</i> §14 (see note there). They are characteristic, and interesting in many ways; among others, as shewing how accurately Jovian had been primed by Athanasius with the leading facts of his case.</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup>On Theodore see Amelineau, <i>S. Pakhdôme,</i> &amp;c., pp. xcv.-xcvii. The death of Theodore is fixed for April 27, 364, on the following grounds. He died (<i>Vit. Pachom.</i> 95) of a short and sudden illness, on Pachon 2 (April 27), and shortly after Easter. Moreover his death took place 18 years after that of Pachomius. But Ammon (as he tells us himself, <i>supr.</i> p. 487) became a Christian and a monk `a year and more' after March 15, 351 (proclamation of Gallus as Caesar), and six years after the death ot Pachomius. (<i>Ep. Amm.</i> 4, 5.) This dates the latter event <i>a little less than five years before</i> March 15, 351. But Pachomius died, according to his <i>Life,</i> on Pachon 14 (May 9), of an epidemic which attacked the community after Easter. This double condition is satisfied by the year 346, in which Easter fell on Pharm. 4, forty days before the day of Pachomius' decease. If then Pachomius died in 346, Theodore died in 364. Against this result we have (1) the fact that in that year April 27 was twenty-three days after Easter; but the Easter gathering of the monks would last over April 11 (Low Sunday), and the death of Theodore would come suddenly enough a fortnight later; (2) the fragment (<i>supr.</i> p. 551) probably belonging to Letter 39, which a coptic life of Theodore makes him state that he received before his last Easter. But this cannot be correct; for all known data forbid us to place the death of Theodore as late as 367. (Tillemont's tentative opinion, vii. 691, 761, is bound up with an obsolete chronology of the exiles of Athan.) On the other hand Theodore cannot have died as early as 363. Athanasius was with him (<i>supr.</i> p. 487) in the summer of that year, and when our present letter was written Ath. had clearly kept Easter at home, which suits 364, but excludes 363.</p>

<sup>1 </sup>Of Epictetus, bishop of Corinth, nothing else is known. This letter reflects the uncertainty, which attended the victory of the Nicene Creed, as to the relation of the Historical Christ to the Eternal Son. The questions raised at Corinth were those which troubled the Eastern Church generally, and which came to a head in the system of Apollinarius, whose distinctive tenet, however, is not mentioned in this letter. Persons anxious to place the Nicene doctrine in intelligible connection with the matter of the Gospel Narrative had debated the question before Epictetus, and with deference to his ruling. Their tentative solutions (§2 <i>infr.</i>) fall into two classes, both of which, in attempting to solve the problem, proceed upon the assumption incidentally combated by Athan., that the Manhood of Christ was a Hypostasis or Person, which if invested with Divine attributes, would introduce a fourth hypostatic entity into the Trinity. To avoid this, one class identified the Logos and the <font face="SPIonic" size="6">#Anqrwpoj</font><font size="6">, either by assuming that the Logos was changed into flesh, or that the flesh was itself non-natural and of the Divine Essence. The other class excluded the Man Jesus from the Trinity, explaining His relation to God on the lines of Photinus or the later Nestorians. Both alternatives are already glanced at (<i>supr.</i> p. 485) by the Council of 362. In the present case, both classes of suggestions seem to have been made tentatively and <i>bona fide</i> (§12). The letter must have been written before the two books against Apollinarianism, which (if genuine) fall about 372. Its more exact date depends on the identification of the Councils referred to in §1 (</font><font face="SPIonic" size="+0">nun genomenwn</font><font size="6">), and is therefore very doubtful. At any rate Apollinarianism proper is not alluded to, and Apollinarius is said to have expressed to Serapion of Thmuis his high opinion of our Letter (see <i>Letter</i> 54, note 1). It was much quoted in the Christological controversies of the next 80 years, e.g. by the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon, by Theodoret, Cyril, and Leo the Great (see Migne xxvi. 1050; Bright, <i>Later Treatises,</i> pp. 43 <i>sq.</i>, and D.C.B. s.v. Epictetus and Apollinaris the younger).</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">Adelphius is named in the `Tome' (above, p. 486), as bishop of Onuphis. Previously he had been exiled by the Arians to the Thebaid (above, pp. 297, &amp;c.). Hence in the title of this letter he is styled `Confessor.' The letter (Migne xxvi, 1072) is directed against the Arian Christology. Although Ath. treats it (§1) as a `<i>new</i> blasphemy,' it had been held by the Arians from the first; Epiph. <i>Anc.</i> 33, traces it back to Lucian; but doubtless it had by this time been brought more to the front in their teaching. We know that it occupied a prominent place in the Eunomian system. (References in Dorner III. i. 3.) After briefly refuting the doctrinal error, Athanasius turns to the Arian charge of creature-worship brought against the Nicene doctrine. Not forgetting to remind them that their own doctrine was really open to this charge, Ath. points out at greater length that the object of Catholic worship is not the human nature of Christ as such, but the Word Incarnate; and that the human Saviour is worshipped because He is the Word Himself. The date proposed by Montfaucon is adopted, though there is nothing to fix it absolutely. Its style closely resembles that of the writings of the `third Exile.' (See also Bright, Later Tr., p. 61.)</font></p>

<sup>1 </sup>Maximus, probably the Cynic philosopher who plays so strange and grotesque a part in the history of S. Gregory Nazianzen's tenure of the see of Constantinople (the identification is questioned by Bright, p. 72, but without very cogent reasons), was the son of Alexandrian parents, persons of high social standing, who had suffered much for the Faith. He himself was an ardent opponent of Arianism and heathenism, and was banished under Valens (further particulars in <i>Dict. Gr. and Rom. Biogr.</i> s. v. Maximus Alexandrinus). The present letter compliments him on his success in refuting heretics, some of whom advocated the Arian Christology; others the doctrine of Paul of Samosata and Photinus. The Epistle has much in common with those to Epictetus and Adelphius; Montfaucon's date tor it is adopted. (see Migne xxvi. 1085; Bright, <i>Lat. Tr.</i>, p. 72.)</p>

<sup>1 </sup><font size="6">Of John and Antiochus nothing is known, unless the latter is the later bishop of Ptolemais and enemy of Chrysostom. Both men seem to belong to the class of well-meaning mischief-makers, given to retailing invidious stories. Hence the polite reserve of our little note (Migne xxvi. 115, and its laconic dismissal of the gossip about Basil, the new bishop of the Cappadocian Caesarea (<i>supr.</i> p. 449). The main interest of this and the following letter, which seem to date from the winter 371-372, consists in the testimony of the high esteem of Athanasius for Basil, as well as his indifference to words where no essential principle was involved. The two recipients of this letter either lived or were visitors at Jerusalem. On Basil's difficulties at this time, see D.C.B. i. 288 a, 293, and on his relations with Athan., cf.

<sup>1 </sup>This fragment (Migne xxvi. 1261) is given by Facundus, <i>Def. Tr. Cap.</i> iv. 2, who claims it as addressed to Diodorus of Tarsus, the famous Antiochene confessor and master of Chrysostom and Theodore. Unfortunately this is impossible, as Diodore became bishop of Tarsus not before 378, i.e. after Athan. was dead. The letter itself decides for Diodorus <i>of Tyre,</i> whom Paulinus of Antioch had quite unwarrantably ordained to this see (cf. Rufin, <i>H.E.</i> ii. 21). Whether (as has been held on the authority of Rufinus) Diodorus, or (as Le Quien, <i>Or. Chr.</i> ii. 865 <i>sq.</i> holds) Zeno, the nominee of Meletius, was first in the field in the unseemly scramble, is doubtful. Zeno is already bishop in 365 (Soz. vi. 12); the date of the appointment of Diodorus, whose claim is at any rate no better than that of Paulinus himself, is quite uncertain (see also Prolegg. ch. ii. §§9, 10). Diodorus was the friend and correspondent of Epiphanius, and of Timothy, bishop of Alexandria, second from Athanasius. Facundus confuses him in these particulars also with his namesake of Tarsus, but the mistake is thoroughly sifted by Tillemont, <i>Mem.</i> viii. pp. 238, 712. The letter is important, along with <i>Letter</i> 56, and the correspondence of S. Basil, as illustrating the attitude of Athanasius with regard to the unhappy schism of Antioch.</p>
