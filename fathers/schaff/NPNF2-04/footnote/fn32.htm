<sup>11 </sup>Or ungodliness, <font face="SPIonic">aqeothtoj</font><font>. Thus Aetius was called </font><font face="SPIonic">o aqeoj</font><font>, the ungodly. <i>de Synod.</i> §6; and Axius complains that Alexander had expelled him and his from Alexandria, </font><font face="SPIonic">wj anqrwpouj aqeouj</font><font>. Theodor. Hist. i. 4. "Atheism" and "Atheist" imply intention, system, and profession, and are so far too strong a rendering of the Greek. Since Christ was God, to deny Him was to deny God. The force of the term, however, seems to be, that, whereas the Son had revealed the "unknown God," and destroyed the reign of idols, the denial of the Son was bringing back idolatry and its attendant spiritual ignorance. Thus <i>contr. Gent.</i> §29. fin. he speaks of "the Greek idolatry as full of all Atheism" or ungodliness, and contrasts with it the knowledge of "the Guide and Framer of the Universe, the Father's Word," "that through Him `we may discern His Father,' and the Greeks may know `how far they have separated themselves from the truth.'" And <i>Orat.</i> ii. 43. he classes Arians with the Greeks, who "though they have the name of God in their mouths, incur the charge of `Atheism,' because they know not the real and true God, `the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.'" (vid. also Basil in <i>Eunom.</i> ii. 22.) Shortly afterwards he gives a further reason for the title, observing that Arianism was worse than previous heresies, such as Manicheism, inasmuch as the latter denied the Incarnation, but Arianism tore from God's substance His connatural Word, and, as far as its words went, infringed upon the perfections and being of the first Cause. And so ad <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> §17. fin. he says, that it alone, beyond other heresies, "has been bold against the Godhead Itself in a mad way (</font><font face="SPIonic">manikwteron</font><font>, vid. foregoing note), denying that there is a Word, and that the Father was always Father." Elsewhere he speaks more generally, as if Arianism introduced "an Atheism or rather Judaism `against the Scriptures,' being next door to Heathenism, so that its disciple cannot be even named Christian; for all such tenets are `contrary to the Scriptures;'" and he makes this the reason why the Nicene Fathers stopped their ears and condemned it. ad <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> §13. For the same reason he calls the heathen </font><font face="SPIonic">aqeoi</font><font>, atheistical or ungodly, "who are arraigned of irreligion by Divine Scripture." <i>contr. Gent.</i> §14. vid. </font><font face="SPIonic">eidwlwn aqeothta</font><font>. §46. init. Moreover, he calls the Arian persecution worse than the pagan `cruelties,' and therefore "a Babylonian Atheism," <i>Ep. Encycl.</i> §5. as not allowing the Catholics the use of prayer and baptism, with a reference to Dan. vi. 11, &amp;c. Thus too he calls Constantius at heist, for his treatment of Hosius; </font><font face="SPIonic">oute ton qeon fobhqeij o aqeoj</font><font>. <i>Hist. Arian.</i> 45. Another reason for the title seems to have lain in the idolatrous character of Arian worship `on its own shewing,' viz. as worshipping One whom they yet maintained to be a creature. [Prolegg. ch. it. §3 (2)a, <i>sub. fin.</i>]</font></p>

He draws it out at length, <i>Orat. ii. §34</i>. Elsewhere, he uses the image for the evil influences introduced into the soul upon Adam's fall, <i>contr. Apoll.</i> i. §15. as does S. Irenaeus, <i>Haer.</i> iv. 40. n. 3. using it of such as lead to back-sliding in Christians. ibid. v. 10. n. 1.

<sup>16 </sup>The Council did two things, anathematise the Arian positions (at the end of the Creed), and establish the true doctrine by the insertion of the phrases, "of the substance" and "one in substance." Athan. says that the Arians must not criticise the latter before they had cleared themselves of the former. Thus he says presently, that they were at once irreligious in their faith and ignorant in their criticism; and speaks of the Council negativing their formulae, and substituting those which were "sound and ecclesiastical." vid. also n. 4.</p>

Leo "passim" concerning the Council of Chalcedon, "Concord will be easily established, if the hearts of all concur in that faith which, &amp;c., no discussion being allowed whatever concerning any retractation," Ep <i>Ep.</i> 94. He calls such an act a "magnum sacrilegium," <i>Ep.</i> 157. c. 3.

Again, "though the diabolical men rave" <i>Orat.</i> iii. §8. "friends of the devil, and his spirits," Ad <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> 5.

<sup>33 </sup>Vid. Orat. i. §38. The controversy turned on the question what was meant by the word `Son.' Though the Arians would not allow with the Catholics that our Lord was Son <i>by nature,</i> and maintained that the word implied <i>a beginning of existence,</i> they did not dare to say that He was Son merely in the sense in which we are sons, though, as Athan. contends, they necessarily tended to this conclusion, directly they receded from the Catholic view. Thus Arius said that He was a creature, `but not as one of the creatures.' <i>Orat.</i> ii. §19. Valens at Ariminum said the same, Jerom. adv. Lucifer. 18. Hilary says, that not daring directly to deny that He was God, the Arians merely asked `whether He was a Son.' <i>de Trin.</i> viii. 3. Athanasius remarks upon this reluctance to speak out, challenging them to present `the heresy naked,' <i>de Sent. Dionys.</i> 2. init. `No one,' he says elsewhere, `puts a light under a bushel; let them shew the world their heresy naked.' <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> 18. vid. ibid. 10. In like manner, Basil says that (though Arius was really like Eunomius, in faith, contr. <i>Eunom.</i> i. 4) Aetius his master was the first to teach openly (<font face="SPIonic">fanerwj</font><font>), that the Father's substance was unlike, </font><font face="SPIonic">anomoioj</font><font>, the Son's. ibid. i. 1. Epiphanius <i>Haer.</i> 76 p. 949. seems to say that the elder Arians held the divine generation in a sense in which Aetius did not, that is, they were not so consistent and definite as he. Athan. goes on to mention some of the attempts of the Arians to find some theory short of orthodoxy, yet short of that extreme heresy, on the other hand, which they felt ashamed to avow.</font></p>

<sup>59 </sup>His argument is, that if the Son but partook the Father in the sense in which we partake the Son, then the Son would not impart to us the Father, but Himself, and would be a separating as well as uniting medium between the Father and us; whereas He brings us so near to the Father, that we are the Father's children, not His, and therefore He must be Himself one with the Father, or the Father must be in Him with an incomprehensible completeness. vid. <i>de Synod.</i> §51. <i>contr. Gent.</i> 46. fin. Hence S. Augustin says, `As the Father has life in Himself, so hath He given also to the Son to have life in Himself, <i>not by participating,</i> but in Himself. For we have not life in ourselves, but in our God. But that Father, who has life in Himself, begat a Son such, as to have life in Himself, not to become partaker of life, but <i>to be Himself life; and of that life to make us partakers.</i> Serm. 127. de Verb.

<sup>66 </sup>The force lies in the word <font face="SPIonic">fusei</font><font>, `naturally,' which the Council expressed still more definitely by `essence.' Thus Cyril says, `the term "Son" denotes the essential origin from the Father.' Dial 5. p. 573. And Gregory Nyssen, `the title "Son" does not simply express the being from another' vid. infra. §19.), but <i>relationship according to nature. contr. Eunom.</i> ii. p. 91. Again S.

<sup>68 </sup>One of the characteristic points in Athanasius is his constant attention to the <i>sense</i> of doctrine, or the <i>meaning</i> of writers, in preference to the words used.

Hence infr. §18. he says, that orthodox doctrine `is revered by all though expressed in strange language, provided the speaker means religiously, and wishes to convey by it a religious sense.' vid. also §21. He says, that Catholics are able to `speak freely,' or to expatiate, </font><font face="SPIonic">parrhsiazomeqa</font><font>, `out of Divine Scripture.' <i>Orat.</i>i §9. §9. vid. <i>de Sent. Dionys.</i> §20. init. Again: `The devil spoke from Scripture, but was silenced by the Saviour; Paul spoke from profane writers, yet, being a saint, he has a religious meaning.' <i>de Syn.</i> §39, also ad <i>Ep. ¦g.</i> 8. Again, speaking of the apparent contrariety between two Councils, `It were unseemly to make the one conflict with the other, for all their members are fathers; and it were profane to decide that these spoke well and those ill, for all of them have slept in Christ.' §43. also §47. Again: `Not the phrase, but the meaning and the religious life, is the recommendation of the faithful.' ad <i>Ep. ¦g.</i> §9.</font></p>

<sup>70 </sup>Vid. also <i>Incarn.</i> §17. This contrast is not commonly found in ecclesiastical writers, who are used to say that God is present everywhere, in substance as well as by energy or power. S. Clement, however, expresses himself still more strongly in the same way, `In substance far off (for how can the originate come close to the Unoriginate?), but most close in power, in which the universe is embosomed.' <i>Strom. 2. circ. init.</i> but the parenthesis explains his meaning. Vid. Cyril. <i>Thesaur.</i> 6. p. 44. The common doctrine of the Fathers is, that God is present everywhere in <i>substance.</i> Vid. Petav. <i>de Deo,</i> iii. 8. and 9. It may be remarked, that S. Clement continues `<i>neither enclosing nor enclosed.</i>'</p>

<sup>71 </sup>6 In Almighty God is the perfection and first pattern of what is seen in shadow in human nature, according to the imperfection of the subject matter; and this remark applies, as to creation, so to generation. Athanasius is led to state this more distinctly in another connection in <i>Orat.</i> i. §21. fin. `It belongs to the Godhead alone, <i>that the Father is properly</i> (<font face="SPIonic">kuriwj</font><font>) <i>Father, and the Son properly</i> (</font><font face="SPIonic">kuriwj</font><font>) <i>Son;</i> and in Them and Them only does it hold that the Father is ever Father, and the Son ever Son.' Accordingly he proceeds, shortly afterwards, as in the text, to argue, `<i>For God does not make men His pattern,</i> but rather we men, for that God <i>is properly</i> and alone truly Father of His own Son, are also called fathers of our own children, for "of Him is every father-hood in heaven and on earth named,"' §23. The Semiarians at Ancyra quote the same text for the same doctrine. Epiphan. <i>Haer.</i> 73. 5. As do Cyril in <i>Joan.</i> i. p. 24. <i>Thesaur.</i> 32. p. 281. and Damascene <i>de Fid. Orth.</i> i. 8. The same parallel, as existing between creation and generation is insisted on by Isidor. Pel. <i>Ep.</i> iii. 355. Basil <i>contr. Eun.</i> iv. p. 280 A., Cyril <i>Thesaur.</i> 6. p. 43. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 69. 36. and Gregor. Naz. <i>Orat.</i> 20. 9. who observes that God creates with a <i>word,</i> Ps. cxlviii. 5, which evidently transcends human creations. Theodorus Abucara, with the same object, draws out the parallel of life, </font><font face="SPIonic">zwh</font><font>, as Athan. that of being, </font><font face="SPIonic">einai</font><font>. <i>Opusc.</i> iii. p. 420-422.</font></p>

<sup>73 </sup>S. Cyril, <i>Dial</i> iv. init. p. 505 E. speaks of the qrulloumeh, and disclaims it, <i>Thesaur.</i> 6. p. 43. Athan. disclaims it, <i>Expos.</i> §1. <i>Orat.</i> i. §21. So does Alexander, ap. Theod. <i>Hist.</i> i 3. p. 743. On the other hand, Athanasius quotes it in a passage which he adduces from Theognostus, <i>infr.</i> §25. and from Dionysius, <i>de Sent. D.</i> §23. and Origen uses it, <i>Periarchon,</i> i. 2. It is derived from Wisd. vii. 25.</p>

<sup>75 </sup>The title `Word' implies the ineffable mode of the Son's generation, as distinct from <i>material</i> parallels, vid. Gregory Nyssen, <i>contr. Eunom.</i> iii. p. 107. Chrysostom in <i>Joan.Hom.</i> 2. §4. Cyril Alex. <i>Thesaur.</i> 5. p. 37. Also it implies that there is but <i>One</i> Son. vid. infr. §16. `As the Origin is one essence, so its Word and Wisdom is one, essential and subsisting.' <i>Orat,</i> iv. 1. fin.</p>

<sup>76 </sup>`Man,' says S. Cyril, `inasmuch as he had a beginning of being, also has of necessity a beginning of begetting, as what is from him is a thing generate, but. ...if God's essence transcend time, or origin, or interval, His generation too will transcend these; nor does it deprive the Divine Nature of the power of generating, that it doth not this in time. For other than human is the manner of divine generation; and together with God's existing is His generating implied, and the Son was in Him by generation, nor did His generation precede His existence, but He was always, and that by generation.' <i>Thesaur.</i> v. p. 35. </p>

He is impassibly and indivisibly Father of the Son ...for ...the Word and Wisdom is neither creature, nor part of Him Whose Word He is, nor an offspring passibly begotten.' <i>Orat.</i> i. §28.</p>
