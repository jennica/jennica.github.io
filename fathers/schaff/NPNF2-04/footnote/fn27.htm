He was at the Council of Jerusalem ten years after, at which the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was consecrated, and afterwards Arius admitted to communion.

<sup>64 </sup>Vito and Vincentius, Presbyters, had represented Silvester at Nicaea. Liberius sent Vincentius, Bishop, and Marcellus, Bishop, to Constantius; and again Lucifer, Bishop, and Eusebius, Bishop. [The practice was common to all bishops, not peculiar to that of Rome.] S. Basil suggests that Damasus should send legates into the East, Ep. 69. The Council of Sardica, Can. 5, recognised the Pope's power of sending legates into foreign Provinces to hear certain appeals; "ut de <i>Latere suo</i> Presbyterum mittat." [It <i>conferred</i> the power (1) upon Julius (2) without any right of initiative, in Can. 3; Can. 5 simply regulates the exercise of the power thus conferred. The genuineness of these Canons has been disputed: at Rome they were quoted in the fifth century as `Nicene.'] vid. Thomassin. <i>de Eccl. Disc.</i> Part I. ii. 117.

<sup>68 </sup>By Danius, which had been considered the same name as Dianius, Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, Montfaucon <i>in loc.</i> understands the notorious Arian Bishop of Nicaea, called variously Diognius (supr. §13.) Theognius (infr §28.), Theognis (Philost. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 7.) Theogonius, (Theod. <i>Hist.</i> i. 19.), and assigns some ingenious and probable reasons for his supposition. [`Danius' was the Bishop of Caesarea in Cappad., he also signs at Philippopolis. See D.C.B. under Dianius and Basil.] Flacillus, Arian Bishop of Antioch, as Athan. names him, is called Placillus (in S. Jerome's <i>Chronicon,</i> p. 785.), Placitus (Soz. iii. 5.), Flacitus (Theod. <i>Hist.</i> i. 21.). Theodorus was Arian Bishop of Heraclea, whose Comments on the Psalms are supposed to be those which bear his name in Corderius's Catena. [He was not a thorough Arian.]</p>
<p><a name="P2753_1042841"></a>
<sup>69 </sup>Some of the topics contained in the Eusebian Letter are specified in Julius's answer. It acknowledged, besides, the high dignity of the [church] of Rome, as being a "School (<font face="SPIonic">frontisthrion</font><font>) of Apostles and a Metropolis of orthodoxy from the beginning," but added that "doctors came to it from the east; and they ought not themselves to hold the second place, for they were superior in virtue, though not in their Church." And they said that they would hold communion with Julius if he would agree to their depositions and substitutions in the Eastern Sees. Soz. iii. 8.</font></p>

<sup>71 </sup>As this determination does not find a place among the now received Canons of the Council, the passage in the text becomes of great moment in the argument in favour of the twenty Canons extant in Greek being but a portion of those passed at Nicaea. vid. Alber. <i>Dissert. in Hist. Eccles.</i> vii. Abraham Ecchellensis has argued on the same side (apud Colet. <i>Concil.</i> t. ii. p. 399. Ed. Ven. 1728), also Baronius, though not so strongly, Ann. 325. nn. 157 &amp;c. and Montfaucon <i>in loc.</i> Natalis Alexander, Saec. 4. <i>Dissert.</i> 28 argues against the larger number, and Tillemont, <i>Mem.</i> vi. 674. [But it is far more likely that Julius is making a free use of Can. Nic. 5; the Arabic canons are apparently referred to in the above note: no one now defends them.] </p>

<sup>72 </sup>The number of the Fathers at the Nicene Council is generally considered to have been 318, the number of Abraham's servants, Gen. xiv. 14. Anastasius (<i>Hodeg.</i> 3. fin.) referring to the first three Ecumenical Councils, speaks of the faith of the 318, the 150, and the 200. [Prolegg. ch. ii. §3 (1).]</p>
