<sup>105 </sup>The Pseudo-Sardican Council, i.e. that of Philippopolis, retort this accusation on the party of Marcellus; Hilar. <i>Fragm.</i> iii. 9. but the character of the outrages fixes them on the Arians, vid. infr. §45, note [There were doubtless outrages on both sides].</p>

<sup>111 </sup>Coustant <i>in loc.</i> fairly insists on them word "all," as shewing that S. Julius does not here claim the prerogative of judging <i>by himself</i> all Bishops whatever, and that what follows relates merely to the Church of Alexandria.</p>

<sup>113 </sup>Socrates says somewhat differently, "Julius wrote back .... that they acted against the Canons, because they had not called him to a Council, the Ecclesiastical Canon commanding that the Churches ought not to make Canons beside the will of the Bishop of Rome." Hist. ii. 17. Sozomen in like manner, "for it was a sacerdotal law, to declare invalid whatever was transacted beside the will of the Bishop of the Romans." Hist. iii. 10. vid. Pope Damasus ap. Theod. Hist. v. 10. Leon. Epist. 14. &amp;c. In the passage in the text the prerogative of the Roman see is limited, as Coustant observes, to the instance of Alexandria; and we actually find in the third century a complaint lodged against its Bishop Dionysius with the Pope. [Prolegg. ch. iv. §4.]</p>

Pearson, Vind. Ignat. p. 298. Hence Coustant in col. Athan. would suppose Julius to refer to 1 Cor. v. 4. which Athan. actually quotes, <i>Ep. Encycl.</i> §2. supr. p. 93. Pearson, <i>loc. cit.</i> considers the </font><font face="SPIonic">diataceij</font><font> of the Apostles, as a collection of regulation and usages, which more or less represented, or claimed to represent, what may be called St. Paul's <i>rule,</i> or St. Peter's <i>rule,</i> &amp;c.

<sup>138 </sup>Asclepas, or Asclepius of Gaza, Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 69. 4. was one of the Nicene Fathers, and according to Theod. <i>Hist.</i> i. 27. was at the Council of Tyre, which Athan. also attended, but only by compulsion. According to the Eusebians at Philippopolis, they had deposed him [17 years previously, but the number must be corrupt, or the statement incorrect]. They state, however, at the same time, that he had been condemned by Athanasius and Marcellus, vid. Hilar. <i>Fragm.</i> iii. 13. Sozomen, <i>Hist.</i> iii. 8. says that they deposed him on the charge of having overturned an altar; and, after Athan. <i>infr.</i> §47, that he was acquitted at Sardica on the ground that Eusebius of Caesarea and others had reinstated him in his see (before 339). There is mention of a Church built by him in Gaza ap. Bolland. Febr. 26. Vit. L. Porphyr. n. 20. p. 648. </p>

<sup>139 </sup>Perhaps Lucius of Hadrianople, says Montfaucon, referring to Apol. <i>de Fug.</i> §3. vid. also <i>Hist. Arian.</i> 19.</p>
<p><a name="P2877_1115489"></a>
<sup>140 </sup>Theodulus, Bishop of Trajanopolis in Thrace, who is here spoken of as deceased, seems to have suffered this persecution from the Eusebians upon their retreat from Sardica, vid. Athan. <i>Hist. Arian.</i> §19. We must suppose then with Montfaucon, that the Council, from whom this letter proceeds, sat some considerable time after that retreat, and that the proceedings spoken of took place in the interval. Socrates, however, makes Theodulus survive Constans, who died 350. <i>H. E.</i> ii. 26.</p>
<p><a name="P2878_1116346"></a>
<sup>141 </sup>The usual proceeding of the Arians was to retort upon the Catholics the charges which they brought against them, supr. §33, note 4. Accordingly, in their Encyclical from Philippopolis, they say that "a vast multitude had congregated at Sardica, of wicked and abandoned persons, from Constantinople and Alexandria; who lay under charges of murder, blood, slaughter, robbery, plunder, spoiling, and all nameless sacrileges and crimes; who had broken altars, burnt Churches, ransacked private houses," &amp;c. &amp;c.
