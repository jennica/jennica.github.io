<sup>107 </sup>Matt. iii. 17.</p>

<sup>108 </sup>Here is taught us the strict unity of the Divine Essence. When it is said that the First Person of the Holy Trinity communicates divinity to the Second, it is meant that that one Essence which is the Father, also is the Son. Hence the force of the word <font face="SPIonic">omoousion</font><font>, which was in consequence accused of Sabellianism, but was distinguished from it by the particle </font><font face="SPIonic">omou</font><font>, `together,' which implied a difference as well as unity; whereas </font><font face="SPIonic">tautoousion</font><font> or </font><font face="SPIonic">sunousion</font><font> implied, with the Sabellians, an identity or a confusion. The Arians, on the other hand, as in the instance of Eusebius, &amp;c., supr. p. 75, note 7; <i>de Syn.</i> 26, note 3; considered the Father and the Son two </font><font face="SPIonic">ousiai</font><font>. The Catholic doctrine is that, though the Divine Essence is both the Father Ingenerate and also the Only-begotten Son, it is not itself </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font> or </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhth</font><font>; which was the objection urged against the Catholics by Aetius, Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 76. 10. Cf. <i>de Decr.</i> §30, <i>Orat.</i> iii. §36 fin., <i>Expos. Fid.</i> 2. vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 45, note 1. `Vera et aeterna substantia in se tota permanens, totam se coaeternae veritati nativitatis indulsit.' Fulgent. <i>Resp.</i> 7. And S.

It must not be supposed from these instances that the Fathers meant that our Lord was literally what is called the <i>attribute</i> of reason or wisdom in the Divine Essence, or in other words, that He was God merely viewed as He is wise; which would be a kind of Sabellianism. But, whereas their opponents said that He was but <i>called</i> Word and Wisdom <i>after</i> the attribute (vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 15, note), they said that such titles marked, not only a typical resemblance to the attribute, but so full a correspondence and (as it were) coincidence in <i>nature</i> with it, that whatever relation that attribute had to God, such in kind had the Son;-that the attribute was His symbol, and not His mere archetype; that our Lord was eternal and proper to God, because that attribute was, which was His title, vid. <i>Ep. Aeg.</i> 14, that our Lord was that Essential Reason and Wisdom,-not <i>by</i> which the Father <i>is</i> wise, but <i>without</i> which the Father was <i>not</i> wise;-not, that is, in the way of a formal cause, but in <i>fact.</i> Or, whereas the Father Himself is Reason and Wisdom, the Son is the necessary result of that Reason and Wisdom, so that, to say that there was no Word, would imply there was no Divine Reason; just as a radiance implies a light; or, as Petavius remarks, l.c. quoting the words which follow shortly after in the text, the eternity of the Original implies the eternity of the Image; </font><font face="SPIonic">thj upostasewj uparxoushj, pantwj euquj einai dei ton xarkthra kai thn eikona tauthj</font><font>, §20. vid. also infr. §31, <i>de Decr.</i> §13, p. 21, §§29, 23, pp. 35, 40.

<p><a name="P5436_2132202"></a>
<sup>135 </sup>This was but the opposite aspect of the tenet of our Lord's consubstantiality or eternal generation. For if He came into being at the will of God, by the same will He might cease to be; but if His existence is unconditional and necessary, as God's attributes might be, then as He had no beginning, so can He have no end; for He is in, and one with, the Father, who has neither beginning nor end. On the question of the `will of God' as it affects the doctrine, vid. <i>Orat.</i> iii. §59, &amp;c.</p>

<sup>139 </sup>Athan. argues from the very name Image for our Lord's eternity. An Image, to be really such, must be an expression from the Original, not an external and detached imitation. vid. supr. note 10, infr. §26. Hence S. Basil, `He is an Image not made with the hand, or a work of art, but a living Image,' &amp;c. vid. also <i>contr. Eunom.</i> ii. 16, 17. Epiph <i>Hoer.</i> 76. 3. Hilar. <i>Trin.</i> vii. 41 fin. Origen observes that man, on the contrary, is an example of an external or improper image of God. <i>Periarch.</i> i. 2. §6. It might have been more direct to have argued from the name of Image to our Lord's consubstantiality rather than eternity, as, e.g. S. Gregory Naz. `He is Image as one in essence, <font face="SPIonic">omoousion</font><font>, ...for this is the nature of an image, to be a copy of the archetype.' <i>Orat.</i> 30. 20. vid. also <i>de Decr.</i> §§20, 23, but for whatever reason Athan. avoids the word </font><font face="SPIonic">omoousion</font><font> in these Discourses.

<sup>145 </sup>The objection is this, that, if our Lord be the Father's Image, He ought to resemble Him in being a Father. S. Athanasius answers that God is not as man; with us a son becomes a father because our nature is <font face="SPIonic">reusth</font><font>, transitive and without stay, ever shifting and passing on into new forms and relations; but that God is perfect and ever the same, what He is once that He continues to be; God the Father remains Father, and God the Son remains Son. Moreover men become fathers by detachment and transmission, and what is received is handed on in a succession; whereas the Father, by imparting Himself wholly, begets the Son: and a perfect nativity finds its termination in itself. The Son has not a Son, because the Father has not a Father. Thus the Father is the only true Father, and the Son alone true Son; the Father only a Father, the Son only a Son; being really in their Persons what human fathers are but by office, character, accident, and name; vid. <i>De Decr.</i> 11, note 6. And since the Father is unchangeable as Father, in nothing does the Son more fulfil the idea of a perfect Image than in being unchangeable too. Thus S. Cyril also, <i>Thesaur.</i> 10. p. 124. And this perhaps may illustrate a strong and almost startling implication of some of the Greek Fathers, that the First Person in the Holy Trinity, is not God [<i>in virtue</i> of His Fatherhood]. E.g. </font><font face="SPIonic">ei de qeoj o uioj, ouk epei uioj: omoiwj kai o pathr, ouk epei pathr, qeoj: all' epei ousia toiade, eij esti pathr kai o uioj qeoj</font><font>. <i>Nyssen.</i> t. i. p. 915. vid. Petav. <i>de Deo</i> i. 9. §13. Should it be asked, `What is the Father if not God?' it is enough to answer, `the Father.' Men differ from each other as being individuals, but the characteristic difference between Father and Son is, not that they are individuals, but that they <i>are</i> Father and Son. In these extreme statements it must he ever horne in mind that we are contemplating divine things according to <i>our notions.</i> not in <i>fact:</i> i.e. speaking of the Almighty Father, <i>as such;</i> there being no real separation between His Person and His Substance. It may be added, that, though theologians differ in their decisions, it would appear that our Lord is not the Image of the Father's person, but of the Father's substance; in other words, not of the Father considered as Father, but considered as God That is, God the Son is like and equal to God the Father, because they are both the same God. <i>De Syn.</i> 49. note 4, also next note</font></p>

<sup>148 </sup>This miserable procedure, of making sacred and mysterious subjects a matter of popular talk and debate, which is a sure mark of heresy, had received a great stimulus about this time by the rise of the Anomoeans. Eusebius's testimony to the profaneness which attended Arianism upon its rise will be given <i>de Syn.</i> 2, note 1. The Thalia is another instance of it. S. Alexander speaks of the interference, even judicial, in its behalf against himself, of disobedient women, <font face="SPIonic">di' entuxiaj gunaikariwn ataktwn a hpathsan</font><font>, and of the busy and indecent gadding about of the younger, </font><font face="SPIonic">ek tou peritroxazein pasan aguian asemnwj</font><font>. ap. Theod. <i>H.E.</i> i. 3. p. 730, also p. 747; also of the men's buffoon conversation, p. 731. Socrates says that `in the Imperial Court, the officers of the bedchamber held disputes with the women, and in the city in every house there was a war of dialectics.' <i>Hist.</i> ii. 2. This mania raged especially in Constantinople, and S. Gregory Naz. speaks of `Jezebels in as thick a crop as hemlock in a field.' <i>Orat.</i> 35. 3, cf. <i>de Syn.</i> 13, n. 4. He speaks of the heretics as `aiming at one thing only, how to make good or refute points of argument,' making `every market-place resound with their words, and spoiling every entertainment with their trifling and offensive talk.' <i>Orat.</i> 27. 2. The most remarkable testimony of the kind though not concerning Constantinople, is given by S. Gregory Nyssen, and often quoted, `Men of yesterday and the day before, mere mechanics, off-hand dogmatists in theology, servants too and slaves that have been flogged, runaways from servile work, are solemn with us and philosophical about things incomprehensible. ...With such the whole city is full; its smaller gates, forums, squares, thoroughfares; the clothes-venders, the money-lenders, the victuallers. Ask about pence, and he will discuss the Generate and Ingenerate; inquire the price of bread, he answers, Greater is the Father, and the Son is subject; say that a bath would suit you, mad he defines that the Son is out of nothing.' t. 2. p. 898.</font></p>

<sup>163 </sup>Supr. <i>de Decr.</i> 6. The question was, <i>What</i> was that sense of Son which would apply to the Divine Nature? The Catholics said that its essential meaning <i>could</i> apply, viz. consubstantiality, whereas the point of posteriority to the Father depended on a condition, <i>time,</i> which could not exist in the instance of God. ib. 10. The Arians on the other hand said, that to suppose a true Son, was to think of God irreverently, as implying division, change, &amp;c. The Catholics replied that the notion of materiality was quite as foreign from the Divine Essence as time, and as the Divine Sonship was eternal, so was it also clear both of imperfection or extension.</p>

<sup>164 </sup>It is from expressions such as this that the Greek Fathers have been accused of tritheism. The truth is, every illustration, as being incomplete on one or other side of it, taken by itself, tends to heresy. The title Son by itself suggests a second God, as the title Word a mere attribute, and the title Instrument a creature. All heresies are partial views of the truth, and are wrong, not so much in what they say, as in what they deny. The truth, on the other hand, is a positive and comprehensive doctrine, and in consequence necessarily mysterious and open to misconception. vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 41, note 1. When Athan, implies that the Eternal Father is in the Son, though remaining what He is, as a man in his child, he is intent only upon the point of the Son's connaturality and equality, which the Arians denied. Cf. <i>Orat.</i> iii. §5; Ps.-Ath. <i>Dial</i> i. (Migne xxviii. 1144 C.). S. Cyril even seems to deny that each individual man may be considered a separate substance except as the Three Persons are such (<i>Dial.</i> i. p. 409); and S. Gregory Nyssen is led to say that, strictly speaking, the abstract <i>man</i>, which is predicated of separate individuals, is still one, and this with a view of illustrating the Divine Unity. <i>ad Ablab.</i> t. 2. p. 449. vid. Petav. <i>de Trin.</i> iv. 9.</p>

<sup>166 </sup>S. Athanasius's doctrine is, that, God containing in Himself all perfection, whatever is excellent in one created thing above another, is found in its perfection in Him. If then such generation as radiance from light is more perfect than that of children from parents, that belongs, and transcendently, to the All-perfect God. </p>

<sup>167 </sup>This is a view familiar to the Fathers, viz. that in this consists our Lord's Sonship, that He is the Word, or as S Augustine says, Christum ideo Filium quia Verbum.

<sup>169 </sup>Heretics have frequently assigned reverence as the cause of their opposition to the Church; and if even Arius affected it, the plea may be expected in any other. `O stultos et impios metus,' says S. Hilary, `et irreligiosam de Deo sollicitudinem.' <i>de Trin.</i> iv. 6. It was still more commonly professed in regard to the Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation. Cf. <i>Acta Archelai</i> [Routh. <i>Rell.</i> v. 169]. August. <i>contr. Secund.</i> 9, <i>contr. Faust.</i> xi. 3. As the Manichees denied our Lord a body, so the Apollinarians denied Him a rational soul, still under pretence of reverence because, as they said, the soul was necessarily sinful. Leontius makes this their main argument, <font face="SPIonic">o nouj amarthtikoj esti</font><font>. <i>de Sect.</i> iv. p. 507. vid. also Greg. Naz. <i>Ep.</i> 101. <i>ad Cledon.</i> p. 89; Athan. <i>in Apoll.</i> i. 2. 14. Epiph. <i>Ancor.</i> 79. 80. Athan., &amp;c., call the Apollinarian doctrine Manichaan in consequence. vid. in <i>Apoll.</i> ii. 8. 9. &amp;c. Again, the Eranistes in Theodoret, who advocates a similar doctrine, will not call our Lord <i>man.</i> <i>Eranist.</i> ii. p. 83. Eutyches, on the other hand, would call our Lord <i>man,</i> but refused to admit His human <i>nature,</i> and still with the same profession. Leon. <i>Ep.</i> 21. 1 fin. `Forbid it,' he says at Constantinople, `that I should say that the Christ was of two natures, or should discuss the nature, </font><font face="SPIonic">fusiologein</font><font>, of my God.' <i>Concil.</i> t. 2. p. 157 [Act. <i>prima conc.

<sup>172 </sup>Athan.'s argument is as follows: that, as it is of the essence of a son to be `connatural' with the father, so is it of the essence of a creature to be of `nothing,' <font face="SPIonic">ec ouk ontwn</font><font>; therefore, while it was <i>not</i> impossible `from the nature of the case,' for Almighty God to be always Father, it <i>was</i> impossible for the same reason that He should be always a Creator. vid. infr. §58: where he takes, `They shall perish,' in the Psalm, not as a fact but as the definition of the <i>nature</i> of a creature. Also ii. §1, where he says, `It is proper to creatures and works to have said of them, </font><font face="SPIonic">ec ouk ontwn</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">ouk hn prin gennhqh</font><font>.' vid.

<sup>173 </sup>The word <font face="SPIonic">aggen</font><font>[</font><font face="SPIonic">n</font><font>]</font><font face="SPIonic">hton</font><font> was in the philosophical schools synonymous with `God;' hence by asking whether there were two Unoriginates, the Arians implied that there were two Gods, if Christ was God in the sense in which the Father was. Hence Athan. retorts, </font><font face="SPIonic">faskontej, ou legomen duo agenhta, legousi duo qeouj</font><font>. <i>Orat.</i> iii. 16, also ii. 38. Plato used </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhton</font><font> of the Supreme God [not so; he used </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhton</font><font>, see note 2 on <i>de Decr.</i> 28]; the Valentinians, Tertull. <i>contr. Val.</i> 7; and Basilides, Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 31. 10. S. Clement uses it, see <i>de Syn.</i> 47, note 7. [The earlier Arians apparently argued mainly, like Asterius, from </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font> (cr. Epiph. 64. 8), the later (</font><font face="SPIonic">kainoi</font><font>, Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 73. 19) Anomoeans rather from </font><font face="SPIonic">agennhtoj</font><font>]; viz. that </font><font face="SPIonic">h agennhsia</font><font> is the very </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> of God, not an attribute. So Aetius in Epiph. <i>Hoer.</i> 76. S. Athanasius does not go into this question, but rather confines himself to the more popular form of it, viz. the Son is by His very name not </font><font face="SPIonic">agenhtoj</font><font>, but </font><font face="SPIonic">genhtoj</font><font>, but all </font><font face="SPIonic">genhta</font><font> are creatures; which he answers, as <i>de Decr.</i> §28, by saying that Christianity had brought in a new idea into theology, viz. the sacred doctrine of a true Son, </font><font face="SPIonic">ek thj ousiaj</font><font>. This was what the Arians had originally denied </font><font face="SPIonic">en to agennhton en de to up' autou alhqwj, kai ouk ek thj ousiaj autou gegonoj</font><font>. Euseb. Nic. ap. Theod. <i>H.E.</i> i. 6. When they were urged <i>what</i> according to them was the middle idea to which the Son answered, if they would not accept the Catholic, they would not define but merely said, </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhma, all' ouk wj en twn gennhuatwn</font><font>. [See pp. 149, 169, and the reference there to Lightfoot.]</font></p>

<sup>177 </sup>The two first senses here given answer to the two first mentioned, <i>de Decr.</i> §28. and, as he there says, are plainly irrelevant. The third in the <i>de Decr.</i> which, as he there observes, is ambiguous and used for a sophistical purpose, is here divided into third and fourth, answering to the two senses which alone are assigned in the <i>de Syn.</i> §46 [where see note 5], and on them the question turns. This is an instance, of which many occur, how Athan. used his former writings and worked over again his former ground, and simplified or cleared what he had said. In the <i>de Decr.</i> after 350, we have three senses of <font face="SPIonic">agenhton</font><font>, two irrelevant and the third ambiguous; here in <i>Orat.</i> i. (358), he divides the third into two; in the <i>de Syn.</i> (359), he rejects and omits the two first, leaving the two last, which are the critical senses. </font></p>
