<sup>53 </sup>Cf. <i>Orat.</i> i. §§2-5; <i>de Sent. D.</i> 6; Socr. i. 9. The Arian Philostorgius tells us that `Arius wrote songs for the sea and for the mill and for the road, and then set them to suitable music,' <i>Hist.</i> ii. 2. It is remarkable that Athanasius should say the <i>Egyptian</i> Sotades, and again in <i>Sent. D.</i> 6. There were two Poets of the name; one a writer of the Middle Comedy, <i>Athen. Deipn.</i> vii. 11; but the other, who is here spoken of, was a native of Maronea in Crete, according to Suidas (<i>in voc.</i>), under the successors of Alexander, <i>Athen.</i> xiv. 4. He wrote in Ionic metre, which was of infamous name from the subjects to which he and others applied it. vid. <i>Suid.</i> ibid. Horace's Ode. `Miserarum est neque amori, &amp;c.' is a specimen of this metre, and some have called it Sotadic; but Bentley shews <i>in loc.</i> that Sotades wrote in the Ionic a majore. Athenaeus implies that all Ionic metres were called Sotadic, or that Sotades wrote in various Ionic metres. The Church adopted the Doric music, and forbade the Ionic and Lydian. The name `Thalia' commonly belonged to convivial songs; Martial contrasts the `lasciva Thalia' with `carmina sanctiora,' <i>Epigr.</i> vii. 17. vid. Thaliarchus, `the master of the feast,' Horat. Od. i. 9. [The metre of the fragments of the `Thalia' is obscure, there are no traces of the Ionic foot, but very distinct anapaestic cadences. In fact the lines resemble ill-constructed or very corrupt anapaestic tetrameters catalectic, as in a comic <i>Parabasis.</i> For Sotades, the Greek text here reads corruptly Sosates.]</p>

<sup>65 </sup>Bull considers that the doctrine of such Fathers is here spoken of as held that our Lord's <font face="SPIonic">sugkatabasij</font><font> to create the world was a </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhsij</font><font>, and certainly such language as that of Hippol. <i>contr. Noet.</i> §15. favours the supposition. But one class of [Monarchians] may more probably be intended, who held that the Word became the Son upon His incarnation, such as Marcellus, vid. Euseb. <i>Eccles. Theol.</i> i. 1. <i>contr. Marc.</i> ii. 3. vid. also <i>Eccles. Theol.</i> ii. 9 p. 114 b. </font><font face="SPIonic">mhd allote allhn k.t.l</font><font>. Also the Macrostich says, `We anathematize those who call Him the mere Word of God, not allowing Him to be Christ and Son of God before all ages, but from the time He took on Him our flesh: such are the followers of Marcellus and Photinus, &amp;c.' <i>infr.</i> §26. Again, Athanasius, <i>Orat.</i> iv. 15, says that, of those who divide the Word from the Son, some called our Lord's manhood the Son, some the two Natures together, and some said `that the Word Himself became the Son when He was made man.' It makes it more likely that Marcellus is meant, that Asterius seems to have written against him before the Nicene Council, and that Arius in other of his writings borrowed from Asterius. vid. <i>de Decret.</i> §8.</font></p>
<p><a name="P7424_2956316"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>Eusebius's letter to Euphration, which is mentioned just after, expresses this more distinctly-`If they coexist, how shall the Father be Father and the Son Son? or how the One first, the Other second? and the One ingenerate and the other generate?' <i>Acta Conc.</i> 7. p. 301. The phrase <font face="SPIonic">ta proj ti</font><font> Bull well explains to refer to the Catholic truth that the Father or Son being named; the Other is therein implied without naming. <i>Defens. F. N.</i> iii. 9. §4. Hence Arius, in his Letter to Eusebius, complains that Alexander says, </font><font face="SPIonic">aei o qeoj, aei o uioj ama pathr, ama uioj</font><font>. Theod. <i>H.

<sup>68 </sup>Most of these original Arians were attacked in a work of Marcellus's which Eusebius answers. `Now he replies to Asterius,' says Eusebius, `now to the great Eusebius' [of Nicomedia], `and then he turns upon that man of God, that indeed thrice blessed person Paulinus [of Tyre]. Then he goes to war with Origen. ...Next he marches out against Narcissus, and pursues the other Eusebius,' [himself]. `In a word, he counts for nothing all the Ecclesiastical Fathers, being satisfied with no one but himself.' <i>contr. Marc.</i> i. 4. [On Marls (who was <i>not</i> at Ariminum, and scarcely at Antioch in 363) see D.C.B. <i>s.v.</i> (2). On Theodotus see vol. i. of this series, p. 320, note 37.

<sup>71 </sup>Asterius has been mentioned above, p. 155, note 2, &amp;c. Philostorgius speaks of him as adopting Semi-Arian terms; and Acacius H gives an extract from him containing them, ap. Epiph. <i>Haer. 72. 6. He seems to be called many-headed with an allusion to the Hydra, and to his activity in the Arian cause and his fertility in writing. He wrote comments on Scripture.

<sup>80 </sup>2nd Confession or end of Antioch, a.d. 341. This formulary is that known as <i>the</i> Formulary of the Dedication. It is quoted as such by Socr. ii. 39, 40. Soz. iv. 15. and <i>infr.</i> §29. [On its attribution to Lucian, see Prolegg. <i>ubi supr.,</i> and Caspari <i>Alte. u. Neue</i> Q. p. 42 note.]</p>

<p><a name="P7460_2973265"></a>
<sup>82 </sup>These strong words and those which follow, whether Lucian's or not, mark the great difference between this confession and the foregoing. The words `unalterable and unchangeable' are formal anti-Arian symbols, as the <font face="SPIonic">trepton</font><font> alterable was one of the most characteristic parts of Arius's creed. vid. <i>Orat.</i> i. §35, &amp;c.</font></p>
<p><a name="P7461_2973612"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>On <font face="SPIonic">aparallaktoj eikwn kat ousian</font><font>, which was synonymous with </font><font face="SPIonic">omoiusioj</font><font>, vid. <i>infr.</i> §38. <i>supr.</i> p. 163, note 9. It was in order to secure the true sense of </font><font face="SPIonic">aparallakton</font><font> that the Council adopted the word </font><font face="SPIonic">omoousion. 'Aparallakton</font><font> is accordingly used as a familiar word by Athan. <i>de Decr.</i> §20, 24. <i>Orat.</i> iii. §36. <i>contr. Gent.</i> 41. 46. fin. Philostorgius ascribing it to Asterius, and Acacius quotes a passage from his writings containing it; cf. S.

Basil. <i>contr. Eunom.</i> i. 18.</font></p>
<p><a name="P7462_2974619"></a>
<sup>84 </sup>This statement perhaps is the most Catholic in the Creed; not that the former axe not more explicit in themselves, or that in a certain true sense our Lord may not be called a Mediator before He became incarnate, but because the Arians, even Eusebius, like Philo and the Platonists, consider Him as made in the beginning the `Eternal Priest of the Father,' <i>Demonst.</i> v. 3. <i>de Land. C.</i> 3, 11, `an intermediate divine power,' §26, 27, and notes.</p>
<p><a name="P7464_2976043"></a>
<sup>85 </sup>On this phrase, which is justified by S. Hilary, <i>de Syn.</i> 32, and is protested against in the Sardican Confession, Theod. H.E. ii. 6 [see Prolegg. <i>ubi supr.</i>]</p>
<p><a name="P7466_2976347"></a>
<sup>86 </sup>The whole of these anathemas are [a compromise]. The Council anathematizes `<i>every</i> heretical heterodoxy;' not, as Athanasius observes, <i>supr.,</i> §7, the Arian.</p>

<sup>87 </sup>Our Lord was, as they held, <i>before</i> time, but still created.</p>

<sup>88 </sup>This emphatic mention of Scripture is also virtually an Arian evasion, admitting of a silent reference to themselves as interpreters of Scripture.</p>

<sup>90 </sup>3rd Confession or 3rd of Antioch, a.d. 341.</p>
<p><a name="P7474_2977971"></a>
<sup>91 </sup>It need Scarcely be said, that `perfect from perfect' is symbol on which the Catholics laid stress. Athan. <i>Orat.</i> ii. 35. Epiph. <i>Haer.</i> 76. p. 945. but it admitted of an evasion. An especial reason for insisting on it in the previous centuries had been the Sabellian doctrine, which considered the title `Word' when applied to our Lord to be adequately explained by the ordinary sense of the term, as a word spoken by us. In consequence they insisted on His <font face="SPIonic">to teleion</font><font>, perfection, which became almost synonymous with His personality. (Thus the Apollinarians, e.g. denied that our Lord was <i>perfect</i> man, because His <i>person</i> was not human. Athan. <i>contr. Apoll.</i> i. 2.) And Athan. condemns the notion of 'the </font><font face="SPIonic">logoj en tw qew atelhj, gennhqeij teleioj</font><font>, Orat. iv. 11. The Arians then, as being the especial opponents of the Sabellians, insisted on nothing so much as our Lord's being a real, living, substantial, Word. vid. Eusebius <i>passim.</i> `The Father,' says Acacius against Marcellus, `begat the Only-begotten, alone alone, and perfect perfect; for there is nothing imperfect in the Father, wherefore neither is there in the Son, but the Son's perfection is the genuine offspring of His perfection, and superperfection.' <i>ap. Epiph. Haer.</i> 72. 7. </font><font face="SPIonic">Teleioj</font><font> then was a relative word, varying with the subject matter, vid. <i>Damasc. F. O.</i> i. 8. p. 138. and when the Arians said that our Lord was perfect God, they meant, `perfect, <i>in that sense in which</i> He is God '-i.e. as a secondary divinity.-Nay, in one point of view, holding as they did no real condescension or assumption of a really new state, they would use the term of His divine Nature more freely than the Catholics sometimes had. `Nor was the Word,' says Hippolytus, `before the flesh and by Himself, perfect Son, though being perfect Word, Only-begotten; nor could the flesh subsist by itself without the Word, because that in the Word it has its consistence: thus then He was manifested One perfect Son of God.' <i>contr. Noet.</i> 15.</font></p>

<sup>92 </sup>[See Prolegg.] Marcellus wrote his work against Asterius in 335, the year of the Arian Council of Jerusalem, which at once took cognisance of it, and cited Marcellus to appear before them. The next year a Council held at Constantinople condemned and deposed him.</p>

<sup>95 </sup>4th Confession, or 4th of Antioch, a.d. 342. The fourth, fifth, and sixth Confessions are the same, and with them agree the Creed of Philippopolis [a.d. 343, see Gwatkin, <i>Stud.</i> p. 119, espec. note 2].</p>
<p><a name="P7484_2982784"></a>
<sup>96 </sup>These words, which answer to those [of our present `Nicene' Creed], are directed against the doctrine of Marcellus [on which see Prolegg. ii. §3 (2) c, 3]. Cf. Eusebius, <i>de Eccl. Theol.</i> iii. 8. 17. <i>cont. Marc.</i> ii. 4.</p>
<p><a name="P7487_2983546"></a>
<sup>97 </sup>S. Hilary, as we have seen above, p. 78, by implication calls this the Nicene Anathema; but it omits many of the Nicene clauses, and evades our Lord's eternal existence, substituting for `once He was not,' `there was <i>time</i> when He was not.' It seems to have been considered sufficient for Gaul, as used now, for Italy as in the 5th Confession or Macrostich, and for Africa as in the creed of Philippopolis.</p>
<p><a name="P7489_2984101"></a>
<sup>98 </sup>Little is known of Macedonius who was Bishop of Mopsuestia, or of Martyrius; and too much of Eudoxius. This Long Confession, or Macrostich, which follows, is remarkable; [see <i>Prolegg,</i> ch. ii. §6 (3), Gwatkin, p. 125 <i>sq.</i>]</p>

<sup>100 </sup>It is observable that here and in the next paragraph the only reasons they give against using the only two Arian formulas which they condemns is that they are not found in Scripture.

<p><a name="P7498_2987556"></a>
<sup>101 </sup>They argue after the usual Arian manner, that the term `Son' essentially implies beginning, and excludes the title `co-unoriginate;' but see <i>supr.</i> §16, note 1, and p. 154, note 5.</p>
