At first he but uses the same topics, but presently he incorporates into this Discourse an actual portion of his former work, with only stroh alterations as an author commonly makes in transcribing. This, which is not unfrequent with Athan., shews us the care with which he made his doctrinal statements, though they seem at first sight written off. It also accounts for the diffuseness and repetition which might be imputed to his composition, what seems superfluous being often only the insertion of an extract from a former work.</p>

<sup>210 </sup>The Arians perhaps more than other heretics were remarkable for bringing objections against the received view, rather than forming a consistent theory of their own Indeed the very vigour and success of their assault upon the truth lay in its being a mere assault, not a positive and substantive teaching. They therefore, even more than others, might fairly be urged on to the consequences of their positions. Now the text in question, as it must be interpreted if it is to serve as an objection, was an objection also to the received doctrine of the Arians. They considered that our Lord was above and before all creatures from the first, and their Creator; how then could He be exalted above all? They surely, as much as Catholics, were obliged to explain it of our Lord's manhood. They could not then use it as a weapon against the Church, until they took the ground of Paul of Samosata.</p>

<sup>218 </sup>In this passage Athan. considers that the participation ofthe Word is deification, as communion with the Son is adoption: also that the old Saints, inasmuch as they are called `gods' and `sons,' did partake of the Divine Word and Son, or in other words were gifted with the Spirit. He asserts the same doctrine very strongly in <i>Orat.</i> iv. §22. On the other hand, infr. 47, he says expressly that Christ received the Spirit in Baptism `that He might give it to man.' There is no real contradiction in such statements; what was given in one way under the Law, was given in another and fuller under the Gospel.</p>

<sup>230 </sup>Scripture is full of misteries, but they are mysteries of <i>fact,</i> not of words. Its dark sayings or aenigmata are such, because in the nature of things they cannot be expressed clearly. Hence contrariwise. <i>Orat</i> ii. §77 fin. he calls Prov. viii. 22. an enigma, with an allusion to Prov. i. 6. Sept. In like manner S. Ambrose. says, Mare est scriptura divina, habens in se sensus profundos, et altitudinem propheticorum <i>oenigmatum,</i> &amp;c. <i>Ep</i>. ii. 3. What is commonly called `explaining away' Scripture, is this transference of the obscurity from the subject to the words used.</p>

<sup>234 </sup>When Scripture says that our Lord was exalted, it means in that sense in which He could be exalted; just as, in saying that a man walks or eats, we speak of him not as a spirit, but as in that system of things to which the ideas of walking and eating belong. Exaltation is not a word which can belong to God; it is unmeaning, and <i>therefore</i> is <i>not</i> applied to Him in the text in question. Thus, e.g. S. Ambrose: `Ubi humilatus, ibi obediens. Ex eo enim nascitur obedientia, ex quo humilitas <i>et in eo desinit,</i>' &amp;c. <i>Ap. Dav. alt.</i> n. 39.</p>

<sup>244 </sup>It was usual to say against the Apollinarians, that, unless our Lord took on Him our nature; <i>as it is,</i> He had not purified and changed it, as it is, but another nature; `The Lord came not to save Adam as free from sin, that He should become like unto him; but as, in the net of sin and now fallen, that God's mercy might raise him up with Christ.' Leont. <i>contr. Nestor.</i> &amp;c. ii. p. 996. Accordingly, Athan. says elsewhere, `Had not sinlessness appeared [cf. Rom. viii. 3, <font face="SPIonic">pemyaj</font><font>] "in the nature which had sinned," how was sin condemned in the flesh?' in <i>Apoll.</i> ii. 6. `It was necessary for our salvation,' says S. Cyril, `that the Word of God should become man, that human flesh "subject to corruption" and "sick with the lust of pleasures," He might make His own; and. "whereas He is life and lifegiving," He might "destroy the corruption," &amp;c. ...For by this means, might sin in our flesh become dead.' Ep. ad <i>Success.</i> i. p. 138. And S. Leo, `Non alterius naturae erat ejus caro quam nostra, nec alio illi quam caeteris hominibus anima est inspirata principio, quae excelleret, non diversitate generis, sed sublimitate virtutis.' <i>Ep.</i> 35 fin. vid. also <i>Ep.</i> 28. 3. <i>Ep.</i> 31. 2. <i>Ep.</i> 165. 9. <i>Serm.</i> 22. 2. and 25. 5. It may be asked whether this doctrine does not interfere with that of the immaculate conception [i.e. that <i>Christ</i> was conceived sinless]; but that miracle was wrought in order that our Lord might not be born in original sin, and does not affect, or rather includes, His taking flesh of the substance of the Virgin, i.e. of a fallen nature. If indeed sin were `of the substance' of our fallen nature, as some heretics have said, then He could not have taken our nature without partaking our sinfulness; but if sin be, as it is, a fault of the <i>will,</i> then the Divine Power of the Word could sanctfy the human will, and keep it from swerving in the direction of evil. Hence `We say not that Christ by the felicity of a flesh separated from sense <i>could not</i> feel the desire of sin, but that by perfection of virtue, and by a flesh not begotten through concupiscence of the flesh, He <i>had not</i> the desire of sin;' Aug. <i>Op. Imperf.</i> iv. 48. On the other hand, S. Athanasius expressly calls it Manichean doctrine to consider </font><font face="SPIonic">thn fusin</font><font> of the flesh </font><font face="SPIonic">amartian, kai ou thn pracin</font><font>. <i>contr. Apoll.</i> i. 12 fin. or </font><font face="SPIonic">fusikhn einai thn amartian</font><font>. ibid. i. 14 fin. His argument in the next ch. is on the ground that all <i>natures</i> are from God, but God made man upright nor is the author of evil (vid. also Vit. Anton. 20); `not as if,' he says, `the devil wrought in man a nature (God forbid!) for of a nature the evil cannot be maker (</font><font face="SPIonic">dhmiourgoj</font><font>) as is the impiety of the Manichees, but he wrought a bias of nature by transgression, and `so death reigned over all men.' Wherefore, saith he, `the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil;' what works? that nature, which God made sinless, and the devil biassed to the transgression of God's command and the finding out of sin which is death, did God the Word raise again, so as to be secure from the devil's bias and the finding out of sin. And therefore the Lord said, "The prince of this world cometh and findeth nothing in Me."' vid. also §19. Ibid. ii. 6. he speaks of the devil having `introduced the <i>law</i> of sin.' vid. also §9.</font></p>

<sup>253 </sup>It was a point in controversy with the extreme Monophysites, that is, the Eutychians, whether our Lord's body was naturally subject to death, the Catholics maintaining the affirmative, as Athanasius here. Eutyches asserted that our Lord had not a human nature, by which he meant among other things that His manhood was not subject to the <i>laws</i> of a body, but so far as He submitted to them, He did so by an act of will in each particular case; and this, lest it should seem that He was moved by the <font face="SPIonic">paqh</font><font> against His will </font><font face="SPIonic">akousiwj</font><font>; and consequently that His manhood was not subject to death. But the Catholics maintained that He had voluntarily placed Himself <i>under</i> those laws, and died <i>naturally,</i> vid. Athan. <i>contr. Apol.</i> i. 17, and that after the resurrection His body became incorruptible, not according to nature, but by grace. vid. Leont. <i>de Sect.</i> x. p. 530. Anast. <i>Hodeg.</i> c. 23. To express their doctrine of the </font><font face="SPIonic">uperfuej</font><font> of our Lord's manhood the Eutychians made use of the Catholic expression `ut voluit.' vid. Athan. l.c.

<sup>256 </sup>At first sight it would seem as if S. Athanasius here used <font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> <i>essence</i> for subsistence, or person; but this is not true except with an explanation. Its <i>direct</i> meaning is here, as usual, essence, though <i>indirectly</i> it comes to imply subsistence. He is speaking of that Divine Essence which, though also the Almighty Father's, is as simply and entirely the Word's as if it were only His. Nay, even when the Essence of the Father is spoken of in a sort of contrast to that of the Son, as in the phrase </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia ec ousiaj</font><font>, harsh as such expressions are, it is not accurate to say that </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> is used for subsistence or person, or that two </font><font face="SPIonic">ousiai</font><font> are spoken of (vid. <i>de Syn.</i> 52, note 8), except, that is, by Arians, as Eusebius, supr. <i>Ep.

<sup>257 </sup>This was the question which came into discussion in the Nestorian controversy, when, as it was then expressed, all that took place in respect to the Eternal Word as man, belonged to His <i>Person,</i> and therefore might be predicated of Him; so that it was heretical not to confess the Word's body (or the body of God in the Person of the Word), the Word's death (as Athan, in the text), the Word's exaltation, and the Word's, or God's, Mother, who was in consequence called <font face="SPIonic">qeotokoj</font><font>, which was the expression on which the controversy mainly turned. Cf. <i>Orat.</i> iii. 31, a passage as precise as if it had been written after the Nestorian and Eutychian controversies, though without the technical words then adopted. </font></p>
