<sup>17 </sup>Dalmatius was the name of father and son, the brother and nephew of Constantine. Socrates, <i>Hist.</i> i. 27. gives the title of Censor to the son; but the <i>Chron. Pasch.</i> p. 531 (Dind.) gives it to the father. Valesius, and apparently Tillemont (<i>Empereurs,</i> vol. 4. p. 657) think Socrates mistaken. The younger Dalmatias was created Caesar by Constantine a few year before his death; and as well as his brother Hannibalian, and a number of other relatives, was put to death by the soldiery, on the death of Constantine. vid. <i>Hist. Ar.</i> 69. [Gwatkin, p. 108 note].</p>

<sup>21 </sup>According to the system of government introduced by Diocletian and Constantine, there were thirty-five military commanders of the troops, under the Magistri militum, and all of these bore the name of duces or dukes; the comites, or counts, were ten out of the number, who were distinguished as companions of the Emperor. vid. Gibbon, ch. 17. Three of these dukes were stationed in Egypt [i.e. in the whole prefecture; one only in the province of Egypt in the narrower sense].</p>

<sup>26 </sup>On the "cursus publicus," vid. Gothofred. <i>in Cod. Theod.</i> viii. tit. 5. It was provided for the journeys of the Emperor, for persons whom he summoned, for magistrates, ambassadors, and for such private persons as the Emperor indulged in the use of it, which was gratis. The use was granted by Constantine to the Bishops who were summoned to Nicaea, as far as it went, in addition (though aliter Valesius in loc.) to other means of travelling. Euseb. <i>v. Const.</i> iii. 6. The cursus publicus brought the Bishops to the Council of Tyre. <i>ibid.</i> iv. 43. In the conference between Liberius and Constantius, Theod. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 13. it is objected that the cursus publicus is not sufficient to convey Bishops to the Council which Liberius proposes; he answers that the Churches are rich enough to convey their Bishops as far as the sea. Thus S. Hilary was compelled (data evectionis copia, Sulp. Sev. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 57.) to attend at Seleucia, as Athan. at Tyre. Julian complains of the abuse of the cursus publicus, perhaps with an allusion to these Councils of Constantius. vid. <i>Cod. Theod.</i> viii. tit. 5. 1. 12. where Gothofred quotes Liban. <i>Epitaph. in Julian.</i> vol. i. p. 569. ed. Reiske.) Vid. the well-known passage of Ammianus, who speaks of the Councils being the ruin of the res vehicularia <i>Hist.</i> xxi. 16. The Eusebians at Philippopolis say the same thing. Hilar. <i>Frag.</i> iii. 25. The Emperor provided board and perhaps lodging for the Bishops at Ariminum; which the Bishops of Aquitaine, Gaul, and Britain, declined, except three British from poverty. Sulp. <i>Hist.</i> ii. 56. Hunneric in Africa, after assembling 466 Bishops at Carthage, dismissed them without modes of conveyance, provision, or baggage. Victor Utic. <i>Hist.</i> iii. init. In the Emperor's letter previous to the assembling of the sixth Ecumenical Council, a.d. 678, (Harduin, <i>Conc.</i> t. 3. p. 1048 fin.) he says he has given orders for the conveyance and maintenance of its members. Pope John VIII. reminds Ursus, Duke of Venice (a.d. 876.), of the same duty of providing for the members of a Council, "secundum pios principes, qui in talibus munifice semper erant intenti." Colet. <i>Concil.</i> (Ven. 1730,) t. xi. p. 14.</p>

<sup>40 </sup>Curiosus; the Curiosi (in curis agendis) were properly the overseers of the public roads, Du Cange in voc., but they became in consequence a sort of imperial spy and were called the Emperor's eyes.

Here, as in Euseb. <i>Hist.</i> vii. 30. the word stands for a Procurator, whose annual pay amounted, to 200 sestertia, vid. Salmas. <i>Hist Aug.</i> t. l. p. 533.

<sup>47 </sup>The title Patrician was revived by Constantine as a personal distinction. It was for life, and gave precedence over all the great officers of state except the Consul. It was usually bestowed on favourites, or on ministers as a reward of services. Gibbon, <i>Hist,</i> ch. 17. This Julius Constantius, who was the father of Julian, was the first who bore the title, with L. Optatus, who had been consul the foregoing year. Illustrissimus was the highest of the three ranks of honour. <i>ibid.</i></p>
