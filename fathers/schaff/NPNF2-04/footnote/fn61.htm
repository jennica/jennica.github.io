<sup>248 </sup>Of course this line of thought consistently followed, leads to a kind of Pantheism; for what is the Supreme Being, according to it, but an ideal standard of perfection, the sum total of all that we see excellent in the world in the highest degree, a creation of our minds, without real objective existence? The true view of our Lord's titles, on the other hand, is that He is That properly and in perfection, of which in measure and degree the creatures partake from and in Him.

<sup>249 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kat' epinoian</font><font>, in idea or notion. This is a phrase of very frequent occurrence, both in Athan. and other writers. We have found it already just above, and <i>de Syn.</i> 15. <i>Or.</i> i. 9, also <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2, 3. <i>de Sent. D.</i> 2, <i>Ep. Aeg</i> 12, 13, 14. It denotes our idea or conception of a thing in contrast to the thing itself. Thus, the sun is to a savage a bright circle in the sky; a man is a `rational animal,' according to a certain process of abstraction; a herb may be medicine upon one division, food in another; virtue may be called a mean; and faith is to one man an argumentative conclusion, to another a moral peculiarity, good or bad. In like manner, the Almighty is in reality most simple and uncompounded. without parts, passions, attributes, or properties; yet we speak of Him as good or holy, or as angry or pleased, denoting some particular aspect in which our infirmity views, in which also it can view, what is infinite and incomprehensible. That is, He is </font><font face="SPIonic">kat' epinoian</font><font> holy or merciful, being in reality a Unity which is all mercifulness and also all holiness, not in the way of qualities but as one indivisible perfection; which is too great for us to conceive as It is.</font></p>

<sup>251 </sup>The Anomoean in Max. <i>Dial.</i> i. a. urges against the Catholic that, if the Son exists in the Father, God is compound. Athan. here retorts that Asterius speaks of Wisdom as a really existing thing in the Divine Mind. Vid. next note.</p>

<sup>252 </sup>On this subject rid. <i>Orat.</i> iv. n. 2. Nothing is more remarkable than the confident tone in which Athan. accuses Arians as here, and [Marcellus] in <i>Orat.</i> iv. 2. of considering the Divine Nature as compound, as if the Catholics were in no respect open to such a charge. Nor are they; though in avoiding it, they are led to enunciate the most profound and ineffable mystery. Vid. <i>supr.</i> §33, n. 1. The Father is the One Simple Entire Divine Being, and so is the Son; They do in no sense share divinity between Them; Each is is <font face="SPIonic">oloj Qeoj</font><font>. This is not ditheism or tritheism, for they are the same God; nor is it Sabellianism, for They are eternally distinct and substantive Persons; but it is a depth and height beyond our intellect, how what is Two in so full a sense can also in so full a sense be One, or how the Divine Nature does not come under number. vid. notes on <i>Orat.</i> iii. 27 and 36. Thus, `being uncompounded in nature,' says Athan. `He is Father of One Only Son.' <i>de Decr.</i> 11. In truth the distinction into Persons, as Petavius remarks, `avails especially towards the unity and simplicity of God.' vid. <i>de Deo,</i> ii. 4, 8.</font></p>

<sup>265 </sup>He says that it is contrary to all our notions of religion that Almighty God cannot create, enlighten, address, and unite Himself to His creatures immediately. This seems to be implied in saying that the Son was created for creation, illumination, &amp;c.; whereas in the Catholic view the Son is but that Divine Person who in the Economy of grace is creator, enlightener, &amp;c.

<sup>297 </sup>He seems here to say that it is both true that `The Lord created,' and yet that the Son was not created. Creatures alone are created, and He was not a creature. Rather something belonging or relating to Him, something short of His substance or nature, was created. However, it is a question in controversy whether even His Manhood can be called a creature, though many of the Fathers (including Athan. in several places) seem so to call it. On the whole it would appear, (1.) that if `creature,' like `Son,' be a <i>personal</i> term, He is not a creature; but if it be a word of <i>nature,</i> He is a creature; (2.) that our Lord is a creature in respect to the flesh (vid. <i>infr.</i> 47); (3.) that since the flesh is infinitely beneath His divinity, it is neither natural nor safe to call-Him a creature (cf. Thom. A. <i>Sum. Th.</i> iii. xvi. 8, `non dicimus, quod Aethiops est albus, sed quod est albus secundum dentes') and (4.) that, if the flesh is worshipped, still it is worshipped as in the Person of the Son, not by a separate act of worship. Cf. <i>infr. Letter 60. ad Adelph.</i> 3. Epiph. has imitated this passage, <i>Ancor.</i> 51. introducing the illustration of a king and his robe, &amp;c. </p>

Without meaning that the respective terms are synonymous, is it not plain that in a later phraseology this would have been, `not simply that He is in His Person a creature,' or `that His Person is created?' Athan.'s use of the phrase </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia tou logou</font><font> has already been noticed, <i>supr.</i> i. 45, and passages from this Oration are given in another connexion, <i>supr.</i> p. 70, note 15. The term is synonymous with the Divine Nature as existing in the Person of the Word. [Cf. Prolegg. ch. ii. §3 (2) b.] In the passage in the text the </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> of the Word is contrasted to the </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> of creatures; and it is observable that it is implied that our Lord has not taken on Him a created </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font>. 'He said not, Athan. remarks, `I became a creature, for the creatures have a created essence;' he adds that `He created' signifies, <i>not</i> essence, but something taking place in Him </font><font face="SPIonic">peri ekeinon</font><font>, i.e. some adjunct or accident (e.g. notes on <i>de Decr.</i> 22), or as he says <i>supr.</i> §8, envelopment or dress. And <i>infr.</i> §51, he contrasts the </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> and the </font><font face="SPIonic">anqrwpinon</font><font> of the Word; as in <i>Orat.</i> i. 41. </font><font face="SPIonic">ousia</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">h anqrwpothj</font><font>; and </font><font face="SPIonic">fusij</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">sarc</font><font>, iii. 34. init. and </font><font face="SPIonic">logoj</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">sarc</font><font>, 38. init.

It is observed, §8, note, how this line of teaching might be wrested to the purposes of the Apollinarian and Eutychian heresies; and, considering Athan.'s most emphatic protests against their errors in his later works, as well as his strong statements in <i>Orat.</i> iii. there is ho hazard in this admission. His ordinary use of </font><font face="SPIonic">anqrwpoj</font><font> for the manhood might quite as plausibly be perverted on the other hand into a defence of Nestorianism. Vid. also the Ed. Ben. on S.

<sup>315 </sup>Here he says that, though our Lord's flesh is created or He is created as to the flesh, it is not right to call Him a creature. This is very much what S. Thomas says, as referred to in §45, note 1, in the words of the Schools, that Aethiops, albus secundum dentes, non est albns. But why may not our Lord be so called upon the principle of the <i>communicatio Idiomatum</i> (<i>infr.</i> note on iii. 31.) as He is said to be born of a Virgin, to have suffered, &amp;c.? The reason is this:-birth, passion, &amp;c., confessedly belong to His human nature, without adding `according to the flesh;' but `creature' not implying humanity. might appear a simple attribute of His Person, if used without limitation. Thus, as S. Thomas adds, though we may not absolutely say Aethiops est albus, we may say `crispus est,' or in like manner, `calvus est.' Since crispus, or calvus, can but refer to the hair. Still more does this remark apply in the case of `Sonship,' which is a personal attribute altogether; as is proved, says Petav. <i>de Incarn.</i> vii. 6 fin. by the instance of Adam, who was in all respects a man like Seth, yet not a son. Accordingly, we may not call our Lord, even according to the manhood, an adopted Son.</p>

<sup>323 </sup>He says that, though none could be `a beginning' of creation, who was a creature, yet still that such a title belongs not to His essence. It is the name of an <i>office</i> which the Eternal Word alone can fill. His Divine Sonship is both superior and necessary to that office of a `Beginning.' Hence it is both true (as he says) that `if the Word is a creature, He is not a beginning;' and yet that that `beginning' is `in the number of the creatures.' Though He becomes the `beginning,' He is not `a beginning as to His essence,' vid. <i>supr.</i> i. 49, and <i>infr.</i> §60. where he says, `He who is before all, cannot be a beginning of all, but is other than all,' which implies that the beginning of all is not other than all. vid. §8, note 4, on the Priesthood, and §16, n. 7.</p>
