<sup>4 </sup><font face="SPIonic">treij upostaseij</font><font>. This expression is a link between this tract and the <i>Expositio</i> (§2), and is one of the indications it bears of an early date. At this time we see that Athanasius speaks of Three `Hypostases,' but qualifies his language by the caveat (<i>Expos.</i> 2) that they are not </font><font face="SPIonic">memerismenai</font><font>. In this he follows his Origenist predecessor Dionysius, and the language of the present passage is that of Basil or the Gregories. But it is not the language of Athan. himself in his later years. See above, Prolegg. ch. ii. §3 (2) b, and Introd. to <i>Tom. ad Ant.</i> and to <i>Ad Afr.</i> </font></p>

<sup>7 </sup>Assembling in the Churches seems to have been a sort of protest or demonstration, sometimes peaceably, but sometimes in a more exceptionable manner;-peaceably, during Justina's persecution at Milan, Ambros. Ep. i. 20. August. <i>Confess.</i> ix. 15, but at Ephesus after the third Ecumenical Council the Metropolitan shut up the Churches, took possession of the Cathedral, and succeeded in repelling the imperial troops. Churches were asylums, vid. Cod. Theodos. ix. 45. §4. &amp;c.; at the same time arms were prohibited.</p>

<sup>11 </sup>The Prefect of Egypt was called [after 367, see Sievers, p. 119, and Prolegg. ch. v. Appendix, yet see <i>Apol. Ar.</i> §83] Augustalis as having been first appointed by Augustus, after his victories over Antony. He was of the Equestrian, not, as other Prefects, of the Senatorian order. He was the imperial officer, as answering to Propraetors in the Imperial Provinces. vid. Hofman. in voc. [on Philagrius, see <i>Apol. c. Ari.</i> §72, Prolegg. ch. ii. §5 (1) note]. </p>

<sup>14 </sup>The <font face="SPIonic">quoj</font><font> or suffitus of Grecian sacrifices generally consisted of portions of odoriferous trees. vid. Potter. <i>Antiqu.</i> ii. 4. Some translate the word here used (</font><font face="SPIonic">strbilouj</font><font>), "shell-fish."</font></p>
<p><a name="P2549_957021"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Churches, as heathen temples before them, were used for deposits. At the sack of Rome, Alaric spared the Churches and their possessions; nay, be himself transported the costly vessels of St. Peter into his Church.</p>
