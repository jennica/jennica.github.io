</ul><p>But the inheritors of the opinions and impiety of Eusebius and his fellows, the eunuch Leontius<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4818_1918873" id="P4818_1918873" name="P4818_1918873">1</a></sup> , who ought not to remain in communion even as a layman<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4819_1919430" id="P4819_1919430" name="P4819_1919430">2</a></sup> , because he mutilated himself that he might henceforward be at liberty to sleep with one Eustolium, who is a wife as far as he is concerned, but is called a virgin; and George and Acacius, and Theodorus, and Narcissus, who are deposed by the Council; when they heard and saw these things, were greatly ashamed. And when they perceived the unanimity and peace that existed between Athanasius and the Bishops (they were more than four hundred<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4820_1919921" id="P4820_1919921" name="P4820_1919921">3</a></sup> , from great Rome, and all Italy, from Calabria, Apulia, Campania, Bruttia, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and the whole of Africa; and those from Gaul, Britain, and Spain, with the great Confessor Hosius; and also those from Pannonia, Noricum, Siscia, Dalmatia, Dardania, Dacia, Moesia, Macedonia, Thessaly, and all Achaia, and from Crete, Cyprus, and Lycia, with most of those from Palestine, Isauria, Egypt, the Thebais, the whole of Libya, and Pentapolis); when I say they perceived these things, they were possessed with envy and fear; with envy, on account of the communion of so many together; and with fear, lest those who had been entrapped by them should be brought over by the unanimity of so great a number, and henceforth their heresy should be triumphantly exposed, and everywhere proscribed.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P4822_1920769"></a>
<font size="3">29. <i>Relapse of Ursacius and Valens.</i></font></p>
</ul><p>First of all they persuade Ursacius, Valens and their fellows to change sides again, and like dogs<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4824_1920903" id="P4824_1920903" name="P4824_1920903">4</a></sup> to return to their own vomit, and like swine to wallow again in the former mire of their impiety; and they make this excuse for their retractation, that they did it through fear of the most religious Constans. And yet even had there been cause for fear, yet if they had confidence in what they had done, they ought not to have become traitors to their friends. But when there was no cause for fear, and yet they were guilty of a lie, are they not deserving of utter condemnation? For no soldier was present, no Palatine or Notary<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4825_1921466" id="P4825_1921466" name="P4825_1921466">5</a></sup> had been sent, as they now send them, nor yet was the Emperor there, nor had they been invited by any one, when they wrote their recantation. But they voluntarily went up to Rome, and of their own accord recanted and wrote it down in the Church, where there was no fear from without, where the only fear is the fear of God, and where every one has liberty of conscience. And yet although they have a second time become Arians, and then have devised this unseemly excuse for their conduct, they are still without shame.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P4827_1922005"></a>
<font size="3">30. <i>Constantius Changes Sides Again.</i></font></p>
</ul><p>In the next place they went in a body to the Emperor Constantius, and besought him, saying, `When we first made our request to you, we were not believed; for we told you, when you sent for Athanasius, that by inviting him to come forward, you are expelling our heresy. For he has been opposed to it from the very first, and never ceases to anathematize it. He has already written letters against us into all parts of the world, and the majority of men have embraced communion with him; and even of those who seemed to be on our side, some have been gained over by him, and others are likely to be. And we are left alone, so that the fear is, lest the character of our heresy become known, and henceforth both we and you gain the name of heretics. And if this come to pass, you must take care that we be not classed with the Manichaeans. Therefore begin again to persecute, and support the heresy, for it accounts you its king.' Such was the language of their iniquity. And the Emperors when in his passage through the country on his hasty march against Magnentius<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4829_1923105" id="P4829_1923105" name="P4829_1923105">6</a></sup> , he saw the communion of the Bishops with Athanasius, like one set on fire, suddenly changed his mind, and no longer remembered his oaths, but was alike forgetful of what he had written and regardless of the duty he owed his brother. For in his letters to him, as well as in his interview with Athanasius, he took oaths that he would not act otherwise than as the people should wish, and as should be agreeable to the Bishops. But his zeal for impiety caused him at once to forget all these things. And yet one ought not to wonder that after so many letters and so many oaths Constantius had altered his mind, when we remember that Pharaoh of old, the tyrant of Egypt, after frequently promising and by that means obtaining a remission of his punishments, likewise changed, until he at last perished together with his associates.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P4831_1923949"></a>
<font size="3">31. <i>Constantius Begins to Persecute.</i></font></p>
</ul><p>He compelled then the people in every city to change their party; and on arriving at Aries and Milan<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4833_1924086" id="P4833_1924086" name="P4833_1924086">7</a></sup> , he proceeded to act entirely in accordance with the designs and suggestions of the heretics; or rather they acted themselves, and receiving authority from him, furiously attacked every one. Letters and orders were immediately sent hither to the Prefect, that for the future the corn should be taken from Athanasius and given to those who favoured the Arian doctrines, and that whoever pleased might freely insult them that held communion with him; and the magistrates were threatened if they did not hold communion with the Arians. These things were but the prelude to what afterwards took place under the direction of the Duke Syrianus. Orders were sent also to the more distant parts, and Notaries despatched to every city, and Palatines, with threats to the Bishops and Magistrates, directing the Magistrates to urge on the Bishops, and informing the Bishops that either they must subscribe against Athanasius, and hold communion with the Arians, or themselves undergo the punishment of exile, while the people who took part with them were to understand that chains, and insults, and scourgings, and the loss of their possessions, would be their portion. These orders were not neglected, for the commissioners had in their company the Clergy of Ursacius and Valens, to inspire them with zeal, and to inform the Emperor if the Magistrates neglected their duty. The other heresies, as younger sisters of their own<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4834_1925521" id="P4834_1925521" name="P4834_1925521">8</a></sup> , they permitted to blaspheme the Lord, and only conspired against the Christians, not enduring to hear orthodox language concerning Christ. How many Bishops in consequence, according to the words of Scripture, were brought before rulers and kings<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4835_1925796" id="P4835_1925796" name="P4835_1925796">9</a></sup> , and received this sentence from magistrates, `Subscribe, or withdraw from your churches, for the Emperor has commanded you to be deposed!' How many in every city were roughly handled, lest they should accuse them as friends of the Bishops! Moreover letters were sent to the city authorities, and a threat of a fine was held out to them, if they did not compel the Bishops of their respective cities to subscribe. In short, every place and every city was full of fear and confusion, while the Bishops were dragged along to trial, and the magistrates witnessed the lamentations and groans of the people.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P4837_1926416"></a>
<font size="3">32. <i>Persecution by Constantius.</i></font></p>
</ul><p>Such were the proceedings of the Palatine commissioners; on the other hand, those admirable persons, confident in the patronage which they had obtained, display great zeal, and cause some of the Bishops to be summoned before the Emperor, while they persecute others by letters, inventing charges against them; to the intent that the one might be overawed by the presence of Constantius, and the other, through fear of the commissioners and the threats held out to them in these pretended accusations, might be brought to renounce their orthodox and pious opinions. In this manner it was that the Emperor forced so great a multitude of Bishops, partly by threats, and partly by promises, to declare, `We will no longer hold communion with Athanasius.' For those who came for an interview, were not admitted to his presence, nor allowed any relaxation, not so much as to go out of their dwellings, until they had either subscribed, or refused and incurred banishment thereupon. And this he did because he saw that the heresy was hateful to all men. For this reason especially he compelled so many to add their names to the small number<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4839_1927582" id="P4839_1927582" name="P4839_1927582">10</a></sup> of the Arians, his earnest desire being to collect together a crowd of names, both from envy of the Bishop, and for the sake of making a shew in favour of the Arian impiety, of which he is the patron; supposing that he will be able to alter the truth, as easily as he can influence the minds of men. He knows not, nor has ever read, how that the Sadducees and the Herodians, taking unto them the Pharisees, were not able to obscure the truth; rather it shines out thereby more brightly every day, while they crying out, `We have no king but Caesar<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4840_1928179" id="P4840_1928179" name="P4840_1928179">11</a></sup> ,' and obtaining the judgment of Pilate in their favour, are nevertheless left destitute, and wait in utter shame, expecting shortly<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4841_1928352" id="P4841_1928352" name="P4841_1928352">12</a></sup> to become bereft, like the partridge<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4842_1928451" id="P4842_1928451" name="P4842_1928451">13</a></sup> , when they shall see their patron near his death.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P4844_1928524"></a>
<font size="3">33. <i>Persecution is from the Devil</i></font></p>
</ul><p>Now if it was altogether unseemly in any of the Bishops to change their opinions merely from fear of these things, yet it was much more so, and not the part of men who have confidence in what they believe, to force and compel the unwilling. In this manner it is that the Devil, when he has no truth on his side<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4846_1928869" id="P4846_1928869" name="P4846_1928869">14</a></sup> , attacks and breaks down the doors of them that admit him with axes and hammers<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4847_1929028" id="P4847_1929028" name="P4847_1929028">15</a></sup> . But our Saviour is so gentle that He teaches thus, `If any man wills to come after Me,' and, `Whoever wills to be My disciple<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4848_1929180" id="P4848_1929180" name="P4848_1929180">16</a></sup> ;' and coming to each He does not force them, but knocks at the door and says, `Open unto Me, My sister, My spouse<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4849_1929315" id="P4849_1929315" name="P4849_1929315">17</a></sup> ;' and if they open to Him, He enters in, but if they delay and will not, He departs from them. For the truth is not preached with swords or with darts, nor by means of soldiers; but by persuasion and counsel. But what persuasion is there where fear of the Emperor prevails? or what counsel is there, when he who withstands them receives at last banishment and death? Even David, although he was a king, and had his enemy in his power, prevented not the soldiers by an exercise of authority when they wished to kill his enemy, but, as the Scripture says, David persuaded his men by arguments, and suffered them not to rise up and put Saul to death<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4850_1929980" id="P4850_1929980" name="P4850_1929980">18</a></sup> . But he, being without arguments of reason, forces all men by his power, that it may be shewn to all, that their wisdom is not according to God, but merely human, and that they who favour the Arian doctrines have indeed no king but Caesar; for by his means it is that these enemies of Christ accomplish whatsoever they wish to do. But while they thought that they were carrying on their designs against many by his means, they knew not that they were making many to be confessors, of whom are those who have lately<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4851_1930517" id="P4851_1930517" name="P4851_1930517">19</a></sup> made so glorious a confession, religious men, and excellent Bishops, Paulinus<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4852_1930647" id="P4852_1930647" name="P4852_1930647">20</a></sup> Bishop of Treveri, the metropolis of the Gauls, Lucifer, Bishop of the metropolis of Sardinia, Eusebius of Vercelli in Italy, and Dionysius of Milan, which is the metropolis of Italy. These the Emperor summoned before him, and commanded them to subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold communion with the heretics; and when they were astonished at this novel procedure, and said that there was no Ecclesiastical Canon to this effect, he immediately said, `Whatever I will, be that esteemed a Canon; the "Bishops" of Syria let me thus speak. Either then obey, or go into banishment.'</p>

<font size="3">34. <i>Banishment of the Western Bishops Spread the Knowledge of the Truth.</i></font></p>
</ul><p>When the Bishops heard this they were utterly amazed, and stretching forth their hands to God, they used great boldness of speech against him teaching him that the kingdom was not his, but God's, who had given it to him, Whom also they bid him fear, lest He should suddenly take it away from him. And they threatened him with the day of judgment, and warned him against infringing Ecclesiastical order, and mingling Roman sovereignty with the constitution<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4856_1931790" id="P4856_1931790" name="P4856_1931790">21</a></sup> of the Church, and against introducing the Arian heresy into the Church of God. But he would not listen to them, nor permit them to speak further, but threatened them so much the more, and drew his sword against them, and gave orders for some of them to be led to execution; although afterwards, like Pharaoh, he repented. The holy men therefore shaking off the dust, and looking up to God, neither feared the threats of the Emperor, nor betrayed their cause before his drawn sword; but received their banishment, as a service pertaining to their ministry. And as they passed along, they preached the Gospel in every place and city<sup><a href="footnote/fn48.htm#P4857_1932445" id="P4857_1932445" name="P4857_1932445">22</a></sup> , although they were in bonds, proclaiming the orthodox faith, anathematizing the Arian heresy, and stigmatizing the recantation of Ursacius and Valens. But this was contrary to the intention of their enemies; for the greater was the distance of their place of banishment, so much the more was the hatred against them increased, while the wanderings of these men were but the heralding of their impiety. For who that saw them as they passed along, did not greatly admire them as Confessors, and renounce and abominate the others, calling them not only impious men, but executioners and murderers, and everything rather than Christians?</p>
