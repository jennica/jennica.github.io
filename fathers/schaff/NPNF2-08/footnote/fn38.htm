<sup>2 </sup>On a proposed meeting of bishops, with an allusion to the consecration of the younger Gregory.</p>
<p><a name="P3834_1242181"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>Tillemont supposes the reference to be to Gregory of Nyssa. Maran, however (<i>Vit. Bas</i>. xxiv.), regards this as an error, partly caused by the introduction into the text of the word <font face="SPIonic">e'mo/n</font><font>, which he has eliminated; and he points out the Gregory of Nyssa, however unwilling to accept consecration, never objected after it had taken place, and was indeed sent to Nazianzus to console the younger Gregory of that place in his distress under like circumstances. Moreover, Gregory of Nyssa was consecrated n the ordinary manner on the demand of the people and clergy with the assent of the bishops of the province. (<i>cf. Letter</i> ccxxv.) Gregory the younger, however, was consecrated to Sasima without these formalities.</font></p>

<sup>2 </sup><i>cf. Letter</i> ccxiv. On Terentius <i>vide</i> Amm. Marcellinus, xxvii. 12 and xxxi. He was an orthodox Christian, though in favour with Valens. In 372 he was in command of twelve legions in Georgia, and Basil communicates with him about providing bishops for the Armenian Church. According to some manuscripts of <i>Letter</i> cv., <i>q.v</i>., his three daughters were deaconesses. </p>
<p><a name="P3843_1244405"></a>
<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">katagagw/n</font><font>. So six mss., but the Ben. Ed. seem rightly to point out that the invitation never resulted in actual "conducting."</font></p>

<p><a name="P3856_1252860"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>The Ben. note, in answer to the suggested unlikelihood of Basil's being plotted against by his brother, calls attention to the fact that this opposition was due not to want of affection but to want of tact, and compares <i>Letter</i> lviii. on Gregory's foolish falsehood about their uncle.</p>

<sup>3 </sup><font face="SPIonic">tou=j tou= qeou= i 9erwmenouj, presbute/rouj kai\ diako/nouj</font><font>. The Ben. note points out that the words priests and deacons probably crept into the mss., in all of which it is found, from the margin, inasmuch as by </font><font face="SPIonic">i 9erwme/nouj</font><font> and cognate words Basil means the whole clergy. <i>cf.
