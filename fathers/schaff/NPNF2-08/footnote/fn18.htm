The discovery of the <i>Philosophumena</i> of Hippolytus has proved this to be a mistake, and thrown his period back to the close of the second and beginning of the third century. . . . He was in full activity in Rome during the Episcopate of Zephyrinus, a.d. 198-217." Professor Stokes in <i>D.C. Biog</i>. iv. 569. For Basil's views of Sabellianism <i>vide</i> Epp. CCX., CCXIV., CCXXXV. In his <i>Haer. Fab. Conf.</i> ii. 9 Theodoret writes: "Sabellius said that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were one Hypostasis; one Person under three names; and he describes the same now as Father, now as Son, now as Holy Ghost.

<sup>553 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e'n to =j genhtoi=j</font><font>, as in the Bodleian ms. The Benedictine text adopts the common reading </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhtoij</font><font>, with the note, "<i>Sed discrimen illud parvi momenti</i>." If St. Basil wrote </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhtoi=j</font><font>, he used it in the looser sense of mortal: in its strict sense of "begotten" it would be singularly out of place here, as the antithesis of the reference to the Son, who is </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhto/j</font><font>, would be spoilt. In the terminology of theology, so far from being "<i>parvi momenti</i>," the distinction is vital. In the earlier Greek philosophy </font><font face="SPIonic">a'ge/nhtoj</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">a'ge/nnhtoj</font><font> are both used as nearly synonymous to express unoriginate eternal. <i>cf</i>. Plat., <i>Phaed</i>. D., </font><font face="SPIonic">a'rxh\ de\ a'ge/nhto/n</font><font>, with Plat, <i>Tim</i>. 52 A., </font><font face="SPIonic">Toutwn de\ ou!twj e'xo/ntwn o 9mologhte/on e$n me\n ei\nai to kata\ tau'ta\ ei\doj e!xon a'ge/nnhton kai\ a'nw/leqron</font><font>. And the earliest patristic use similarly meant by </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhto/j</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">a'ge/nnhtoj</font><font> created and uncreated, as in Ign., <i>Ad Eph</i>. vii., where our Lord is called </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhto\j kai\ a'ge/nnhtoj. e'n a'ndr o/pw Qeo\j, e'n qana/tw zwh= a'lhqinh/</font><font>. <i>cf</i>. Bp. Lightfoot's note. But "such language is not in accordance with later theological definitions, which carefully distinguished between </font><font face="SPIonic">genhto/j</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhto/j</font><font>. between </font><font face="SPIonic">a'ge/nhtoj</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">a'ge/nnhtoj</font><font>; so that </font><font face="SPIonic">genhto/j, a'ge/nhtoj</font><font>, respectively denied and affirmed the eternal existence, being equivalent to </font><font face="SPIonic">ktisto/j, a!ktistoj</font><font>, , while </font><font face="SPIonic">gennhto/j, a'ge/nnhtoj</font><font> described certain ontological relations, whether in time or in eternity. In the later theological language, therefore, the Son was </font><font face="SPIonic">gennrto/j</font><font> even in His Godhead. See esp. Joann. Damasc., <i>De Fid. Orth</i>. I. 8 (I. p. 135, Lequin), </font><font face="SPIonic">xrh\ ga\r ei/de/nai o!ti to\ a'ge/nhton, dia\ tou= e 9no\j n grafo/menon, to\ a!ktiston h! to\ mh\ geno/menon shmai/nei, to\ de\ a'ge/nnhton, dia\ tw=n du/o nn grafomenon, dhloi= to\ mh\ gennhqe/n</font><font>; whence he draws the conclusion that </font><font face="SPIonic">mo/noj o 9 path\o a'ge/nnhtoj</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">mo/noj o 9 ui'o\j gennhto/j</font><font>." Bp. Lightfoot, <i>Ap. Fathers</i>, Pt. II. Vol. II. p. 90, where the history of the worlds is exhaustively discussed. At the time of the Arian controversy the Catholic disputants were chary of employing these terms, because of the base uses to which their opponents put them; so St. Basil, <i>Contra Eunom</i>. iv. protests against the Arian argument </font><font face="SPIonic">ei/ a'ge/nnhtoj o' path\r gennhto\j de\ o' ui/oj, ou'siaj</font><font>.</font></p>

<sup>563 </sup>The genuineness of this latter portion of the Treatise was objected to by Erasmus on the ground that the style is unlike that of Basil's soberer writings. Bp. Jeremy Taylor follows Erasmus (Vol. vi. ed. 1852, p. 427). It was vindicated by Casaubon, who recalls St. John Damascene's quotation of the <i>Thirty Chapters to Amphilochius</i>. Mr. C. F. H. Johnston remarks, "The later discovery of the Syriac Paraphrases of the whole book pushes back this argument to about one hundred years from the date of St. Basil's writing. The peculiar care taken by St. Basil for the writing out of the treatise, and for its safe arrival in Amphilochius' hands, and the value set upon it by the friends of both, make the forgery of half the present book, and the substitution of it for the original within that period, almost incredible." Section 66 is quoted as an authoritative statement on the right use of Tradition "as a guide to the right understanding of Holy Scripture, for the right ministration of the Sacraments, and the preservation of sacred rights and ceremonies in the purity of their original institution," in Philaret's <i>Longer Catechism of the Eastern Church</i>.</p>
<p>St. Basil is, however, strong on the supremacy of Holy Scripture, as in the passages quoted in Bp. H. Browne, <i>On the xxxix Articles</i>: "Believe those things which are written; the things which are not written seek not." (<i>Hom. xxix. adv. Calum. S. Trin.)</i> "It is a manifest defection from the faith, and a proof of arrogance, either to reject anything of what is written, or to introduce anything that is not." (<i>De Fide.</i> i.) <i>cf</i>. also Letters CV. and CLIX. On the right use of Tradition <i>cf</i>. Hooker, <i>Ecc. Pol</i>. lxv. 2, "Lest, therefore, the name of tradition should be offensive to any, considering how far by some it hath been and is abused, we mean by traditions ordinances made in the prime of Christian Religion, established with that authority which Christ hath left to His Church for matters indifferent, and in that consideration requisite to be observed, till like authority see just and reasonable causes to alter them. So that traditions ecclesiastical are not rudely and in gross to be shaken off, because the inventors of them were men."</p>
<p><i>cf</i>. Tert., <i>De Praes </i>. 36, 20, 21, "<i>Constat omnem doctrinam quae cum illis eccleiis apostolicis matricibus et originalibus fedei conspiret veritai deputandam, id sine dubio tenentem quod ecclesiae ab apostolis, apostoli a Christo, Christus a Deo accepit </i>." <i>Vide</i> Thomasius, <i>Christ. Dogm</i>. I. 105. </p>

<sup>564 </sup><font face="SPIonic">tw/n e'n th= Ekklhsi/a pefnlagme/nwn donma/twn kai\ khrugma/twn</font><font>." To give the apparent meaning of the original seems impossible except by some such paraphrase as the above. In Scripture </font><font face="SPIonic">do/gma</font><font>, which occurs five times (Luke ii. 1, Acts xvi. 4, xvii. 7, Eph. ii. 15, and Col. ii 14), always has its proper sense of decree or ordinances. <i>cf</i>. Bp. Lightfoot, on Col. ii. 14, and his contention that the Greek Fathers generally have mistaken the force of the passage in understanding </font><font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font><font> in both Col. and Eph. to mean the doctrines and precepts of the Gospel. </font><font face="SPIonic">Kh/rugma</font><font> occurs eight times (Matt. xii. 41, Luke xi. 32, Rom. xvi. 25, 1 Cor. i. 21, ii. 4, xv. 14, 2 Tim iv. 17, and Tit. i. 3), always in the sense of preaching or proclamation.</font></p>
<p>"The later Christian sense of <font face="SPIonic">do/gma</font>, meaning <i>doctrine</i>, came from its secondary classical use, where it was applied to the authoritative and categorical 'sentences' of the philosophers: <i>cf</i>. Just. Mart., <i>Apol</i>. i. 7. <font face="SPIonic">oi/ e'!/ Ellhsi tu\ au'toi=j a'restu\oogmati/sa/tej e'k panto/j tw= eni\ ono/mati filosof aj prosagoreu/onta, kai/per tu.n dogma/twn e'nanti/wn o!ntwn</font>." [All the sects in general among the Greeks are known by the common name of philosophy, through their doctrines are different.] Cic., <i>Acad</i>. ii. 19. '<i>De suis decretis quae philosophi vocant</i> <font face="SPIonic">dogmata</font>.' . . . There is an approach towards the ecclesiastical meaning in Ignat., <i>Mag</i>. 13, <font face="SPIonic">bebaiwdh=sai e'n toi=j do/gmasi tou= kuri/ou kai\ tw=n apostolwn</font>." Bp. Lightfoot in Col. ii. 14. The "doctrines" of heretics are also called <font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font>, as in Basil, <i>Ep</i>. CCLXI. and Socr., <i>E. H.</i> iii. 10. <i>cf</i>. Bp. Bull, <i>in Serm</i>. 2, "The dogmata or tenets of the Sadducees." In Orig., <i>c. Cels</i>. iii. p. 135, Ed. Spencer, 1658, <font face="SPIonic">do/gma</font> is used of the gospel or teaching of our Lord.</p>
<p>The special point about St. Basil's use of <font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font> is that he uses the word of doctrines and practices privately and tacitly sanctioned in the Church (like <font face="SPIonic">apo/rrhta</font>, which is used of the esoteric doctrine of the Pythagoreans, Plat., <i>Phaed</i>. 62.B.), while he reserves <font face="SPIonic">khru/gmata</font> for what is now often understood by <font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font>, <i>i.e</i>. "<i>legitima synodo decreta</i>." <i>cf. Ep. LII</i>., where he speaks of the great <font face="SPIonic">kh/rugma</font> of the Fathers at Nicaea. In this he is supported by Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria, 579-607, of whom Photius (<i>Cod</i>. ccxxx. Migne Pat. Gr. ciii. p. 1027) writes, "In this work," <i>i.e</i>. Or. II. "he says that of the doctrines (<font face="SPIonic">didagma/twn</font>) handed down in the church by the ministers of the word, some are <font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font>, and others <font face="SPIonic">khru/gmata</font>. The distinction is that <font face="SPIonic">do/gmata</font> are announced with concealment and prudence, and are often designedly compassed with obscurity, in order that holy things may not be exposed to profane persons nor pearls cast before swine. <font face="SPIonic">Khru/gmata</font>, on the other hand, are announced without any concealment." So the Benedictine Editors speak of Origen (<i>c. Cels</i>. i. 7) as replying to Celsus, "<i>praedicationem Christianorum toti orbi notiorem essquam placita philosophorum: sed tamen fatetur, ut opud philosophos, ita etiam apud Christianos nonulla esse veluti interiora, quae post exteriorem et propositam omnibus doctrinam tradantur</i>." Of <font face="SPIonic">khru/gata</font> they note, "<i>Videntur hoc nomine designari leges ecclesiasticae et canonum decreta quae promulgari in ecclesia mos erat, ut neminem laterent</i>." Mr. C. F. H. Johnston remarks: "The <font face="SPIonic">o 9uoou/sion</font>, which many now-a-days would call the Nicene dogma (<font face="SPIonic">tu\ tou= o 9moonsi/on do/gmata</font>, Soc., <i>E.H.</i> iii. 10) because it was put forth in the Council of Nicaea, was for that reason called not <font face="SPIonic">do/gma</font>, but <font face="SPIonic">kh/rugma</font>, by St. Basil, who would have said that it became the <font face="SPIonic">kh/ougma</font> (definition) of that Council, because it had always been the <font face="SPIonic">do/gma</font> of the Church."</p>
<p>In extra theological philosophy a dogma has all along meant a certainly expressed opinion whether formally decreed or not. So Shaftesbury, <i>Misc. Ref</i>. ii. 2, "He who is certain, or presumes to say he knows, is in that particular whether he be mistaken or in the right a dogmatist." <i>cf</i>. Littré S.V. for a similar use in French. In theology the modern Roman limitation of dogma to decreed doctrine is illustrated by the statement of Abbé Bérgier (<i>Dict de Théol</i>. Ed. 1844) of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. "Or, <i>nous convenons que ce n'est pas un dogme de foi</i>," because, thought a common opinion among Romanists, it had not been so asserted at the Council of Trent. Since the publication of Pius IX's Edict of 1854 it has become, to ultramontanists, a "dogma of faith."</p>

<sup>565 </sup>1 Cor. ii. 7. Whether there is or is not here a conscious reference to St. Paul's words, there seems to be both in the text and in the passage cited an employment of <font face="SPIonic">musth/rion</font><font> in its proper sense of a secret revealed to the initiated.</font></p>

Quemadmodum Irenaeus, cum ait lib. iv. cap. 33:</i> Accipiens panem suum corpus esse confitebatur, et temperamentum calicis suum sanguinem conformavit, <i>non solum mutationem panis et vini in corpus et sanguinem Christi exprimit, sed ipsam etiam Christi asseverationem, quae hanc nobis mutationem persuadet; sic qui corpus Christi in Eucharistia ostendi et repraesentari dicunt, non modo jejuno et exiliter loqui non videntur, sed etiam acriores Christi praesentis adorandi stimulos subjicere. Poterat ergo retineri interpretatio Erasmi: sed quia viris eruditis displicuit, satius visum est quid sentirem in hac nota exponere</i>."</font></p>
<p>This view of the meaning of <font face="SPIonic">a'nadei/knusqai</font> and <font face="SPIonic">a1NA'DEICIj</font> as being equivalent to <font face="SPIonic">poieisn</font> and <font face="SPIonic">poi/hsij</font> is borne out and illustrated by Suicer, S.V. "<i>Ex his jam satis liquere arbitror</i> <font face="SPIonic">a'uadeicai</font> <i>apud Basilium id esse quod alii Graei patres dicunt</i> <font face="SPIonic">poiei=n</font> <i>vel</i> <font face="SPIonic">a'pofai/nein sw=ma xristou=</font>."</p>
<p>It is somewhat curious to find Bellarmine (<i>De Sacr. Euch</i>. iv. § 14) interpreting the prayer to God <font face="SPIonic">eu'logh=sai kai\ a 9lia/j I kai\ a'nadei=cai</font> to mean "ostende <i>per effectum salutarem in mentibus nostris istum panem salutificatum non esse panem vulgarem sed coelestem</i>." </p>
