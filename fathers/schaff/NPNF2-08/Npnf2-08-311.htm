<ul><p><i>To Julianus.</i></p>
</ul><p>How fare you this long while? Have you altogether recovered the use of your hand ? And how do other things prosper? According to your wishes and my prayers ? In accordance with your purposes ?</p>
<p>Where men are readily disposed to change, it is only natural that their lives are not well ordered: but where their minds are fixed, steadfast and unalterable, it follows that their lives should be conformable to their purposes.</p>
<p>True, it is not in the helmsman's power to make a calm when he wishes; but with us. it is quite easy to render our lives tranquil by stilling the storms of passion that surge within, by rising superior to those that assail us from without. The upright man is touched by neither loss, nor sickness, nor the other ills of life; for he walks in heart with God. keeps his gaze fixed upon the future, and easily and lightly weathers the storms that rise from earth.</p>
<p>Be not troubled with the cares of earth. Such men are like fat birds, in vain endowed with flight, that creep like beasts upon the ground. But you-for I have witnessed you in difficulties-are like swimmers racing out at sea.</p>
<p>A single claw reveals the whole lion: so from a slight acquaintance I think I know you fully. And I count it a great thing, that you set some store by me, that I am not absent from your thoughts, but constantly in your recollection.</p>
<p>Now writing is a proof of recollection; and the oftener you write, the better pleased I am. </p>
