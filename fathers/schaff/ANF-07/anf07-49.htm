</ul><p><b>I.</b> Jesus Christ, our God and Saviour, delivered to us the great mystery of godliness, and called both Jews and Gentiles to the acknowledgment of the one and only<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7003_2349028" id="P7003_2349028" name="P7003_2349028">1</a></sup> true God His Father,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7004_2349115" id="P7004_2349115" name="P7004_2349115">2</a></sup> as Himself somewhere says, when He was giving thanks for the salvation of those that had believed, "I have manifested Thy name to men, I have finished the work Thou gavest me; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7005_2349373" id="P7005_2349373" name="P7005_2349373">3</a></sup> and said concerning us to His Father, "Holy Father, although the world has not known Thee, yet have I known Thee; and these have known Thee."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7006_2349535" id="P7006_2349535" name="P7006_2349535">4</a></sup> With good reason did He say to all of us together, when we were perfected concerning those gifts which were given from Him by the Spirit: "Now these signs shall follow them that have believed in my name: they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them: they shall lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7007_2349986" id="P7007_2349986" name="P7007_2349986">5</a></sup> These gifts were first bestowed on us the apostles when we were about to preach the Gospel to every creature, and afterwards were of necessity afforded to those who had by our means believed; not for the advantage of those who perform them, but for the conviction of the unbelievers, that those whom the word did not persuade, the power of signs might put to shame: for signs are not for us who believe, but for the unbelievers, both for the Jews and Gentiles. For neither is it any profit to us to cast out demons, but to those who are so cleansed by the power of the Lord; as the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7008_2350594" id="P7008_2350594" name="P7008_2350594">6</a></sup> Himself somewhere instructs us, and shows, saying: "Rejoice ye, not because the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice, because your names are written in heaven."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7009_2350791" id="P7009_2350791" name="P7009_2350791">7</a></sup> Since the former is done by His power, but this by our good disposition and diligence, yet (it is manifest) by His assistance. It is not therefore necessary that every one of the faithful should cast out demons, or raise the dead, or speak with tongues; but such a one only who is vouchsafed this gift, for some cause which may be advantage to the salvation of the unbelievers, who are often put to shame, not with the demonstration of the world, but by the power of the signs; that is, such as are worthy of salvation: for all the ungodly are not affected by wonders; and hereof God Himself is a witness, as when He says in the law: "With other tongues will I speak to this people, and with other lips, and yet will they by no means believe."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7010_2351550" id="P7010_2351550" name="P7010_2351550">8</a></sup> For neither did the Egyptians believe in God, when Moses had done so many signs and wonders;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7011_2351679" id="P7011_2351679" name="P7011_2351679">9</a></sup> nor did the multitude of the Jews believe in Christ, as they believed Moses, who yet had healed every sickness and every disease among them.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7012_2351841" id="P7012_2351841" name="P7012_2351841">10</a></sup> Nor were the former shamed by the rod which was turned into a living serpent, nor by the hand which was made white with leprosy, nor by the river Nile turned into blood; nor the latter by the blind who recovered their sight, nor by the lame who walked, nor by the dead who were raised.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7013_2352154" id="P7013_2352154" name="P7013_2352154">11</a></sup> The one was resisted by Jannes and Jambres, the other by Annas and Caiaphas.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7014_2352249" id="P7014_2352249" name="P7014_2352249">12</a></sup> Thus signs do not shame all into belief, but only those of a good disposition; for whose sake also it is that God is pleased, as a wise steward of a family, to appoint miracles to be wrought, not by the power of men, but by His own will. Now we say these things, that those who have received such gifts may not exalt themselves against those who have not received them; such gifts, we mean, as are for the working of miracles. For otherwise there is no man who has believed in God through Christ,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7015_2352767" id="P7015_2352767" name="P7015_2352767">13</a></sup> that has not received some spiritual gift: for this very thing, having been delivered from the impiety of polytheism, and having believed in God the Father through Christ,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7016_2353007" id="P7016_2353007" name="P7016_2353007">14</a></sup> this is a gift of God. And the having cast off the veil of Judaism, and having believed that, by the good pleasure of God, His only begotten Son, who was before all ages,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7017_2353238" id="P7017_2353238" name="P7017_2353238">15</a></sup> was in the last time born of a virgin,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7018_2353406" id="P7018_2353406" name="P7018_2353406">16</a></sup> ] without the company of a man, and that He lived as a man, yet without sin, and fulfilled all that righteousness which is of the law; and that, by the permission of God, He who was God the Word endured the cross, and despised the shame; and that He died, and was buried, and rose within three days; and that after His resurrection, having continued forty days with His apostles, and completed His whole constitutions, He was taken up in their sight to His God and Father, who sent Him: he who has believed these things, not at random and irrationally, but with judgment and full assurance, has received the gift of God. So also has He who is delivered from every heresy. Let not, therefore, any one that works signs and wonders judge any one of the faithful who is not vouchsafed the same: for the gifts of God which are bestowed by Him through Christ are various; and one man receives one gift, and another another. For perhaps one has the word of wisdom, and another the word of knowledge;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7019_2354441" id="P7019_2354441" name="P7019_2354441">17</a></sup> another, discerning of spirits; another, foreknowledge of things to come; another, the word of teaching; another, long-suffering; another, continence according to the law: for even Moses, the man of God, when he wrought signs in Egypt, did not exalt himself against his equals: and when he was called a god, he did not arrogantly despise his own prophet Aaron.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7020_2354822" id="P7020_2354822" name="P7020_2354822">18</a></sup> Nor did Joshua the son of Nun, who was the leader of the people after him, though in the war with the Jebusites he had made the sun stand still over against Gibeon, and the moon over against the valley of Ajalon<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7021_2355051" id="P7021_2355051" name="P7021_2355051">19</a></sup> because the day was not long enough for their victory, insult over Phineas or Caleb. Nor did Samuel, who had done so many surprising things, disregard David the beloved of God: yet they were both prophets, and the one was high priest, and the other was king. And when there were only seven thousand holy men in Israel who had not bowed the knee to Baal,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7022_2355419" id="P7022_2355419" name="P7022_2355419">20</a></sup> Elijah alone among them, and his disciple Elisha, were workers of miracles. Yet neither did Elijah despise Obadiah the steward, who feared God, but wrought no signs; nor did Elisha despise his own disciple when he trembled at the enemies.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7023_2355692" id="P7023_2355692" name="P7023_2355692">21</a></sup> Moreover, neither did the wise Daniel who was twice delivered from the mouths of the lions, nor the three children who were delivered from the furnace of fire,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7024_2355869" id="P7024_2355869" name="P7024_2355869">22</a></sup> despise the rest of their fellow-Israelites: for they knew that they had not escaped these terrible miseries by their own might; but by the power of God did they both work miracles, and were delivered from miseries. Wherefore let none of you exalt himself against his brother, though he be a prophet, or though he be a worker of miracles: for if it happens that there be no longer an unbeliever, all the power of signs will thenceforwards be superfluous. For to be pious is from any one's good disposition; but to work wonders is from the power of Him that works them by us: the first of which respects ourselves; but the second respects God that works them, for the reasons which we have already mentioned. Wherefore neither let a king despise his officers that are under him, nor the rulers those who are subject. For where there are none to be ruled over, rulers are superfluous; and where there are no officers, the kingdom will not stand. Moreover, let not a bishop be exalted against his deacons and presbyters, nor the presbyters against the people: for the subsistence of the congregation depends on each other. For the bishops and the presbyters are the priests with relation to the people; and the laity are the laity with relation to the clergy. And to be a Christian is in our own power; but to be an apostle, or a bishop, or in any other such office, is not in our own power, but at the disposal of God, who bestows the gifts. And thus much concerning those who are vouchsafed gifts and dignities.</p>

<font size="3">Concerning Unworthy Bishops and Presbyters.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>II.</b> We add, in the next place, that neither is every one that prophesies holy, nor every one that casts out devils religious: for even Balaam the son of Beor the prophet did prophesy,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7028_2357628" id="P7028_2357628" name="P7028_2357628">23</a></sup> though he was himself ungodly; as also did Caiaphas, the falsely-named high priest.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7029_2357739" id="P7029_2357739" name="P7029_2357739">24</a></sup> Nay, the devil foretells many things, and the demons, about Him; and yet for all that, there is not a spark of piety in them: for they are oppressed with ignorance, by reason of their voluntary wickedness. It is manifest, therefore, that the ungodly, although they prophesy, do not by their prophesying cover their own impiety; nor will those who cast out demons be sanctified by the demons being made subject to them: for they only mock one another, as they do who play childish tricks for mirth, and destroy those who give heed to them. For neither is a wicked king any longer a king, but a tyrant; nor is a bishop oppressed with ignorance or an evil disposition a bishop, but falsely so called, being not one sent out by God, but by men, as Ananiah and Samoeah in Jerusalem, and Zedekiah and Achiah the false prophets in Babylon.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7030_2358623" id="P7030_2358623" name="P7030_2358623">25</a></sup> And indeed Balaam the prophet, when he had corrupted Israel by Baalpeor, suffered punishment;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7031_2358747" id="P7031_2358747" name="P7031_2358747">26</a></sup> and Caiaphas at last was his own murderer; and the sons of Sceva, endeavouring to cast out demons, were wounded by them, and fled away in an unseemly manner;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7032_2358932" id="P7032_2358932" name="P7032_2358932">27</a></sup> and the kings of Israel and of Judah, when they became impious, suffered all sorts of punishments. It is therefore evident how bishops and presbyters, also falsely so called, will not escape the judgment of God. For it will be said to them even now: "O ye priests that despise my name,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7033_2359239" id="P7033_2359239" name="P7033_2359239">28</a></sup> I will deliver you up to the slaughter, as I did Zedekiah and Achiah, whom the king of Babylon fried in a frying-pan," as says Jeremiah the prophet.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7034_2359406" id="P7034_2359406" name="P7034_2359406">29</a></sup> We say these things, not in contempt of true prophecies, for we know that they are wrought in holy men by the inspiration of God, but to put a stop to the boldness of vainglorious men; and add this withal, that from such as these God takes away His grace: for "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7035_2359747" id="P7035_2359747" name="P7035_2359747">30</a></sup> Now Silas and Agabus prophesied in our times;<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7036_2359813" id="P7036_2359813" name="P7036_2359813">31</a></sup> yet did they not equal themselves to the apostles, nor did they exceed their own measures though they were beloved of God.

Thou hast also appointed the station of the winds, which blow when commanded by Thee, and the multitude of the plants and herbs. And Thou hast not only created the world itself, but hast also made man for a citizen of the world, exhibiting him as the ornament of the world; for Thou didst say to Thy Wisdom: "Let us make man according to our image, and according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the heaven."<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7138_2395151" id="P7138_2395151" name="P7138_2395151">94</a></sup> Wherefore also Thou hast made him of an immortal soul and of a body liable to dissolution-the former out of nothing, the latter out of the four elements-and hast given him as to his soul rational knowledge, the discerning of piety and impiety, and the observation of right and wrong; and as to his body, Thou hast granted him five senses and progressive motion: for Thou, O God Almighty, didst by Thy Christ plant a paradise in Eden,<sup><a href="footnote/fn71.htm#P7139_2395602" id="P7139_2395602" name="P7139_2395602">95</a></sup> in the east, adorned with all plants fit for food, and didst introduce him into it, as into a rich banquet. And when Thou madest him, Thou gavest him a law implanted within him, that so he might have at home and within himself the seeds of divine knowledge; and when Thou hadst brought him into the paradise of pleasure, Thou allowedst him the privilege of enjoying all things, only forbidding the tasting of one tree, in hopes of greater blessings; that in case he would keep that command, he might receive the reward of it, which was immortality. But when he neglected that command, and tasted of the forbidden fruit, by the seduction of the serpent and the counsel of his wife, Thou didst justly cast him out of paradise.</p>
<p>Yet of Thy goodness Thou didst not overlook him, nor suffer him to perish utterly, for he was Thy creature; but Thou didst subject the whole creation to him, and didst grant him liberty to procure himself food by his own sweat and labours, whilst Thou didst cause all the fruits of the earth to spring up, to grow, and to ripen. But when Thou hadst laid him asleep for a while, Thou didst with an oath call him to a restoration again, didst loose the bond of death, and promise him life after the resurrection. And not this only; but when Thou hadst increased his posterity to an innumerable multitude, those that continued with Thee Thou didst glorify, and those who did apostatize from Thee Thou didst punish.

A bishop blesses, but does not receive the blessing. He lays on hands, ordains, offers, receives the blessing from bishops, but by no means from presbyters. A bishop deprives any clergyman who deserves deprivation, excepting a bishop; for of himself he has not power to do that. A presbyter blesses, but does not receive the blessing; yet does he receive the blessing from the bishop or a fellow-presbyter. In like manner does he give it to a fellow-presbyter. He lays on hands, but does not ordain; he does not deprive, yet does he separate those that are under him, if they be liable to such a punishment. A deacon does not bless, does not give the blessing, but receives it from the bishop and presbyter: he does not baptize, he does not offer; but when a bishop or presbyter has offered, he distributes to the people, not as a priest, but as one that ministers to the priests. But it is not lawful for any one of the other clergy to do the work of a deacon. A deaconess does not bless, nor perform anything belonging to the office of presbyters or deacons, but only is to keep the doors, and to minister to the presbyters in the baptizing of women, on account of decency. A deacon separates a sub-deacon, a reader, a singer, and a deaconess, if there be any occasion, in the absence of a presbyter. It is not lawful for a sub-deacon to separate either one of the clergy or laity; nor for a reader, nor for a singer, nor for a deaconess, for they are the ministers to the deacons.</p>

If he be slave to one of the faithful, let his master be asked if he can give him a good character. If he cannot, let him be rejected, until he show himself to be worthy to his master. But if he does give him a good character, let him be admitted. But if he be household slave to an heathen, let him be taught to please his master, that the word be not blasphemed. If, then, he have a wife, or a woman hath an husband, let them be taught to be content with each other; but if they be unmarried, let them learn not to commit fornication, but to enter into lawful marriage.

<font size="3">Concerning Drunkards.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>XLIV.</b> Now, when you are invited to their memorials, do you feast with good order, and the fear of God, as disposed to intercede for those that are departed. For since you are the presbyters and deacons of Christ, you ought always to be sober, both among yourselves and among others, that so you may be able to warn the unruly. Now the Scripture says, "The men in power are passionate. But let them not drink wine, lest by drinking they forget wisdom, and are not able to judge aright."<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7341_2453628" id="P7341_2453628" name="P7341_2453628">195</a></sup> Wherefore<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7342_2453665" id="P7342_2453665" name="P7342_2453665">196</a></sup> both the presbyters and the deacons are those of authority in the Church next to God Almighty and His beloved Son.<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7343_2453882" id="P7343_2453882" name="P7343_2453882">197</a></sup> We say this, not they are not to drink at all, otherwise it would be to the reproach of what God has made for cheerfulness, but that they be not disordered with wine. For the Scripture does not say, Do not drink wine; but what says it? "Drink not wine to drunkenness; "and again, "Thorns spring up in the hand of the drunkard."<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7344_2454270" id="P7344_2454270" name="P7344_2454270">198</a></sup> Nor do we say this only to those of the clergy, but also to every lay Christian, upon whom the name of our Lord jesus Christ is called. For to them also it is said, "Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath uneasiness? who hath babbling? who hath red eyes? who hath wounds without cause? Do not these things belong to those that tarry long at the wine, and that go to seek where drinking meetings are?

</ul><p><b>XLVI.</b> Now this we all in common do charge you, that every one remain in that rank which is appointed him, and do not transgress his proper bounds; for they are not ours, but God's. For says the Lord: "He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that heareth me, heareth Him that sent me." And, "He that despiseth you, despiseth me; and he that despiseth me, despiseth Him that sent me."<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7357_2455990" id="P7357_2455990" name="P7357_2455990">203</a></sup> For if those things that are without life do observe good order, as the night, the day, the sun, the moon, the stars, the elements, the seasons, the months, the weeks, the days, and the hours, and are subservient to the uses appointed them, according to that which is said, "Thou hast set them a bound which they shall not pass; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7358_2456368" id="P7358_2456368" name="P7358_2456368">204</a></sup> and again, concerning the sea, "I have set bounds thereto, and have encompassed it with bars and gates; and I said to it, Hitherto shalt thou come, and thou shalt go no farther; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7359_2456567" id="P7359_2456567" name="P7359_2456567">205</a></sup> how much more ought ye not to venture to remove those things which we, according to God's will, have determined for you! But because many think this a small matter, and venture to confound the orders, and to remove the ordination which belongs to them severally, snatching to themselves dignities which were never given them, and allowing themselves to bestow that authority in a tyrannical manner which they have not themselves, and thereby provoke God to anger (as did the followers of Corah and King Uzziah,<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7360_2457106" id="P7360_2457106" name="P7360_2457106">206</a></sup> who, having no authority, usurped the high-priesthood without commission from God; and the former were burnt with fire, and the latter was struck with a leprosy in his forehead); and provoke Christ Jesus to anger, who has made this constitution; and also grieve the Holy Spirit, and make void His testimony: therefore, foreknowing the danger that hangs over those who do such things, and the neglect about the sacrifices and eucharistical offices which will arise from their being impiously offered by those who ought not to offer them; who think the honour of the high-priesthood, which is an imitation of the great High Priest Jesus Christ our King, to be a matter of sport; we have found it necessary to give you warning in this matter also. For some are already turned aside after their own vanity. We say that Moses the servant of God (" to whom God spake face to face, as if a man spake to his friend; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7361_2458049" id="P7361_2458049" name="P7361_2458049">207</a></sup> to whom He said, "I know thee above all men; "to whom He spake directly, and not by obscure methods, or dreams, or angels, or riddles),-this person, when he made constitutions and divine laws, distinguished what things were to be performed by the high priests, what by the priests, and what by the Levites; distributing to every one his proper and suitable office in the divine service. And those things which are allotted for the high priests to do, those might not be meddled with by the priests; and what things were allotted to the priests, the Levites might not meddle with; but every one observed those ministrations which were written down and appointed for them. And if any would meddle beyond the tradition, death was his punishment. And Saul's example does show this most plainly, who, thinking he might offer sacrifice without the prophet and high priest Samuel,<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7362_2458966" id="P7362_2458966" name="P7362_2458966">208</a></sup> drew upon himself a sin and a curse without remedy. Nor did even his having anointed him king discourage the prophet. But God showed the same by a more visible effect in the case of Uzziah,<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7363_2459176" id="P7363_2459176" name="P7363_2459176">209</a></sup> when He without delay exacted the punishment due to this transgression, and he that madly coveted after the high-priesthood was rejected from his kingdom also. As to those things that have happened amongst us, you yourselves are not ignorant of them. For ye know undoubtedly that those that are by us named bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, were made by prayer, and by the laying on of hands; and that by the difference of their names is showed the difference of their employments. For not every one that will is ordained, as the case was in that spurious and counterfeit priesthood of the calves under Jeroboam;<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7364_2459815" id="P7364_2459815" name="P7364_2459815">210</a></sup> but he only who is called of God. For if there were no rule or distinction of orders, it would suffice to perform all the offices under one name. But being taught by the Lord the series of things, we distributed the functions of the high-priesthood to the bishops, those of the priesthood to the presbyters, and the ministration under them both to the deacons; that the divine worship might be performed in purity. For it is not lawful for a deacon to offer the sacrifice, or to baptize, or to give either the greater or the lesser blessing. Nor may a presbyter perform ordination; for it is not agreeable to holiness to have this order perverted. For "God is not the God of confusion,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7365_2460527" id="P7365_2460527" name="P7365_2460527">211</a></sup> that the subordinate persons should tyrannically assume to themselves the functions belonging to their superiors, forming a new scheme of laws to their own mischief, not knowing that "it is hard for them to kick against the pricks; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7366_2460814" id="P7366_2460814" name="P7366_2460814">212</a></sup> for such as these do not fight against us, or against the bishops, but against the universal Bishop and the High Priest of the Father, Jesus Christ our Lord.<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7367_2461109" id="P7367_2461109" name="P7367_2461109">213</a></sup> High priests, priests, and Levites were ordained by Moses,<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7368_2461224" id="P7368_2461224" name="P7368_2461224">214</a></sup> the most beloved of God. By our Saviour<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7369_2461293" id="P7369_2461293" name="P7369_2461293">215</a></sup> were we apostles, thirteen in number, ordained; and by the apostles I James, and I Clement, and others with us, were ordained, that we may not make the catalogue of all those bishops over again. And in common, presbyters, and deacons, and sub-deacons, and readers, were ordained by all of us. The great High Priest therefore, who is so by nature, is Christ the only begotten; not having snatched that honour to Himself, but having been appointed such by the Father; who being made man for our sake, and offering the spiritual sacrifice to His God and Father, before His suffering gave it us alone in charge to do this, although there were others with us who had believed in Him. But he that believes is not presently appointed a priest, or obtains the dignity of the high-priesthood. But after His ascension we offered, according to His constitution, the pure and unbloody sacrifice; and ordained bishops, and presbyters, and deacons, seven in number: one of which was Stephen,<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7370_2462301" id="P7370_2462301" name="P7370_2462301">216</a></sup> that blessed martyr, who was not inferior to us as to his pious disposition of mind towards God; who showed so great piety towards God, by his faith and love towards our Lord Jesus Christ, as to give his life for Him, and was stoned to death by the Jews, the murderers of the Lord. Yet still this so great and good a man, who was fervent in spirit, who saw Christ on the right hand of God, and the gates of heaven opened, does nowhere appear to have exercised functions which did not appertain to his office of a deacon, nor to have offered the sacrifices, nor to have laid hands upon any, but kept his order of a deacon unto the end. For so it became him, who was a martyr for Christ, to preserve good order. But if some do blame Philip<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7371_2463064" id="P7371_2463064" name="P7371_2463064">217</a></sup> our deacon, and Ananias<sup><a href="footnote/fn73.htm#P7372_2463359" id="P7372_2463359" name="P7372_2463359">218</a></sup> our faithful brother, that the one did baptize the eunuch, and the other me Paul, these men do not understand what we say. For we have affirmed only that no one snatches the sacerdotal dignity to himself, but either receives it from God, as Melchisedec and Job, or from the high priest, as Aaron from Moses. Wherefore Philip and Ananias did not constitute themselves, but were appointed by Christ, the High Priest of that God to whom no being is to be compared.</p>
