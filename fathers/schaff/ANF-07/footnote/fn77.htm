<p><a name="P7702_2524047"></a>
<sup>31 </sup>Matt. vii. 21, loosely quoted.</p>
<p><a name="P7703_2524126"></a>
<sup>32 </sup>[Literally, "in."-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7704_2524391"></a>
<sup>33 </sup>[A defect in A was thus supplied, but "these" is now accepted; so C, S.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7705_2524498"></a>
<sup>34 </sup>Some read "God." ["Him" is correct.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7706_2524771"></a>
<sup>35 </sup>Or, "with Me." [This is the more exact rendering of <font face="SPIonic">met' e0mou=</font> .-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7707_2525019"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>The first part of this sentence is not found in Scripture; for the second, comp. Matt. vii. 23, Luke xiii. 27. [The first part is not even identified as a citation from an apocryphal book.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7711_2525483"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>Matt. x. 16.</p>
<p><a name="P7712_2525539"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>No such conversation is recorded in Scripture. [Comp. note 13.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7713_2525747"></a>
<sup>39 </sup>Or, "Let not the lambs fear."</p>
<p><a name="P7714_2525982"></a>
<sup>40 </sup>Matt. x. 28; Luke xii. 4, 5.</p>
<p><a name="P7715_2526030"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>Or, "know."</p>
<p><a name="P7716_2526245"></a>
<sup>42 </sup>The text and translation are here doubtful. [All doubt has been removed; the above rendering is substantially correct.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7717_2526655"></a>
<sup>43 </sup>[More exactly, "the righteous path," <font face="SPIonic">th=j o9douj th=j dikai/aj</font>.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7721_2526855"></a>
<sup>44 </sup>Matt. vi. 24; Luke xvi. 13.</p>
<p><a name="P7722_2527051"></a>
<sup>45 </sup>Matt. xvi. 26. [The citation is not exactly according to any evangelist. Literally, "For what advantage is it, if any one gain the whole (C omits `whole0') world, but forfeit his life," or "soul."-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7723_2527316"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>Literally, "speaks of." [So Lightfoot.-R].</p>
<p><a name="P7724_2527549"></a>
<sup>47 </sup>Or, "enjoy." [Lightfoot: "but must bid farewell to the one and hold companionship with the other;" thus preserving the correspondence with the preceding sentence.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7725_2527749"></a>
<sup>48 </sup>The ms. has, "we reckon." [So C and S, but Lightfoot retains the subjunctive.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7726_2528297"></a>
<sup>49 </sup>Ezek. xiv. 14, 20. </p>
<p><a name="P7727_2528357"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>[Literally, "But if even such righteous men."-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7728_2528494"></a>
<sup>51 </sup>Literally, "with what confidence shall we."</p>
<p><a name="P7729_2528574"></a>
<sup>52 </sup>Wake translates "kingdom," as if the reading had been <font face="SPIonic">basilei/an</font>; but the ms. has <font face="SPIonic">basi/leion</font>, "palace." [Lightfoot gives the former rendering, though accepting <font face="SPIonic">basi/leion</font>.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7730_2528908"></a>
<sup>53 </sup>[Literally, "holy and righteous works."-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7734_2529054"></a>
<sup>54 </sup>[<font face="SPIonic">a0gwniswmeqa</font>, "let us strive," as in the games.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7735_2529262"></a>
<sup>55 </sup>Literally, "that many set sail for corruptible contests," referring probably to the concourse at the Isthmian games.</p>
<p><a name="P7736_2529552"></a>
<sup>56 </sup>Or, "Let us place before us." [The latter rendering is that of the reading found in A and C, and now accepted by many editors (<font face="SPIonic">qw=men</font>); but Lightfoot adheres to <font face="SPIonic">qe/wmen</font> (so S), and holds the former reading to be a corruption.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7737_2529868"></a>
<sup>57 </sup>Or, "set sail."</p>
<p><a name="P7738_2530033"></a>
<sup>58 </sup>Literally, "know."</p>
<p><a name="P7739_2530137"></a>
<sup>59 </sup>Literally "if he be found corrupting."</p>
<p><a name="P7740_2530391"></a>
<sup>60 </sup>Baptism is probably meant. [See Eph. i. 13 and Acts xix. 6.]</p>
<p><a name="P7741_2530488"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>[Or, "He saith;" "unbroken" is not necessary.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7742_2530653"></a>
<sup>62 </sup>Isa. lxvi. 24.</p>
<p><a name="P7746_2531733"></a>
<sup>63 </sup>Comp. Luke xvi. 10-12.</p>
<p><a name="P7747_2531844"></a>
<sup>64 </sup>ms. has "we," which is corrected by all editors as above. [The newly discovered authorities have the second person; most recent editors, however, adopt the first person, as <i>lectio difficilior</i>. So Lightfoot; but Hilgenfeld restores <font face="SPIonic">a0pola/bhte</font> in his second edition.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7748_2532146"></a>
<sup>65 </sup>Some have thought this a quotation from an unknown apocryphal book, but it seems rather an explanation of the preceding words.</p>
<p><a name="P7752_2532418"></a>
<sup>66 </sup>[Editors differ as to the punctuation. Lightfoot: "Understand ye. In what were ye saved? In what did ye recover your sight? if ye were not in the flesh." Hilgenfeld puts a comma after <font face="SPIonic">gnw=te</font> (understand ye), and a period after <font face="SPIonic">e0sw/qhte</font> (saved).-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7753_2532729"></a>
<sup>67 </sup>Literally, "looked up." [Both senses of <font face="SPIonic">a0nable/pein</font> occur in New Testament.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7754_2533002"></a>
<sup>68 </sup>The ms. has <font face="SPIonic">ei[j</font>, "one," which Wake follows, but it seems clearly a mistake for <font face="SPIonic">w0j</font>. [Lightfoot reads <font face="SPIonic">ei</font>,with a Syriac fragment; both C and S have <font face="SPIonic">ei[j</font>-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7755_2533216"></a>
<sup>69 </sup>[C has here the curious reading <font face="SPIonic">lo/goj</font> instead of <font face="SPIonic">pneu=ma</font>, but all editors retain the latter.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7756_2533773"></a>
<sup>70 </sup>[A reads "eternal," and C, S, "praise;" Lightfoot and others combine the two, "eternal praise,"-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7757_2534036"></a>
<sup>71 </sup>Matt. xii. 50.</p>
<p><a name="P7761_2534222"></a>
<sup>72 </sup>Literally, "rather." </p>
<p><a name="P7762_2534304"></a>
<sup>73 </sup>Literally, "malice, as it were, the precursor of our sins." Some deem the text corrupt.</p>
<p><a name="P7763_2534607"></a>
<sup>74 </sup>Literally, according to the ms., "it is not possible that a man should find it who <i>are</i>"-the passage being evidently corrupt. [The evidence of C and S does not clear up the difficulty here, the reading of these authorities being substantially that of A. Lightfoot renders: "For for this cause is a man unable to attain happiness, seeing that they call in the fears of men," etc. Hilgenfeld (2d ed.) assumes here a considerable gap in all the authorities, and inserts two paragraphs, cited in other authors as from Clement. The first and longer passage is from John of Damascus, and it may be accounted for as a loose citation from chap. xx. in the recovered portion of this Epistle. The other is from pseudo-Justin (<i>Questions to the Orthodox</i>, 74) This was formerly assigned by both Hilgenfeld and Lightfoot (against Harnack) to the <i>First Epistle of Clement</i>, lviii., in that portion wanting in A. But the recovered chapters (lviii.-lxiii.) contain, according to C and S, no such passage. Lightfoot thinks the reference in pseudo-Justin is to chap. xvi. of this homily, and that the mention of the Sibyl in the same author is not necessarily part of the citation from Clement. Comp. Lightfoot, pp. 308, 447, 448, 458, 459, and Hilgenfeld, 2d ed., pp. xlviii., 77.-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7764_2536269"></a>
<sup>75 </sup>[Lightfoot, more literally, "but now they continue teaching evil to innocent souls."-R.]</p>
<p><a name="P7768_2537248"></a>
<sup>76 </sup>The same words occur in Clement's first epistle, chap. xxiii.</p>
<p><a name="P7769_2537750"></a>
<sup>77 </sup>1 Cor. ii. 9.</p>
<p><a name="P7773_2538178"></a>
<sup>78 </sup>These words are quoted (Clem. Alex., <i>Strom.</i>, iii. 9, 13) from the Gospel according to the Egyptians, no longer extant.</p>
<p><a name="P7774_2538704"></a>
<sup>79 </sup>Thus ends the ms., but what followed will be found in Clem. Alex. as just cited.</p>
<p><a name="P7777_2538832"></a>
<sup>80 </sup>For details respecting the version here given, see Introductory Notice, pp. 514, 515.</p>
<p><a name="P7779_2538935"></a>
<sup>81 </sup>Or, more correctly, both here and above, "by this He meaneth."</p>
<p><a name="P7780_2539055"></a>
<sup>82 </sup>All editors read <font face="SPIonic">ou0de\n fronh=</font>, but C has <font face="SPIonic">fronei=</font> which is ungrammatical. In this clause, after <font face="SPIonic">i#na</font> we would expect <font face="SPIonic">mhden</font>; butas Lightfoot suggests, <font face="SPIonic">ou0se\n</font> may be combined as a substantive idea with <font face="SPIonic">qhluko/n</font>; comp. the use of <font face="SPIonic">ou0</font> with participles.</p>
<p><a name="P7781_2539345"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>For <font face="SPIonic">mhde/</font> (so C) Gebhardt would substitute <font face="SPIonic">mhd' h#de</font>, while S supplies in full, <i>quum soror videbit fratrem</i>, an obvious interpretament.</p>
<p><a name="P7782_2539557"></a>
<sup>84 </sup>This seems to be an explanation of the saying above referred to, and not a citation; similar cases occur in the homily.</p>
<p><a name="P7785_2539782"></a>
<sup>85 </sup>The headings to the chapters have been supplied by the editor, but in so rambling a discourse they are in some cases necessarily unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><a name="P7787_2539953"></a>
<sup>86 </sup>Hilgenfeld reads <font face="SPIonic">mou</font> instead of <font face="SPIonic">ou[n</font>; so S apparently. The chapters are usually introduced with <font face="SPIonic">ou[n</font> (nine times) or <font face="SPIonic">wste</font> (five times).</p>
<p><a name="P7788_2540312"></a>
<sup>87 </sup><font face="SPIonic">gimw/meqa</font>; Lightfoot, "be found."</p>
<p><a name="P7789_2540411"></a>
<sup>88 </sup>Literally, "ourselves," <font face="SPIonic">e9autoi=j</font>; but the reciprocal sense is common in Hellenistic Greek, and is here required by the context.</p>
<p><a name="P7790_2540616"></a>
<sup>89 </sup>Comp. Acts v. 41, where the correct text omits <font face="SPIonic">au\tou=</font>. The Revised Version properly capitalizes "Name" in that passage. </p>
<p><a name="P7791_2540779"></a>
<sup>90 </sup>C here, and in many other cases, reads <font face="SPIonic">u9ma=j</font>; comparison of mss. shows that it is a correction of the scribe.</p>
<p><a name="P7792_2540932"></a>
<sup>91 </sup>Lightfoot renders <font face="SPIonic">dia\ panto/j</font>, "every way;" but the temporal sense is common in Hellenistic Greek, and here required by the Hebrew.</p>
<p><a name="P7793_2541117"></a>
<sup>92 </sup>Isa. lii. 5, with <font face="SPIonic">pasi=n</font> inserted.</p>
<p><a name="P7794_2541173"></a>
<sup>93 </sup>Lightfoot reads, <font face="SPIonic">kai\ pa/lin Ou0ai/</font>, following the Syriac. C has <font face="SPIonic">kai Dio/</font>. There is difficulty in identifying this second quotation: comp. Ezek. xxxvi. 20-23. Lightfoot thinks it probable that the preacher used two different forms of Isa. lii. 5.</p>
<p><a name="P7795_2541534"></a>
<sup>94 </sup>This sentence is not part of the citation, but an explanation, the words being used as if spoken by God. The Syriac text seeks to avoid this difficulty by reading, "by our not doing what we say."</p>
<p><a name="P7796_2541803"></a>
<sup>95 </sup>Here <font face="SPIonic">ta\ lo/gia to= Qeou=</font> is used of the Scriptures, and with distinct reference to the New Testament; see next note.</p>
<p><a name="P7797_2542179"></a>
<sup>96 </sup>In view of the connection, this must mean "God in His oracles;" a significant testimony to the early belief in the inspiration of the Gospels.</p>
<p><a name="P7798_2542466"></a>
<sup>97 </sup>Luke vi. 27, 32, freely combined; comp. Matt. v. 44, 46. The use of <font face="SPIonic">xa/rij u0min</font> shows that the quotation is from the former Gospel.</p>
