<sup>25 </sup>In another ms. that prayer begins thus:-</p>
<p>O Lord God Almighty, hear the voice of my cry before Thee at this time. Give ear, O Lord, and hear my groanings before Thy majesty, and accept the entreaty of me, a sinner, with which I call upon Thy grace, at this hour at which the sacrifice is offered to Thy Father. Have mercy on all creatures; spare the guilty; convert the erring; restore the oppressed; on the disquieted bestow rest; heal the weak; console the afflicted; and perfect the alms of those who work righteousness on account of Thy holy name. Have mercy on me also, a sinner, through Thy grace. O Lord God Almighty, may this oblation be accepted for the entire Holy Catholic Church; and for priests, kings, princes, <i>and the rest as above.</i> </p>

<sup>35 </sup>[So the true reading (Badger), though Edinburgh editors follow the illogical emendation (<i>jucundum</i>) of Renaudot.] </p>

<sup>36 </sup>[The reference to John vi. 32-40 is clear ]</p>
<p><a name="P8879_2712920"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>In another ms. there is a different reading:-"Glory to Thee, O God the Father, who didst send Thine only-begotten Son for our salvation, and He Himself before He suffered," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P8881_2713107"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>In the ms. of Elias, which we have followed, there is a defect, seeing that the whole recitation of the words of Christ is omitted through the fault of the transcriber, or because these ought to have been taken from another source, namely, from the Liturgy of Theodorus or Nestorius. In that which the Patriarch Joseph wrote at Rome, 1697, that entire passage is remodelled according to the Chaldean missal published at Rome, as in the mass, a translation of which was edited by Alexius Menesius. Since there were no other codices at hand, in this place it seemed good to place asterisks to indicate the defects.</p>

<sup>43 </sup>In another ms.:-<i>He signs his forehead with the sign of the cross, and says:</i>-Glory to Thee, O Lord, who didst create me by Thy grace. Glory to Thee, O Lord, who didst call me by Thy mercy. Glory to Thee, O Lord, who didst appoint me the mediator of Thy gift; and on account of all the benefits to my weakness, ascribed unto Thee be praise, honour, thanksgiving, and adoration, now, etc.</p>
