<sup>176 </sup>3 Made fast, established.</p>

<sup>178 </sup>It was necessary to remove ambiguity from the heathen to whom the word death conveys no such meaning. In the sacred writings the departure of the soul from the body is often spoken of as sleep, or rest. Thus Lazarus is said to sleep. 1 Thess. iv. 14, "Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him,"-an expression of great beauty and propriety as applied to Christians. On the other hand, the prophets speak of "the shadow of death."</p>
<p><a name="P708_288678"></a>
<sup>179 </sup>Extinguishes. Compare the words of Christ Himself, John v. 29; Acts xxiv. 15.</p>

<p><a name="P713_289801"></a>
<sup>183 </sup>It is not to be supposed that Lactantius, following the error of Marcion, believed that the body of man had been formed by the devil, for he has already described its creation by God. He rather speaks of the devil as exercising a power permitted to him over the earth and the bodies of men. Compare 2 Cor. iv. 4.</p>

<sup>184 </sup>Preface to <i>Catiline.</i></p>
<p><a name="P715_291135"></a>
<sup>185 </sup>The word <i>teneo</i> is used in this sense by Cicero (<i>De Nat. Deor.</i>, 11. 54): "Tribus rebus animantium vita tenetur, cibo, potione, spiritu."</p>

<sup>187 </sup>Gen. ii.</p>
<p><a name="P718_291775"></a>
<sup>188 </sup>We are not to understand this as asserting that the man lived in idleness, and without any employment in paradise; for this would be inconsistent with the Scripture narrative, which tells us that Adam was placed there to keep the garden and dress it. It is intended to exclude painful and anxious labour, which is the punishment of sin. See Gen. iii. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P720_292439"></a>
<sup>189 </sup>Paradise.</p>
<p><a name="P721_292604"></a>
<sup>190 </sup>Another reading is, ad <i>dejiciendum</i> hominem, "to overthrow the man."</p>
<p><a name="P722_293227"></a>
<sup>191 </sup>Circumvallavit, "placed a barrier round." See Gen. iii. 24: "He placed at the east of the garden of Eden cherubims, and a flaming sword, which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life."</p>
<p><a name="P723_293866"></a>
<sup>192 </sup>[Not <i>novissima</i>, but <i>extrema</i> here. He refers to book vii. cap. 11, etc.]</p>
<p><a name="P724_294366"></a>
<sup>193 </sup>Temporary. The word is opposed to everlasting.</p>
<p><a name="P725_294488"></a>
<sup>194 </sup>No one actually lived a thousand years. They who approached nearest to it were Methuselah, who lived 969 years, Jared 962, and Noah 950.</p>
<p><a name="P726_294920"></a>
<sup>195 </sup>It appears that the practice of the Egyptians varied as to the computation of the year. </p>

<sup>196 </sup>Philo and Josephus.</p>
<p><a name="P728_295532"></a>
<sup>197 </sup>["Old Parr," born in Shropshire, A.D. 1483, died in 1635: i.e., born before the discovery of America, he lived to the beginning of Hampden's career in England.]</p>
<p><a name="P732_296190"></a>
<sup>198 </sup>The reading is <i>quod</i>, which in construction refers not to the preceding, but to the following substantive. <i>Qui</i> has been suggested as a preferable reading.</p>
<p><a name="P733_296938"></a>
<sup>199 </sup>Lactantius understands the hundred and twenty years (mentioned Gen. vi. 3) as the limit of human life, and regards it as a mark of severity on God's part. But Chrysostom, Jerome, Augustine, and most commentators, regard it rather as a sign of God's patience and long-suffering, in giving them that space for repentance. And this appears to be confirmed by the Apostle Peter, 1 Ep. iii. 20, "When once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing."</p>
<p><a name="P734_297962"></a>
<sup>200 </sup>Ham.</p>
<p><a name="P735_298194"></a>
<sup>201 </sup>Gen. ix. 23.</p>
<p><a name="P736_298622"></a>
<sup>202 </sup>This refers to that prophetic denunciation of divine judgment on the impiety of Ham, which Noah, by the suggestion of the Holy Spirit, uttered against the posterity of the profane man. Gen. ix. 25: "Cursed be Canaan." The curse was not uttered in a spirit of vengeance or impatience on account of the injury received, but by the prophetic impulse of the Divine Spirit. [The prophet fixes on the descendant of Ham, whose <i>impiety</i> was foreseen, and to whom <i>it</i> brought a curse so signal.]</p>
<p><a name="P737_299182"></a>
<sup>203 </sup>[Our author falls into a <i>hysteron-proteron</i>: the curse did not work the ignorance, but wilful ignorance and idolatry wrought the curse, which was merely foretold, not fore-ordained.]</p>

<sup>207 </sup>Substantiae, "essence."</p>
<p><a name="P746_302291"></a>
<sup>208 </sup>See 2 Cor. iv. 4, "the god of this world."</p>
<p><a name="P747_302766"></a>

<p><a name="P749_303194"></a>
<sup>211 </sup><font face="SPIonic">dah/monej</font>. Other derivations have been proposed; but the word probably comes from <font face="SPIonic">dai/w</font>, "to distribute destinies." Plato approves of the etymology given by Lactantius; for he says that good men, distinguished by great honours, after their death became demons, in accordance with this title of prudence and wisdom. [See the whole subject in Lewis' <i>Plato</i>, etc., p. 347. ]</p>
<p><a name="P750_303838"></a>
<sup>212 </sup>To combine, qualify, or temperate.</p>
<p><a name="P753_304741"></a>
<sup>213 </sup>Aspirations.</p>
<p><a name="P754_304843"></a>
<sup>214 </sup>Blinding tricks, juggleries.</p>
<p><a name="P755_305462"></a>
<sup>215 </sup>They lavish. The word implies a profuse and excessive liberality.</p>
<p><a name="P756_305722"></a>
<sup>216 </sup>Thin, unsubstantial, as opposed to corporeal. The ancients inclined to the opinion that angels had a body, not like that of man, but of a slight and more subtle nature. Probably Lactantius refers to this idea in using the word <i>tenuis</i>. How opposed this view is to Scripture is manifest. [Not so <i>maniifest</i> as our translator supposes. I do not assert what Lactantius says to be scripturally correct: but it certainly is not <i>opposed</i> to many facts as Scripture states them; whether figuratively or otherwise, I do not venture a suggestion.]</p>
<p><a name="P760_306676"></a>
<sup>217 </sup>Augustine gives an account of these deceits, <i>De Civit. Dei</i>, ix. 18.</p>
<p><a name="P761_306915"></a>
<sup>218 </sup>Thus the ancient Romans worshipped Fever, Fear, etc., to avoid injury from them. </p>
<p><a name="P762_307292"></a>
<sup>219 </sup>Sacramento.</p>
<p><a name="P763_307350"></a>
<sup>220 </sup>See Acts of Apostles xvi. 18, and xix. 15, 16. In the Gospels the demons say to Jesus, "Art Thou come to torment us before the time?" [Suggestive of 2 Pet. ii. 4.]</p>
<p><a name="P764_307588"></a>
<sup>221 </sup>The practice of exorcism was used in the early ages of the Church, and the faithful were supposed to possess power over demons. See book iv. ch. 27. Justin, Tertullian and other writers attest the same. There were also exorcists in the Jewish synagogues. See Acts xix. 13.</p>
<p><a name="P765_308191"></a>
<sup>222 </sup>Sed. Other editions read <i>et</i>; but the one adopted in the text brings out the meaning more distinctly by contrast = they did not disgrace religion, but their own honour.</p>
<p><a name="P772_310195"></a>
<sup>223 </sup>By their presence.</p>
<p><a name="P773_310800"></a>
<sup>224 </sup>Malefici-evil doers. The word is specially used of enchanters.</p>
<p><a name="P775_311500"></a>
<sup>225 </sup>Book i. ch. vi.</p>
<p><a name="P776_311901"></a>
<sup>226 </sup>Apparitors. The word is especially applied to public servants, as lictors, etc.</p>
<p><a name="P777_312355"></a>
<sup>227 </sup>Surrounded, shut in.</p>
<p><a name="P778_312693"></a>
<sup>228 </sup>Praevaricatores. The word is properly applied to an advocate who is guilty of collusion with his antagonist, and thus betrays his client. </p>
<p><a name="P779_313767"></a>
<sup>229 </sup>Womanly Fortune.</p>
<p><a name="P781_314451"></a>
<sup>230 </sup>Unbelievers.</p>
<p><a name="P782_314548"></a>
<sup>231 </sup>Governments.</p>
<p><a name="P783_314743"></a>
<sup>232 </sup>At their nod, or suggestion.</p>
<p><a name="P784_314937"></a>
<sup>233 </sup>They presage.</p>
<p><a name="P785_315523"></a>
<sup>234 </sup>That which was necessary according to the purpose and arrangement of God.</p>
<p><a name="P786_316072"></a>
<sup>235 </sup>Tensa; a carriage on which the images of the gods were carried to the circus at the Circensian games.</p>
<p><a name="P787_316520"></a>
<sup>236 </sup>Deserved nothing, had nothing worthy of punishment. Varro and Paulus Aemilius were the two consuls who commanded at Cannae. Varro escaped, Paulus was slain.</p>

<p><a name="P793_317422"></a>
<sup>239 </sup>Contempt.</p>
<p><a name="P794_317634"></a>
<sup>240 </sup>They have made old. </p>
<p><a name="P798_318406"></a>
<sup>241 </sup>Jerome says "Great is the anger of God when He does not correct sins, but punishes blindness with blindness. On this very account God sends strong delusion, as St. Paul writes to the Thessalonians, that they should believe a lie, that they all may be damned who have not believed the truth. They are unworthy of the living fountain who dig for themselves cisterns."</p>
