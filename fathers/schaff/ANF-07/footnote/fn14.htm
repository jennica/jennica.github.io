<p><a name="P1403_591713"></a>
<sup>193 </sup>Wisd. ii. 12-22.</p>
<p><a name="P1404_591964"></a>
<sup>194 </sup>In traductionem cogitationum nostrarum. Traductio is sometimes used, as here, to denote exposure to ignominy.</p>
<p><a name="P1405_592211"></a>
<sup>195 </sup>Immutatae sunt.</p>
<p><a name="P1406_592269"></a>
<sup>196 </sup>Nugaces. In the Greek it is <font face="SPIonic">ei0j kibdhlon</font>, as a counterfeit.</p>
<p><a name="P1407_592415"></a>
<sup>197 </sup>Praefert. The Greek has <font face="SPIonic">makari/zei</font>, "deems happy."</p>
<p><a name="P1408_592613"></a>
<sup>198 </sup>Quae ventura sunt illi.</p>
<p><a name="P1409_592734"></a>

<sup>201 </sup>Sordidum.</p>
<p><a name="P1413_594355"></a>
<sup>202 </sup>Ps. lxxii. 6, 7, quoted from the Septuagint,</p>
<p><a name="P1414_594723"></a>
<sup>203 </sup>Sine cujusquam suspicione.</p>
<p><a name="P1415_594834"></a>
<sup>204 </sup>Isa. liii. 1-6.</p>
<p><a name="P1416_594960"></a>
<sup>205 </sup>Annuntiavimus coram ipso sicut pueri; and so the Septuagint, <font face="SPIonic">a0nhggei/lamen e0na/ntion au0tou= w9j paidi/on</font>. It is most difficult to account for this remarkable translation. The meaning of the passage is plain, that the Messiah would spring from an obscure source. [Elucidation III.]</p>
<p><a name="P1417_595479"></a>
<sup>206 </sup>Homo in plagâ positus. The Septuagint, <font face="SPIonic">a!nqrwpoj e0n plhgh=wÖ\n</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1418_595617"></a>
<sup>207 </sup>Aversus est. So also the Septuagint, <font face="SPIonic">a0pe/straptai to\ pro/swpon au0tou=</font>. Some have supposed that there is a reference to lepers, who were compelled to cover their faces. </p>
<p><a name="P1419_595924"></a>
<sup>208 </sup>i.e., for Himself, as though He were bearing the punishment of His own sins.</p>
<p><a name="P1420_596103"></a>
<sup>209 </sup>Infirmatus est.</p>
<p><a name="P1421_596161"></a>
<sup>210 </sup>Doctrina pacis nostrae, "the correction."</p>
<p><a name="P1422_596252"></a>
<sup>211 </sup>Livore ejus nos sanati sumus. The word "livor" properly denotes the blackness arising from a bruise.</p>
<p><a name="P1426_596920"></a>
<sup>212 </sup>Intus inclusam. Another reading is, "Intus inclusâ malitia," with malice shut up within.</p>
<p><a name="P1427_597080"></a>
<sup>213 </sup>Solveret, "He loosened or relaxed."</p>
<p><a name="P1428_597180"></a>
<sup>214 </sup>Non vacaret.</p>
<p><a name="P1429_597242"></a>
<sup>215 </sup>Operans in salutem hominum, "by healing diseases and doing good."</p>
<p><a name="P1430_597426"></a>
<sup>216 </sup>There is no mention of this in the Gospels.</p>
<p><a name="P1431_597618"></a>
<sup>217 </sup>Secesserat: "withdrawn themselves from the teaching of the scribes and Pharisees, and betaken themselves to Christ."</p>
<p><a name="P1432_598049"></a>
<sup>218 </sup>Mic. iv. 2, 3.</p>
<p><a name="P1433_598211"></a>
<sup>219 </sup>Some read, "evincet et deliget validas nationes;" but the reading "deliget" seems to have arisen from a corrupt reading of the Septuagint,-<font face="SPIonic">e0kle/cei</font>, "he shall choose," having been substituted for <font face="SPIonic">ecelegcei</font>, "he shall rebuke."</p>
<p><a name="P1434_598540"></a>
<sup>220 </sup>The scene of the giving of the law is sometimes spoken of as Horeb, as Ex. iii., and sometimes as Sinai, as Ex. xix. The difficulty of discriminating the two is very great. See Stanley's <i>Sinai and Palestine</i> [pp. 29, 32, 36-37, 40-42, etc. Robinson, vol. i. 177, 531.]</p>
<p><a name="P1437_599388"></a>
<sup>221 </sup>Deut. xviii. 17-19.</p>
<p><a name="P1438_599718"></a>
<sup>222 </sup>Ego vindicabo in eum.</p>
<p><a name="P1439_599885"></a>
<sup>223 </sup>Vivam praesentemque legem.</p>
<p><a name="P1440_599974"></a>
<sup>224 </sup>Another reading is, "per Moysen," by Moses.</p>
<p><a name="P1442_600123"></a>
<sup>225 </sup>The quotation is not from Isaiah, but from Jer iv. 3, 4.</p>
<p><a name="P1443_600547"></a>
<sup>226 </sup>Deut. xxx. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P1444_600662"></a>
<sup>227 </sup>i.e., Joshua. See Josh. v. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P1445_601273"></a>
<sup>228 </sup>"Figuram gerebat," typified, or set forth as in a figure.</p>
<p><a name="P1446_601385"></a>
<sup>229 </sup>i.e., Osee, Oshea, or Hoshea, as Joshua was first called. See Num. xiii. 8. [But note Num. xiii. 16. The change was significant. See Pearson <i>On the Creed</i>, art. ii. 125-128. Thus, "Jehovah-Saviour" = Jesus, and the change was prophetic of "the Name which is above every name." Compare Gen. xxxii. 29 and Phil. ii. 9, 10.] </p>
<p><a name="P1447_601953"></a>
<sup>230 </sup>Per figuram nominis. The name Jesus or Joshua signifies a deliverer or saviour. [Nay, more, Jehovah-Salvator, thus: Hoshea + Jah = Jehoshua = Joshua = Jesus.]</p>
<p><a name="P1448_602929"></a>
<sup>231 </sup>Involutum. Thus Seneca: "Non est tibi frons ficta, nec in alienam voluptatem sermo compositus, nec cor involutum."</p>
<p><a name="P1449_603727"></a>
<sup>232 </sup>1 Sam. xvi. 7: "The Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart."</p>
<p><a name="P1451_604121"></a>
<sup>233 </sup>Lutulentum (besmeared with mud) "et immundum." See 2 Pet. ii. 22.</p>
<p><a name="P1452_604224"></a>
<sup>234 </sup>["The swine gorges his acorns, and never looks up to the tree from which they fall," as a parable of nature for swinish men.]</p>
<p><a name="P1453_604591"></a>
<sup>235 </sup>Sedendi vehiculum. "Sedeor" is sometimes used in this sense for riding.</p>
<p><a name="P1454_604815"></a>
<sup>236 </sup>Exuviis, used in the same sense as "pellibus."</p>
<p><a name="P1455_605329"></a>
<sup>237 </sup>Ingurgitat coeno, "plunges into the mire." ["Sus lota in volutabro luti." 2 Pet. ii. 22, Vulgate]</p>
<p><a name="P1456_605741"></a>
<sup>238 </sup>Per figuram. [This <i>Typology</i> has never yet been fully or satisfactorily treated. Yet the volumes of Dr. Fairbairn (<i>Typology of Scripture</i>, Clarks, Edin.) ought to be known to every Bible student.]</p>
<p><a name="P1460_606398"></a>
<sup>239 </sup>Subinde, "from time to time."</p>
<p><a name="P1461_607072"></a>
<sup>240 </sup>Legatus. This title was given, in the time of the Roman emperors, to the governors sent by them into the provinces. Pontius Pilate was procurator of Judea, which was not a separate province, but a dependency of the province of Syria, which was at this time governed by Silanus.</p>
<p><a name="P1462_607534"></a>
<sup>241 </sup>John ii. 19, 20. The forty-six years spoken of were not occupied with the rebuilding of the temple, which was completed in nine years, but with the additional works which Herod the Great and his successors were continually carrying on for the adorning and beautifying of the temple. See Prideaux. [I regret the loose references of the translator, and yet more that the inexorable demands of the press give me time to supply only the more important ones. See <i>Connections</i>, book ix. vol. ii. p. 394.] </p>
<p><a name="P1464_608740"></a>
<sup>242 </sup>[It is probable, that, owing to the perpetual and universal recitation of the Creed, this unhappy name has been more frequently uttered and recalled to human memory than that of any other human being.]</p>
<p><a name="P1465_609035"></a>
<sup>243 </sup>Herod Antipas the tetrarch of Galilee. According to St. Luke (xxiii. 15), Herod agreed with Pilate in declaring the innocency of Jesus.</p>
<p><a name="P1466_609376"></a>
<sup>244 </sup>This statement requires some modification. Pilate did indeed say to the Jews, "Take ye Him, and judge Him according to your law;" but they declared that it was not lawful for them to put any man to death. The punishment was entirely Roman, the mode of death Roman, the executioners Roman soldiers. There were two distinct trials,-one before the Jewish Sanhedrim on a charge of impiety, the other before the Roman governor on a charge of treason.</p>
<p><a name="P1467_609973"></a>
<sup>245 </sup>Punicei coloris. The colour was a kind of red, not purple. [It was mixed with blue, so as to be at once purple and in some reflections scarlet.]</p>
<p><a name="P1468_610361"></a>
<sup>246 </sup>The quaternion of Roman soldiers who carried out the execution.</p>
<p><a name="P1469_610531"></a>
<sup>247 </sup>De tunicâ et pallio. The "tunica" was the inner garment, the "pallium" a mantle or cloak. Thus the proverbial phrase, "tunica proprior pallio." [Vol. iv. p. 13, Elucidation I., this series.]</p>
<p><a name="P1470_611103"></a>
<sup>248 </sup>Gavius was crucified by Verres. [<i>In Verrem</i>, act ii. cap. 62. This event providentially illustrated the extreme wickedness of what was done to our Lord, but so quickened the Roman conscience that it prevented like injustice to St. Paul, although a Roman citizen, over and over again. Acts xvi. 37, 38, and xxii. 24, 25.]</p>
<p><a name="P1471_611941"></a>
<sup>249 </sup>Suffixus.</p>
<p><a name="P1472_612099"></a>
<sup>250 </sup>Tantae affluentiae ubertate. [Compare Cicero (<i>ut supra</i>): Crux, <i>crux</i>! inquam infelici et aerumnoso, qui nunquam istam potestatem viderat comparabatur.]</p>
<p><a name="P1474_612548"></a>
<sup>251 </sup>Isa. l. 5, 6, quoted from the Septuagint.</p>
<p><a name="P1475_612694"></a>
<sup>252 </sup>i.e., of the smiters; Gr. <font face="SPIonic">ei0j r9api/smata</font>, "blows with the hand."</p>
<p><a name="P1476_612876"></a>
<sup>253 </sup>Ps. xxxv. 15, 16. The quotation is from the Septuagint, and differs widely from the authorized English version.</p>
<p><a name="P1477_613008"></a>
<sup>254 </sup>Flagella, said to be used for men deserving the scourge; wicked men.</p>
<p><a name="P1478_613119"></a>
<sup>255 </sup>Super me, "over me."</p>
<p><a name="P1479_613169"></a>
<sup>256 </sup>Ignoraverunt. Others read "ignoravi," I knew it not.</p>
<p><a name="P1480_613306"></a>
<sup>257 </sup>Deriserunt me derisu. So the Greek, <font face="SPIonic">e0cemukthxrisaxn me mukthrismoxn</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1482_613720"></a>
<sup>258 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a9plw=j</font>.</p>
<p><a name="P1484_613878"></a>
<sup>259 </sup>Isa. liii. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P1487_614369"></a>
<sup>260 </sup>Ps. lxix. 21. </p>
<p><a name="P1491_614761"></a>
<sup>261 </sup><font face="SPIonic">paizonta</font>. Another reading is <font face="SPIonic">ptai/onta</font>, which would imply that they regarded Christ as a transgressor.</p>
<p><a name="P1493_615134"></a>
<sup>262 </sup>Justin Martyr quotes this passage in his <i>Dialogue with Trypho</i>, and complains that it had been expunged by the Jews. [See vol. i. p. 234, and remarks of Bishop Kaye, <i>Justin Martyr</i>, p. 44, on passages suppressed by the Jews.]</p>
<p><a name="P1494_615888"></a>
<sup>263 </sup>Negaverunt. Another reading is "necaverunt," they put to death.</p>
<p><a name="P1495_616004"></a>
<sup>264 </sup>Isa. liii. 8-10, 12. The quotation is made from the Septuagint.</p>
<p><a name="P1496_616433"></a>
<sup>265 </sup>Consequetur. In the Greek, <font face="SPIonic">klhronomh/sei</font>, "shall inherit."</p>
<p><a name="P1497_616755"></a>
<sup>266 </sup>Ps. xciv. 21, 22.</p>
<p><a name="P1498_616911"></a>
<sup>267 </sup>Jer. xi. 18, 19. quoted from the Septuagint.</p>
<p><a name="P1499_617059"></a>
<sup>268 </sup>Sine malitiâ. Another reading is "sine maculâ," without spot.</p>
