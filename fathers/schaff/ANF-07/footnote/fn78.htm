<p><a name="P7802_2542893"></a>
<sup>98 </sup><font face="SPIonic">w#ste</font>, as at the beginning of chaps. vii., x.</p>
<p><a name="P7803_2543092"></a>
<sup>99 </sup>Comp. Ps. lxxii.. (LXX. lxxi.) 5, 17.</p>
<p><a name="P7804_2543254"></a>
<sup>100 </sup>Jer. vii. 11. Comp. Matt. xxi. 13; Mark xi. 17; Luke xix. 46.</p>
<p><a name="P7805_2543374"></a>
<sup>101 </sup>Harnack says "The Jewish synagogue is the church of death." Lightfoot, more correctly, accepts a contrast "between mere external membership in the visible body and spiritual communion in the celestial counterpart."</p>
<p><a name="P7806_2543707"></a>
<sup>102 </sup>Comp. Eph. i. 23 and many similar passages.</p>
<p><a name="P7807_2543816"></a>
<sup>103 </sup>Gen. 1. 27; comp. Eph. v. 31-33.</p>
<p><a name="P7808_2543916"></a>
<sup>104 </sup>The reference here is probably to the Old-Testament "books," while the term "Apostles" may mean the New Testament in whole or part. The more direct reference probably is to Genesis and Ephesians.</p>
<p><a name="P7809_2544152"></a>
<sup>105 </sup>Lightfoot inserts in brackets <font face="SPIonic">le/gousin, dh=lon</font>, rendering as above. Hilgenfeld suggests <font face="SPIonic">fasi\n oi#date</font>, "Ye know that the books, etc., say that." Bryennios joins this sentence to the preceding, taking the whole as dependent on <font face="SPIonic">a/gnoei=n</font>. Ropes renders accordingly, making a parenthesis from "for the Scripture" to "the Church." In any case a verb of saying must be supplied, as in the Syriac.</p>
<p><a name="P7810_2544616"></a>
<sup>106 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a!nwqen</font> has a local and a temporal sense; the latter is obviously preferable here.</p>
<p><a name="P7811_2544796"></a>
<sup>107 </sup>"Jesus" is the subject of the latter part of the sentence.</p>
<p><a name="P7812_2544995"></a>
<sup>108 </sup>"Keep her pure;" comp. chap. viii. Lightfoot renders <font face="SPIonic">threi=n</font>, "guard," here and elsewhere.</p>
<p><a name="P7813_2545161"></a>
<sup>109 </sup>The verb corresponds with that rendered "partake" in what follows.</p>
<p><a name="P7814_2545363"></a>
<sup>110 </sup>"Copy," <font face="SPIonic">a!ti/tupoj, a0nti/tupon</font>. Comp. Heb. ix. 24; 1 Pet iii. 21. Our use of "antitype" is different. The antithesis here is <font face="SPIonic">auu/qentiko/n</font>, the original, or archetype. This mystical interpretation has a Platonic basis.</p>
<p><a name="P7815_2545637"></a>
<sup>111 </sup>Comp. the close of chap. viii.</p>
<p><a name="P7816_2545777"></a>
<sup>112 </sup>Lightfoot calls attention to the confusion of metaphors; but there is also evidence of that false exegesis which made "flesh" and "spirit" equivalent to "body" and "soul,"-an error which always leads to further mistakes.</p>
<p><a name="P7817_2546186"></a>
<sup>113 </sup>Here the word "flesh" is used in an ambiguous sense.</p>
<p><a name="P7818_2546371"></a>
<sup>114 </sup>1 Cor. ii. 9.</p>
<p><a name="P7822_2546523"></a>
<sup>115 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri\ e0gkpatei/aj</font>, "temperance" in the wide New-Testament sense. Lightfoot, "continence;" in these days the prominent danger was from libidinous sins.</p>
<p><a name="P7823_2546875"></a>
<sup>116 </sup>Comp. Jas. v. 19, 20, with which our passage has many verbal correspondences.</p>
<p><a name="P7824_2546987"></a>
<sup>117 </sup>"A favorite word with our author, especially in this connection."-Lightfoot.</p>
<p><a name="P7825_2547373"></a>
<sup>118 </sup>Isa. lviii. 9, LXX.</p>
<p><a name="P7826_2547536"></a>
<sup>119 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ei/j to\ dido/nai tou= ai/tou=ntoj</font>; the sense of the elliptical construction is obviously as above. </p>
<p><a name="P7827_2547729"></a>
<sup>120 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0autoi=j</font>. Here again in the reciprocal sense; comp. chap. xiii.</p>
<p><a name="P7831_2548101"></a>
<sup>121 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a0formhn labo/ntej</font>, as in Rom. vii. 8, 11.</p>
<p><a name="P7832_2548198"></a>
<sup>122 </sup><font face="SPIonic">kairo\n e!xontej</font>, "seeing that we have time" (Lightfoot). But "opportunity" is more exact.</p>
<p><a name="P7833_2548402"></a>
<sup>123 </sup><font face="SPIonic">a0potacw/meqa</font>, "bid farewell to;" comp. chap. vi.</p>
<p><a name="P7834_2548648"></a>
<sup>124 </sup>Comp. Mal. iv. 1.</p>
<p><a name="P7835_2548767"></a>
<sup>125 </sup>Comp. Isa. xxxiv. 4, which resembles the former clause, and 2 Pet. iii. 7, 10, where the same figures occur. The text seems to be corrupt: <font face="SPIonic">tinej</font> ("some") is sustained by both the Greek and the Syriac, but this limitation is so peculiar as to awaken suspicion; still, the notion of several heavens might have been in the author's mind.</p>
<p><a name="P7836_2549284"></a>
<sup>126 </sup>Comp. Tobit xii. 8, 9; but the position given to almsgiving seems to be contradicted by the next sentence. Lightfoot seems to suspect a corruption of text here also, but in the early Church there was often an undue emphasis placed upon almsgiving.</p>
<p><a name="P7837_2549580"></a>
<sup>127 </sup>1 Pet. iv. 8. Comp. Prov. x. 12; Jas. v. 20.</p>
<p><a name="P7838_2549787"></a>
<sup>128 </sup>Literally, "becometh a lightener (<font face="SPIonic">kou/fisma</font>) of sin;" comp. Ecclus. iii. 30.</p>
<p><a name="P7842_2550057"></a>
<sup>129 </sup>Lightfoot, with Syriac, reads <font face="SPIonic">i!na kai\ tou=to pra/sswmen</font>. Comits <font face="SPIonic">i!na</font>, and reads <font face="SPIonic">pra/ssomen</font>, "If we have commandments and practice this."</p>
<p><a name="P7843_2550404"></a>
<sup>130 </sup>Here Lightfoot thinks a verb has probably fallen out of the text.</p>
<p><a name="P7844_2550554"></a>
<sup>131 </sup>Bryennios thus connects: "in order that all may be saved, and may convert," etc.</p>
<p><a name="P7845_2550778"></a>
<sup>132 </sup>"This clearly shows that the work before us is a sermon delivered in church"(Lightfoot). The preacher is himself one of "the presbyters;" comp. chap. xix. It is possible, but cannot be proven, that he was the head of the presbyters, the parochial bishop.</p>
<p><a name="P7846_2551069"></a>
<sup>133 </sup><font face="SPIonic">e0ntalma/twn</font>, not the technical word for the commandments of the Decalogue (<font face="SPIonic">e0ntolai</font>).</p>
<p><a name="P7847_2551236"></a>
<sup>134 </sup>Syriac, "praying," which Lightfoot thinks may be correct; but <font face="SPIonic">proserxo/menoi</font> might very easily be mistaken for <font face="SPIonic">proseuxo/menoi</font>. The former means coming in worship: comp. Heb. x. 1, 22.</p>
<p><a name="P7848_2551543"></a>
<sup>135 </sup>2 Cor. xiii. 11; Phil. ii. 2.</p>
<p><a name="P7849_2551704"></a>
<sup>136 </sup>Isa. lxvi. 18. But "tribes" is inserted; comp. Dan. iii. 7. The phrase "shall see His glory" is from the passage in Isaiah, The language seems to be put into the mouth of Christ by the preacher.</p>
<p><a name="P7850_2552019"></a>
<sup>137 </sup>This implies various degrees of reward among these redeemed.</p>
<p><a name="P7851_2552206"></a>
<sup>138 </sup><font face="SPIonic">to\ basi/leion</font>; not exactly "the kingdom," rather "the kingly rule." <font face="SPIonic">e0n tw= 'Ihsou=</font> is rightly explained by Lightfoot, "in the hands, in the power, of Jesus;" <font face="SPIonic">cenisqhontai</font> is rendered above "shall think it strange," as in 1 Pet. iv. 4, 12.</p>
<p><a name="P7852_2552512"></a>
<sup>139 </sup>"He" is properly supplied as frequently in the Gospels. There seems to be a reminiscence of John viii. 24 and similar passages.</p>
<p><a name="P7853_2552886"></a>
<sup>140 </sup>Isa. lxvi. 24; comp. chap. vii. above.</p>
<p><a name="P7854_2553004"></a>
<sup>141 </sup>C reads <font face="SPIonic">u9min</font>, as often, for <font face="SPIonic">h9mi=n</font>, Syriac, accepted by all editors.</p>
<p><a name="P7858_2553773"></a>
<sup>142 </sup><font face="SPIonic">panqamartolo/j</font>; occurring only here; but a similar word, <font face="SPIonic">parqama/rthtoj</font>, occurs in the <i>Teaching</i>, v. 2, <i>Apostolical Constitutions</i>, vii. 18, and <i>Barnabas</i>, xx.</p>
<p><a name="P7859_2554018"></a>
<sup>143 </sup><font face="SPIonic">toi=j o0rga/noij</font>; comp. Ignat., <i>Rom.</i>, iv., <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, i. p. 75, where the word is rendered "instruments," and applied to the teeth of the wild beasts in the amphitheatre. Here Lightfoot renders "engines," regarding the metaphor as military. </p>
<p><a name="P7860_2554384"></a>
<sup>144 </sup>The phrase <font face="SPIonic">ka@n au0th=j</font> implies a doubt of attaining the aim, in accord with the tone of humility which obtains in this chapter.</p>
<p><a name="P7864_2554625"></a>
<sup>145 </sup>Comp. the opening sentence of <i>Barnabas</i>, "Sons and daughters," <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i>, i. p. 137; see also chap. xx.</p>
<p><a name="P7865_2554785"></a>
<sup>146 </sup>If any doubt remained as to the character of this writing, it would be removed by this sentence. The passage is elliptical, <font face="SPIonic">meta\ to\n qeo\n tnj= a0lnqei/aj</font>, but there is no doubt as to the meaning. The Scripture was read, and listening to it was regarded as hearing the voice of God, whose words of truth were read. Then followed the sermon or exhortation; comp. Justin, <i>First Apology</i>, chap. lxvii. (vol. i. p. 186). That lessons from some at least of the New Testament were included at the date of this homily, seems quite certain; comp. the references to the New Testament in chaps. ii., iii., iv., and elsewhere. It is here implied that this homily was written and "read."</p>
<p><a name="P7866_2555495"></a>
<sup>147 </sup>The word <font face="SPIonic">e@nteuzij</font>, here used, means intercession, or supplication, to God (comp. 1 Tim. ii. 1, iv. 5) in early Christian literature: but the classical sense is "entreaty:" so in the opening sentence of Justin, <i>First Apology</i> (vol. i. p. 163, where it is rendered "petition").</p>
<p><a name="P7867_2556056"></a>
<sup>148 </sup>Lightfoot, with Syriac and most editors, reads <font face="SPIonic">skopo/n</font>; but C has <font face="SPIonic">konpon</font>, so Bryennios.</p>
<p><a name="P7868_2556194"></a>
<sup>149 </sup>C had originally <font face="SPIonic">filosofei=n</font> (accepted by Hilgenfeld), but was corrected to <font face="SPIonic">filoponei=n</font>. The latter is confirmed by the Syriac, and now generally accepted, though Hilgenfeld uses the other reading to support his view that Clement of Alexandria was the author.</p>
<p><a name="P7869_2556847"></a>
<sup>150 </sup>Eph. iv. 18.</p>
<p><a name="P7870_2557058"></a>
<sup>151 </sup>C inserts <font face="SPIonic">tou/tw</font>; so Bryennios, Hilgenfeld, and others. Lightfoot omits, with Syriac. The punctuation above given is that of Bryennios and Lightfoot. Hilgenfeld joins this clause with what precedes.</p>
<p><a name="P7874_2557785"></a>
<sup>152 </sup><font face="SPIonic">pei=ran a0qlou=men</font>; the construction is classical, and the figure common in all Greek literature.</p>
<p><a name="P7875_2558390"></a>
<sup>153 </sup>The verbs here are aorists, and have been rendered by the English past tense; the present participle (<font face="SPIonic">mh\ o@n di/kaion</font>) describing the character of the "spirit" must, according to English usage, conform to the main verbs. Lightfoot says, "The aorist here has its common <i>gnomic</i> sense;" and he therefore interprets the passage as a general statement: "Sordid motives bring their own punishment in a judicial blindness." But this gnomic sense of the aorist is not common. C reads <font face="SPIonic">desmo/j</font>, which yields this sense: "and a chain weighed <i>upon him.</i>" Hilgenfeld refers the passage to those Christians who suffered persecution for other causes than those of righteousness. Harnack thinks the author has in mind Satan, as the prince of avarice, and regards him as already loaded with chains. If the aorist is taken in its usual sense, this is the preferable explanation; but the meaning is obscure.</p>
<p><a name="P7877_2559313"></a>
<sup>154 </sup>1 Tim. i. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P7878_2559416"></a>
<sup>155 </sup>Acts iii. 15, v. 31; comp. Heb. ii. 10.</p>
<p><a name="P7879_2559579"></a>
<sup>156 </sup>The doxology is interesting, as indicating the early custom of thus closing a homily. The practice, fitting in itself, naturally followed the examples in the Epistles. </p>
<p><a name="P7897_2559816"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>It was the old Creed of Jerusalem slightly amended, and made the liturgic symbol of Christendom, and the exponent of Catholic orthodoxy. Compare the Creed of Caesarea, Burbidge, p. 334. But see this whole subject admirably illustrated for popular study by Burbidge, <i>Liturgies and Offices of the Church,</i> p. 330, etc., London, Bells, 1885.</p>
