What return, then, shall we make to Him? or what fruit that shall be worthy of that which He has given to us? For,<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7668_2518998" id="P7668_2518998" name="P7668_2518998">6</a></sup> indeed, how great are the benefits<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7669_2519145" id="P7669_2519145" name="P7669_2519145">7</a></sup> which we owe to Him! He has graciously given us light; as a Father, He has called us sons; He has saved us when we were ready to perish.

</ul><p>"Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not; for she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband."<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7681_2520790" id="P7681_2520790" name="P7681_2520790">16</a></sup> In that He said, "Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not," He referred to us, for our Church was barren before that children were given to her. But when He said, "Cry out, thou that travailest not," He means this, that we should sincerely offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail, show signs of weakness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7682_2521178" id="P7682_2521178" name="P7682_2521178">17</a></sup> And in that He said, "For she that is desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband," <i>He means</i> that<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7683_2521495" id="P7683_2521495" name="P7683_2521495">18</a></sup> our people seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through believing, have become more numerous than those who are reckoned to possess God.<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7684_2521710" id="P7684_2521710" name="P7684_2521710">19</a></sup> And another Scripture saith, "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7685_2521861" id="P7685_2521861" name="P7685_2521861">20</a></sup> This means that those who are perishing must be saved. For it is indeed a great and admirable thing to establish, not the things which are standing, but these that are falling. Thus also did Christ desire<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7686_2522199" id="P7686_2522199" name="P7686_2522199">21</a></sup> to save the things which were perishing,<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7687_2522300" id="P7687_2522300" name="P7687_2522300">22</a></sup> and has saved many by coming and calling us when hastening to destruction.<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7688_2522422" id="P7688_2522422" name="P7688_2522422">23</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">Chapter III.-The Duty of Confessing Christ.</font></p>
</ul><p>Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy towards us, and especially in this respect, that we who are living should not offer sacrifices to gods that are dead, or pay them worship, but should attain through Him to the knowledge of the true Father,<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7692_2522769" id="P7692_2522769" name="P7692_2522769">24</a></sup> whereby shall we show that we do indeed know Him,<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7693_2522905" id="P7693_2522905" name="P7693_2522905">25</a></sup> but by not denying Him through whom this knowledge has been attained? For He Himself declares,<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7694_2523225" id="P7694_2523225" name="P7694_2523225">26</a></sup> "Whosoever shall confess Me before men, him will I confess before My Father."<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7695_2523373" id="P7695_2523373" name="P7695_2523373">27</a></sup> This, then, is our reward if we shall confess Him by whom we have been saved. But in what way shall we confess Him? By doing what He says, and not transgressing His commandments, and by honouring Him not with our lips only, but with all our heart and all our mind.<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7696_2523656" id="P7696_2523656" name="P7696_2523656">28</a></sup> For He says<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7697_2523695" id="P7697_2523695" name="P7697_2523695">29</a></sup> in Isaiah, "This people honoureth Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me."<sup><a href="footnote/fn76.htm#P7698_2523813" id="P7698_2523813" name="P7698_2523813">30</a></sup> </p>

</ul><p>Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us.

And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such <i>wicked</i> things, the Lord hath said, "Even though ye were gathered together to Me<sup><a href="footnote/fn77.htm#P7706_2524771" id="P7706_2524771" name="P7706_2524771">35</a></sup> in My very bosom, yet if ye were not to keep My commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from Me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity."<sup><a href="footnote/fn77.htm#P7707_2525019" id="P7707_2525019" name="P7707_2525019">36</a></sup> </p>

</ul><p>As long, therefore, as we are upon earth, let us practise repentance, for we are as clay in the hand of the artificer. For as the potter, if he make a vessel, and it be distorted or broken in his hands, fashions it over again; but if he have before this cast it into the furnace of fire, can no longer find any help for it: so let us also, while we are in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet an opportunity of repentance. For after we have gone out of the world, no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us. Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life.

Let us therefore assist one another that we may also lead up those weak as to what is good,<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7843_2550404" id="P7843_2550404" name="P7843_2550404">130</a></sup> in order that all may be saved; and let us convert and admonish one another.<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7844_2550554" id="P7844_2550554" name="P7844_2550554">131</a></sup> And let us not think to give heed and believe now only, while we are admonished by the presbyters, but also when we have returned home,<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7845_2550778" id="P7845_2550778" name="P7845_2550778">132</a></sup> remembering the commandments<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7846_2551069" id="P7846_2551069" name="P7846_2551069">133</a></sup> of the Lord; and let us not be dragged away by worldly lusts, but coming<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7847_2551236" id="P7847_2551236" name="P7847_2551236">134</a></sup> more frequently let us attempt to make advances in the commandments of the Lord, that all being of of the same mind<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7848_2551543" id="P7848_2551543" name="P7848_2551543">135</a></sup> we may be gathered together unto life.

But the righteous who have done well and endured torments and hated the enjoyments of the soul, when they shall behold those that have gone astray and denied Jesus through their words or through their works, how that they are punished with grievous torments in unquenchable fire, shall be giving glory to God, saying, There will be hope for him that hath served God with his whole heart.</p>

</ul><p>Let us also become of the number of them that give thanks, that have served God, and not of the ungodly that are judged. For I myself also, being an utter sinner,<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7858_2553773" id="P7858_2553773" name="P7858_2553773">142</a></sup> and not yet escaped from temptation, but still being in the midst of the engines<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7859_2554018" id="P7859_2554018" name="P7859_2554018">143</a></sup> of the devil, give diligence to follow after righteousness, that I may have strength to come even near it,<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7860_2554384" id="P7860_2554384" name="P7860_2554384">144</a></sup> fearing the judgment to come.</p>

For as a reward I ask of you that ye repent with the whole heart, thus giving to yourselves salvation and life. For by doing this we shall set a goal<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7867_2556056" id="P7867_2556056" name="P7867_2556056">148</a></sup> for all the young who are minded to labour<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7868_2556194" id="P7868_2556194" name="P7868_2556194">149</a></sup> on behalf of piety and the goodness of God. And let us not, unwise ones that we are, be affronted and sore displeased, whenever some one admonisheth and turneth us from iniquity unto righteousness. For sometimes while we are practising evil things we do not perceive it on account of the double-mindedness and unbelief that is in our breasts, and we are "darkened in our understanding"<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7869_2556847" id="P7869_2556847" name="P7869_2556847">150</a></sup> by our vain lusts. Let us then practise righteousness that we may be saved unto the end. Blessed are they that obey these ordinances. Even if for a little time they suffer evil in the world,<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7870_2557058" id="P7870_2557058" name="P7870_2557058">151</a></sup> they shall enjoy the immortal fruit of the resurrection. Let not then the godly man be grieved, if he be wretched in the times that now are; a blessed time waits for him. He, living again above with the fathers, shall be joyful for an eternity without grief.</p>

No one of the righteous received fruit speedily, but awaiteth it. For if God gave shortly the recompense of the righteous, straightway we would be exercising ourselves in business, not in godliness; for we would seem to be righteous, while pursuing not what is godly but what is gainful. And on this account Divine judgment surprised a spirit that was not righteous, and loaded it with chains.<sup><a href="footnote/fn78.htm#P7875_2558390" id="P7875_2558390" name="P7875_2558390">153</a></sup> </p>
