<font size="3">Who They Were that Ventured to Make Schisms, and Did Not Escape Punishment.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>I.</b> Above all things, O bishop, avoid the sad and dangerous and most atheistical heresies, eschewing them as fire that burns those that come near to it. Avoid also schisms: for it is neither lawful to turn one's mind towards wicked heresies, nor to separate from those of the same sentiment out of ambition. For some who ventured to set up such practices of old did not escape punishment. For Dathan and Abiram,<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6332_2204670" id="P6332_2204670" name="P6332_2204670">1</a></sup> who set up in opposition to Moses, were swallowed up into the earth. But Corah, and those two hundred and fifty who with him raised a sedition against Aaron, were consumed by fire. Miriam also, who reproached Moses, was cast out of the camp for seven days; for she said that Moses had taken an Ethiopian to wife.<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6333_2204996" id="P6333_2204996" name="P6333_2204996">2</a></sup> Nay, in the case of Azariah and Uzziah,<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6334_2205052" id="P6334_2205052" name="P6334_2205052">3</a></sup> the latter of which was king of Judah, but venturing to usurp the priesthood, and desiring to offer incense, which it was not lawful for him to do, was hindered by Azariah the high priest, and the fourscore priests; and when he would not obey he found the leprosy to arise in his forehead, and he hastened to go out, because the Lord had reproved him.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P6336_2205421"></a>
<font size="3">That It is Not Lawful to Rise Up Either Against the Kingly or the Priestly Office.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>II.</b> Let us therefore, beloved, consider what sort of glory that of the seditious is, and what their condemnation. For if he that rises up against kings is worthy of punishment, even though he be a son or a friend, how much more he that rises up against the priests! For by how much the priesthood is more noble than the royal power, as having its concern about the soul, so much has he a greater punishment who ventures to oppose the priesthood, than he who ventures to oppose the royal power, although neither of them goes unpunished. For neither did Absalom nor Abdadan<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6338_2206075" id="P6338_2206075" name="P6338_2206075">4</a></sup> escape without punishment; nor Corah and Dathan.<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6339_2206145" id="P6339_2206145" name="P6339_2206145">5</a></sup> The former rose against David, and strove concerning the kingdom; the latter against Moses, concerning pre-eminence. And they both spake evil; Absalom of his father David, as of an unjust judge, saying to every one: "Thy words are good, but there is no one that will hear thee, and do thee justice. Who will make me a ruler? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6340_2206485" id="P6340_2206485" name="P6340_2206485">6</a></sup> But Abdadan: "I have no part in David, nor any inheritance in the son of Jesse."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6341_2206583" id="P6341_2206583" name="P6341_2206583">7</a></sup> It is plain that he could not endure to be under David's government, of whom God spake: "I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who will do all my commands."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6342_2206778" id="P6342_2206778" name="P6342_2206778">8</a></sup> But Dathan and Abiram, and the followers of Corah, said to Moses: "Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us out of the land of Egypt, out of a land flowing with milk and honey? And why hast thou put out our eyes? And wilt thou rule over us? "And they gathered together against him a great congregation; and the followers of Corah said: "Has God spoken alone to Moses? Why is it that He has given the high-priesthood to Aaron alone? Is not all the congregation of the Lord holy? And why is Aaron alone possessed of the priesthood? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6343_2207333" id="P6343_2207333" name="P6343_2207333">9</a></sup> And before this, one said: "Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?

</ul><p><b>IV.</b> If therefore God inflicted punishment immediately on those that made a schism on account of their ambition, how much rather will He do it upon those who are the leaders of impious heresies! Will not He inflict severer punishment on those that blaspheme His providence or His creation? But do you, brethren, who are instructed out of the Scripture, take care not to make divisions in opinion, nor divisions in unity. For those who set up unlawful opinions are marks of perdition to the people. In like manner, do not you of the laity come near to such as advance doctrines contrary to the mind of God; nor be you partakers of their impiety. For says God: "Separate yourselves from (he midst of these men, lest you perish together with them."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6367_2211013" id="P6367_2211013" name="P6367_2211013">25</a></sup> And again: "Depart from the midst of them, and separate yourselves, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6368_2211173" id="P6368_2211173" name="P6368_2211173">26</a></sup> </p>

<font size="3">Upon What Account Israel, Falsely So Named, is Rejected by God, Demonstrated from the Prophetic Predictions.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>V.</b> For those are most certainly to be avoided who blaspheme God. The greatest part of the ungodly, indeed, are ignorant of God; but these men, as fighters against God, are possessed with a wilful evil disposition, as with a disease. For from the wickedness of these heretics "pollution is gone out upon all the earth,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6372_2211620" id="P6372_2211620" name="P6372_2211620">27</a></sup> as says the prophet Jeremiah. For the wicked synagogue is now cast off by the Lord God, and His house is rejected by Him, as He somewhere speaks: "I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine inheritance."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6373_2211847" id="P6373_2211847" name="P6373_2211847">28</a></sup> And again, says Isaiah: "I will neglect my vineyard, and it shall not be pruned nor digged, and thorns shall spring up upon it, as upon a desert; and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6374_2212074" id="P6374_2212074" name="P6374_2212074">29</a></sup> He has therefore "left His people as a tent in a vineyard, and as a garner in a fig or olive yard, and as a besieged city."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6375_2212214" id="P6375_2212214" name="P6375_2212214">30</a></sup> He has taken away from them the Holy Spirit, and the prophetic rain, and has replenished His Church with spiritual grace, as the "river of Egypt in the time of first-fruits; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6376_2212406" id="P6376_2212406" name="P6376_2212406">31</a></sup> and has advanced the same "as an house upon an hill, or as an high mountain; as a mountain fruitful for milk and fatness, wherein it has pleased God to dwell. For the Lord will inhabit therein to the end."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6377_2212639" id="P6377_2212639" name="P6377_2212639">32</a></sup> And He says in Jeremiah: "Our sanctuary is an exalted throne of glory."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6378_2212732" id="P6378_2212732" name="P6378_2212732">33</a></sup> And He says in Isaiah: "And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and the house of the Lord shall be upon the top of the mountains, and shall be advanced above the hills."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6379_2212976" id="P6379_2212976" name="P6379_2212976">34</a></sup> Since, therefore, He has forsaken His people, He has also left His temple desolate, and rent the veil of the temple, and took from them the Holy Spirit; for says He, "Behold, your house is left unto you desolate."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6380_2213207" id="P6380_2213207" name="P6380_2213207">35</a></sup> And He has bestowed upon you, the converted of the Gentiles, spiritual grace, as He says by Joel: "And it shall come to pass after these things, saith God, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons shall prophesy, and your daughters shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6381_2213541" id="P6381_2213541" name="P6381_2213541">36</a></sup> For God has taken away all the power and efficacy of His word, and such like visitations, from that people, and has transferred it to you, the converted of the Gentiles. For on this account the devil himself is very angry at the holy Church of God: he is removed to you, and has raised against you adversities, seditions, and reproaches, schisms, and heresies. For he had before subdued that people to himself, by their slaying of Christ.

</ul><p><b>VI.</b> For even the Jewish nation had wicked heresies: for of them were the Sadducees, who do not confess the resurrection of the dead; and the Pharisees, who ascribe the practice of sinners to fortune and fate; and the Basmotheans, who deny providence, and say that the world is made by spontaneous motion, and take away the immortality of the soul; and the Hemerobaptists, who every day, unless they wash, do not eat,-nay, and unless they cleanse their beds and tables, or platters and cups and seats, do not make use of any of them; and those who arc newly risen amongst us, the Ebionites, who will have the Son of God to be a mere man, begotten by human pleasure, and the conjunction of Joseph and Mary. There are also those that separate themselves from all these, and observe the laws of their fathers, and these are the Essenes. These, therefore, arose among the former people. And now the evil one, who is wise to do mischief, and as for goodness, knows no such good thing, has cast out some from among us, and has wrought by them heresies and schisms.</p>

But when Simon saw that the Spirit was given to believers by the imposition of our hands, he took money, and offered it to us, saying, "Give me also the power, that on whomsoever I also shall lay my hand, he may receive the Holy Ghost; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6396_2217431" id="P6396_2217431" name="P6396_2217431">45</a></sup> being desirous that as the devil<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6397_2217484" id="P6397_2217484" name="P6397_2217484">46</a></sup> deprived Adam by his tasting of the tree of that immortality which was promised him, so also that Simon might entice us by the receiving of money, and might thereby cut us off from the gift of God,<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6398_2217741" id="P6398_2217741" name="P6398_2217741">47</a></sup> that so by exchange we might sell to him for money the inestimable gift of the Spirit. But as we were all troubled at this offer, I Peter, with a fixed attention on that malicious serpent which was in him, said to Simon: "Let thy money go with thee to perdition, because thou hast thought to purchase the gift of God with money. Thou hast no part in this matter, nor lot in this faith; for thy heart is not fight in the sight of God.

</ul><p><b>VIII.</b> But when we went forth among the Gentiles to preach the word of life, then the devil wrought in the people to send after us false apostles to the corrupting of the word; arid they sent forth one Cleobius, and joined him with Simon, and these became disciples to one Dositheus, whom they despising, put him down from the principality. Afterwards also others were the authors of absurd doctrines: Cerinthus, and Marcus, and Menander, and Basilides, and Saturnilus. Of these some own the doctrine of many gods, some only of three, but contrary to each other, without beginning, and ever with one another, and some of an infinite number of them, and those unknown ones also. And some reject marriage; and their doctrine is, that it is not the appointment of God; and others abhor some kinds of food: some are impudent in uncleanness, such as those who are falsely called Nicolaitans. And Simon meeting me Peter, first at Caesarea Stratonis (where the faithful Cornelius, a Gentile, believed on the Lord Jesus by me), endeavoured to pervert the word of God; there being with me the holy children, Zacchaeus, who was once a publican, and Barnabas; and Nicetas and Aquila, brethren of Clement the bishop and citizen of Rome, who was the disciple of Paul, our fellow-apostle and fellow-helper in the Gospel. I thrice discoursed before them with him concerning the true Prophet, and concerning the monarchy of God; and when I had overcome him by the power of the Lord, and had put him to silence, I drove him away into Italy.</p>

</ul><p><b>IX.</b> Now when he was in Rome, he mightily disturbed the Church, and subverted many, and brought them over to himself, and astonished the Gentiles with his skill in magic, insomuch that once, in the middle of the day, he went into their theatre, and commanded the people that they should bring me also by force into the theatre, and promised he would fly in the air; and when all the people were in suspense at this, I prayed by myself. And indeed he was carried up into the air by demons, and did fly on high in the air, saying that he was returning into heaven, and that he would supply them with good things from thence. And the people making acclamations to him, as to a god, I stretched out my hands to heaven, with my mind, and besought God through the Lord Jesus to throw down this pestilent fellow, and to destroy the power of those demons that made use of the same for the seduction and perdition of men, to dash him against the ground, and bruise him, but not to kill him. And then, fixing my eyes on Simon, I said to him: "If I be a man of God, and a real apostle of Jesus Christ, and a teacher of piety, and not of deceit, as thou art, Simon, I command the wicked powers of the apostate from piety, by whom Simon the magician is carried, to let go their hold, that he may fall down headlong from his height, that he may be exposed to the laughter of those that have been seduced by him." When I had said these words, Simon was deprived of his powers, and fell down headlong with a great noise, and was violently dashed against the ground, and had his hip and ankle-bones broken; and the people cried out, saying, "There is one only God, whom Peter rightly preaches in truth." And many left him; but some who were worthy of perdition continued in his wicked doctrine. And after this manner the most atheistical heresy of the Simonians was first established in Rome; and the devil wrought by the rest of the false apostles<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6407_2222342" id="P6407_2222342" name="P6407_2222342">50</a></sup> also.</p>

Some of them say that there are many gods, some that there are three gods without beginning, some that there are two unbegotten gods, some that there are innumerable Aeons. Further, some of them teach that men are not to marry, and must abstain from flesh and wine, affirming that marriage, and the begetting of children, and the eating of certain foods, are abominable; that so, as sober persons, they may make their wicked opinions to be received as worthy of belief. And some of them absolutely prohibit the eating of flesh, as being the flesh not of brute animals, but of creatures that have a rational soul, as though those that ventured to slay them would be charged with the crime of murder. But others of them affirm that we must only abstain from swine's flesh, but may eat such as are clean by the law; and that we ought to be circumcised, according to the law, and to believe in Jesus as in an holy man and a prophet. But others teach that men ought to be impudent in uncleanness, and to abuse the flesh, and to go through all unholy practices, as if this were the only way for the soul to avoid the rulers of this world.

We deliberated, together with James the Lord's brother, what was to be done; and it seemed good to him and to the elders to speak to the people words of doctrine.

And they, when they were come to Jerusalem, declared to us what questions were arisen in the church of Antioch,-namely, that some said men ought to be circumcised, and to observe the other purifications. And when some said one thing, and some another, I Peter stood up, and said unto them: "Men and brethren, ye know how that from ancient days God made choice among you that the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel by my mouth, and believe; and God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6426_2228384" id="P6426_2228384" name="P6426_2228384">58</a></sup> For an angel of the Lord appeared on a certain time to Cornelius,<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6427_2228471" id="P6427_2228471" name="P6427_2228471">59</a></sup> who was a centurion of the Roman government, and spake to him concerning me, that he should send for me, and hear the word, of life from my mouth. He therefore sent for me from Joppa to Caesarea Stratonis; and when I was ready to go to him, I would have eaten. And while they made ready I was in the upper room praying; and I saw heaven opened, and a vessel, knit at the four corners like a splendid sheet, let down to the earth, wherein were all manner of four-looted beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the heaven. And there came a voice out of heaven to me, saying, Arise, Peter; kill, and eat. And I said, By no means, Lord: for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And there came a voice a second time, saying, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common. And this was done thrice, and the vessel was received up again into heaven. But as I doubted what this vision should mean, the Spirit said to me, Behold, men seek thee; but rise up, and go thy way with them, nothing doubting, for I have sent them.<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6428_2229528" id="P6428_2229528" name="P6428_2229528">60</a></sup> These men were those which came from the centurion, and so by reasoning I understood the word of the Lord which is written: `Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6429_2229737" id="P6429_2229737" name="P6429_2229737">61</a></sup> And again: `All the ends of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all the families of the heathen shall worship before Him: for the kingdom is in the Lord's, and He is the governor of the nations.'<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6430_2229969" id="P6430_2229969" name="P6430_2229969">62</a></sup> And observing that there were expressions everywhere concerning the calling of the Gentiles, I rose up, and went with them, and entered into the man's house. And while I was preaching the word, the Holy 'Spirit fell upon him, and upon those that were with him, as it did upon us at the beginning; and He put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. And I perceived that God is no respecter of persons; but that in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, will be accepted with Him. But even the believers which were of the circumcision were astonished at this. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to lay an heavy yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear?

The same things even now have the wicked heretics done, reproaching the creation, marriage, providence, the begetting of children, the law, and the prophets; inscribing certain barbarous names, and, as they think, of angels, but, to speak the truth, of demons, which suggest things to them: whose doctrine eschew, that ye may not be partakers of the punishment due to those that write such things for the seduction and perdition of the faithful and unblameable disciples of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<font size="3">Of Some Jewish and Gentile Observances.</font></p>
</ul><p><b>XXVII.</b> Now if any persons keep to the Jewish customs and observances concerning the natural emission and nocturnal pollutions, and the lawful conjugal acts,<sup><a href="footnote/fn65.htm#P6575_2265451" id="P6575_2265451" name="P6575_2265451">157</a></sup> let them tell us whether in those hours or days, when they undergo any such thing, they observe not to pray, or to touch a Bible, or to partake of the Eucharist? And if they own it to be so, it is plain they are void of the Holy Spirit, which always continues with the faithful. For concerning holy persons Solomon says: "That every one may prepare himself, that so when he sleeps it may keep him, and when he arises it may talk with him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn65.htm#P6576_2265907" id="P6576_2265907" name="P6576_2265907">158</a></sup> For if thou thinkest, O woman, when thou art seven days in thy separation, that thou art void of the Holy Spirit, then if thou shouldest die suddenly thou wilt depart void of the Spirit, and without assured hope in God; or else thou must imagine that the Spirit always is inseparable from thee, as not being in a place. But thou standest in need of prayer and the Eucharist, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, as having been guilty of no fault in this matter. For neither lawful mixture, nor child-bearing, nor the menstrual purgation, nor nocturnal pollution, can defile the nature of a man, or separate the Holy Spirit from him. Nothing but impiety and unlawful practice can do that. For the Holy Spirit always abides with those that are possessed of it, so long as they are worthy; and those from whom it is departed, it leaves them desolate, and exposed to the wicked spirit. Now every man is filled either with the holy or with the unclean spirit; and it is not possible to avoid the one or the other, unless they can receive opposite spirits. For the Comforter hates every lie, and the devil hates all truth. But every one that is baptized agreeably to the truth is separated from the diabolical spirit, and is under the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit remains with him so long as he is doing good, and fills him with wisdom and understanding, and suffers not the wicked spirit to approach him, but watches over his goings. Thou therefore, O woman, if, as thou sayest, in the days of thy separation thou art void of the Holy Spirit, thou art then filled with the unclean one; for by neglecting to pray and to read thou wilt invite him to thee, though he were unwilling. For this spirit, of all others, loves the ungrateful, the slothful, the careless, and the drowsy, since he himself by ingratitude was distempered with evil mind, and was thereby deprived by God his dignity; having rather chosen to be a devil than an archangel. Wherefore, O woman, eschew such vain words, and be ever mindful of God that created thee, and pray to Him. For He is thy Lord, and the Lord of the universe; and meditate in His laws without observing any such things, such as the natural purgation, lawful mixture, child-birth, a miscarriage, or a blemish of the body; since such observations are the vain inventions of foolish men, and such inventions as have no sense in them. Neither the burial of a man, nor a dead man's bone, nor a sepulchre, nor any particular sort of food, nor the nocturnal pollution, can defile the soul of man; but only impiety towards God, and transgression, and injustice towards one's neighbour; I mean rapine, violence, or if there be anything contrary to His righteousness, adultery or fornication. Wherefore, beloved, avoid and eschew such observations, for they are heathenish. For we do not abominate a dead man, as do they, seeing we hope that he will live again. Nor do we hate lawful mixture; for it is their practice to act impiously in such instances. For the conjunction of man and wife, if it be with righteousness, is agreeable to the mind of God. "For He that made them at the beginning made them male and female; and He blessed them, and said, Increase and multiply, and fill the earth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn65.htm#P6577_2269147" id="P6577_2269147" name="P6577_2269147">159</a></sup> If, therefore, the difference of sexes was made by the will of God for the generation of multitudes, then must the conjunction of male and female be also acceptable to His mind.</p>

</ul><p><b>XXVIII.</b> But we do not say so of that mixture that is contrary to nature, or of any unlawful practice; for such are enmity to God. For the sin of Sodom is contrary to nature, as is also that with brute beasts. But adultery and fornication are against the law; the one whereof is impiety, the other injustice, and, in a word, no other than a great sin. But neither sort of them is without its punishment in its own proper nature. For the practisers of one sort attempt the dissolution of the world, and endeavour to make the natural course of things to change for one that is unnatural; but those of the second son-the adulterers-are unjust by corrupting others' marriages, and dividing into two what God hath made one, rendering the children suspected, and exposing the true husband to the snares of others. And fornication is the destruction of one's own flesh, not being made use of for the procreation of children, but entirely for the sake of pleasure, which is a mark of incontinency, and not a sign of virtue.

For "precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6605_2275669" id="P6605_2275669" name="P6605_2275669">176</a></sup> And again: "O my soul, return unto thy rest, for the Lord hath done thee good."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6606_2275770" id="P6606_2275770" name="P6606_2275770">177</a></sup> And elsewhere: "The memory of the just is with encomiums."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6607_2275849" id="P6607_2275849" name="P6607_2275849">178</a></sup> And, "The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6608_2275927" id="P6608_2275927" name="P6608_2275927">179</a></sup> For those that have believed in God, although they are asleep, are not dead. For our Saviour says to the Sadducees: "But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which is written, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God, therefore, is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6609_2276304" id="P6609_2276304" name="P6609_2276304">180</a></sup> Wherefore, of those that live with God, even their very relics are not without honour. For even Elisha the prophet, after he was fallen asleep, raised up a dead man who was slain by the pirates of Syria.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6610_2276540" id="P6610_2276540" name="P6610_2276540">181</a></sup> For his body touched the bones of Elisha, and he arose and revived. Now this would not have happened unless the body of Elisha were holy. And chaste Joseph embraced Jacob after he was dead upon his bed;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6611_2276768" id="P6611_2276768" name="P6611_2276768">182</a></sup> and Moses and Joshua the son of Nun carried away the relics of Joseph,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6612_2276857" id="P6612_2276857" name="P6612_2276857">183</a></sup> and did not esteem it a defilement. Whence you also, O bishops, and the rest, who without such observances touch the departed, ought not to think yourselves defiled. Nor abhor the relics of such persons, but avoid such observances, for they are foolish. And adorn yourselves with holiness and chastity, that ye may become partakers of immortality, and partners of the kingdom of God, and may receive the promise of God, and may rest for ever, through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p>To Him, therefore, who is able to open the ears of your hearts to the receiving the oracles of God administered to you both by the Gospel and by the teaching of Jesus Christ of Nazareth; who was crucified under Pontius Pilate and Herod, and died, and rose again from the dead, and will come again at the end of the world with power and great glory, and will raise the dead, and put an end to this world, and distribute to every one according to his deserts: to Him that has given us Himself for an earnest of the resurrection; who was taken up into the heavens by the power of His God and Father in our sight, who ate and drank with Him for forty days after He arose from the dead; who is sat down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty of Almighty God upon the cherubim; to whom it was said, "Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6614_2278243" id="P6614_2278243" name="P6614_2278243">184</a></sup> whom the most blessed Stephen saw standing at the right hand of power, and cried out, and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6615_2278447" id="P6615_2278447" name="P6615_2278447">185</a></sup> as the High Priest of all the rational orders,-through Him, worship, and majesty, and glory be given to Almighty God, both now and for evermore.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6616_2278613" id="P6616_2278613" name="P6616_2278613">186</a></sup> Amen. </p>
