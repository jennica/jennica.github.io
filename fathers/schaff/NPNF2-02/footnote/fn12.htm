<sup>102 </sup>For a full account of Antinoüs and his relations to Hadrian, see Smith, <i>Dict. of Greek and Raman Biogr. and Mythol.</i>, article Antinoüs. The story has been put into literary fiction in the historical novels <i>Antinoüs</i>, by George Taylor (A. Hausrath), and <i>The Emperor,</i> by Georg Ebers.</p>

<sup>103 </sup>It is uncertain what the true reading should be here. In one of the mss. it is <font face="SPIonic">'Adriaj</font><font>, in another </font><font face="SPIonic">'Andriaj</font><font>; according to others </font><font face="SPIonic">'Adrianoj</font><font>, or </font><font face="SPIonic">'Arrianoj</font><font>. Valesius suggests the substitution of </font><font face="SPIonic">Loukianoj</font><font>. If this be adopted, then the Alexander suggested is Lucian's Alexander of Abonoteichus. For a lucid and suggestive reproduction of this story, see Froude, <i>Short Studies on Great Subjects,</i> essay on <i>Lucian.</i></font></p>

<sup>104 </sup>The mss. and all the Greek texts read <font face="SPIonic">Zhnwn</font><font>, making the name `Pasinicus Zenon, or Zeno.0' The translation here given assumes the alteration in the process of transcription of a single letter making the original </font><font face="SPIonic">Zhlwn</font><font>, which probably means the city of Zeleia, on the southeastern coast of the Euxine, famous for a victory of Mithridates over Triarius, the lieutenant of Lucullus, in 67 b.c. </font></p>
<p><a name="P1221_541377"></a>
<sup>105 </sup>This word, whose original is <font face="SPIonic">Cenon</font><font>, is inserted by Valesius. If it were omitted, the translation would be, `which to some seems <i>acceptable.</i>0'</font></p>

<sup>8 </sup>Ammianus Marcellinus, <i>Rerum Gestarum,</i> XXVI. ix. 8-10, says that Florentius and Barchalba, after the fight at Nacolia, delivered Procopius bound to Valens, and that Procopius was immediately beheaded, and Florentius and Barchalba soon underwent the same punishment. Philostorgius also (IX.) relates that Procopius was beheaded, and that Florentius, who delivered him to Valens, was burnt. </p>

<sup>11 </sup>Sozom. VI. 8, gives the same account; but Philostorgius (V. 3) and Theodoret (<i>H. E.</i> II. 37 and 39) say that Eunomius was made bishop of Cyzicus under the Emperor Constantius immediately after the Synod of Seleucia. He was banished by Valens because he favored the usurper Procopius.</p>
<p><a name="P1277_558976"></a>
<sup>12 </sup><font face="SPIonic">sxolaioj</font><font>, defined by Sophocles (<i>Greek Lexicon of the Rom. and Byzantine Periods</i>) as suspended. It appears, however, that among the civil and military officers in the Roman system there were some who bore the title without being concerned in the management of their offices, and that these were termed <i>vacantes</i> and therefore that Socrates is using the Greek equivalent of a Latin term and applying it in ecclesiastical matters as its original was applied in civil and military affairs. Cf., on the position of bishops without churches Bingham, <i>Christ. Antiq.</i> IV. ii. 14. This system of clerics without charges was abused so much that the Council of Chalcedon (Canon 6) forbade further ordination <i>sine titulo.</i></font></p>

<sup>13 </sup>See chap. 3, and on the Eunomians with their subsequent fortunes, V. 24. </p>

<sup>14 </sup>Ammianus Marcellinus (<i>Rerum Gestarum</i> XXVI. viii. 2 <i>seq.</i>) says, `From the walls of Chalcedon they uttered reproaches to him and insultingly reviled him as Sabaiarius. For, sabaia is a poor drink made of wheat or barley in Illyricum (whence Valens came).0' On the Pannonian or Illyrian origin of Valens, see IV. I. It appears also that the Pannonians were accustomed to live on poor diet in general.</p>
<p><a name="P1284_561600"></a>
<sup>15 </sup>Sozom. VIII. 21, mentions these baths. Am. Marcellinus (<i>Rerum. Gestarum,</i> XXXI. I. 4) relates that Valens built a bath out of the stones of the walls of Chalcedon. So also Themist. <i>Orat. Decen. ad Valentem,</i> and Gregory Nazianzen, <i>Orat.</i> 25; the latter calls it a `subterraneous and aerial river.0' Zonaras and Cedrenus, however, affirm that the structure built was not a bath, but an aque duct. Cf. Cedrenus, I. 543 (P. 310, B).</p>

<sup>19 </sup>Am. Marcellinus (<i>Rerum Gestarum,</i> XXVI. 4. 14), in speaking of Procopius, the usurper, says: `Procopius ...resorted to the Anastasian baths, named from the sister of Constantine0'; from which it appears that either (1) there were two baths of the same name, or (2) the baths here alluded to were named after Constantine's sister and renamed on the occasion of their being repaired or altered, or (3) that Socrates is in error. From the improbabilities connected with (I) and (2) we may infer that (3) is the right view. </p>
