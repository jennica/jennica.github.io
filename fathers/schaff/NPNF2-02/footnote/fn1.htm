<sup>1 </sup>Eusebius seems to have adopted this name as a token of friendship and respect for Pamphilus, bishop of Caesarea. See McGiffert, <i>Prolegomena</i> in Vol. I., Second Series of Post-Nicene Fathers.</p>
<p><a name="P179_39880"></a>
<sup>2 </sup>Eusebius' <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> ends with the death of Licinius in 323. His <i>Life of Constantine</i> is in a sense a continuation of the History, and yet as it is very well characterized by Socrates, it is a eulogy and therefore its style and selection of facts are affected by its purpose, rendering it too inadequate as a continuation of the <i>Ecclesiastical History;</i> hence Socrates' constraint to review some of the events which naturally fall in Eusebius' period.</p>
<p><a name="P184_41440"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>`Socrates is here in error; for Maximianus Herculius, who was otherwise called Maximian the Elder, was, by Constantine's command, slain in Gallia in 310 a.d. But Maximius Caesar, two years after, being conquered by Licinius, died at Tarsus.0' (Valesius.) On the confusion of Maximian and Maximin, see Introd. III.</p>
<p><a name="P185_42218"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>305 or 306 a.d.</p>
<p><a name="P186_42849"></a>
<sup>5 </sup><font face="SPIonic">panta periepwn</font><font>, not to be taken literally, inasmuch as there were two other Augusti-Constantine and Maxentius; and hence though senior Augustus, he was not sole ruler. On the appointment of the Augusti under Diocletian, and meaning of the title, see Gibbon, <i>Decline and Fall,</i> chap. xiii. </font></p>
<p><a name="P187_44491"></a>
<sup>6 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'En tontw nika</font><font>. For an extensive and satisfactory treatment of this famous passage in the life of Constantine, see Richardson, <i>Proleffornena to the Life of Const.,</i> Vol. I., Second Series, Post-Nicene Fathers.</font></p>
<p><a name="P188_45623"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>312 a.d.</p>
<p><a name="P189_46324"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>Cf. an account of these events in Sozomen, I. 3. See also on the persecution instituted by Diocletian Neander, <i>Hist. of the Christ. Ch.</i> Vol. I. pp. 143-156 Schaff, <i>Hist. of the Christ. Ch.</i> Vol. I. pp. 174-177; Euseb. <i>H. E.,</i> Books VIII.-X. Lactantius, <i>de Mortibus persec.</i> c. 7 seq. Diocletian abdicated in 305 a.d.</p>
<p><a name="P194_46983"></a>
<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'Ellhnwn</font><font>: the word is used without the sense of nationality. So also in the New Testament often: Mark vii. 26; Gal. ii. 3 and Gal iii. 28, where the Syriac (Peschitto) version renders, more according to sense than according to the letter, `an Aramaean.0' </font></p>
<p><a name="P199_49648"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>After a victory the soldiers greeted their prince with acclamations of `Emperor!0' `Augustus!0' So also did the citizens on his triumphal entry into the city. So it appears Constantine was formally greeted on assuming the sole control of affairs.</p>
