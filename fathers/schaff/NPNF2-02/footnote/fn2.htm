<sup>11 </sup>Though Sabellius was the originator of one of the earliest and most plausible attempts at explanation of the mystery of the Trinity (for which see life of Sabellius in Smith and Wace, <i>Dict. of Christian Biog.</i>, and Hodge, <i>System. Theol.</i> Vol. I. p. 452, 459), nothing is known of him, not even why he is called a Libyan here (also by other ancient writers, e.g. Philastrius, <i>de Haeres.</i> 26, and Asterius, quoted by Phot. <i>Biblioth. Cod.</i> 27). Some say that he was a native and resident of Libya, others that he was an ecclesiastic appointed to some position there; nor is it known whether the Libya meant is the Libyan Pentapolis or the Pentapolitan Ptolemais.</p>

<sup>12 </sup><font face="SPIonic">npostasi/</font><font>.

Cf. below III. 7. Later it was applied to the `special or characteristic nature of a thing,0' and so became the very opposite of </font><font face="SPIonic">onsia</font><font> (the general nature); hence equivalent to <i>person.</i></font></p>

<sup>34 </sup>Valesius makes the assertion that Socrates is mistaken here, that the Melitians joined themselves to the Arians after the council of Nicaea, and were induced by Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, to cast slanderous aspersion upon Athanasius, as he himself testifies in his second apology against the Arians. It appears unlikely that the Fathers of the Nicene Council would have treated the Melitians as leniently as they did had they sided with Arius before the council.</p>

<sup>44 </sup>Socrates' lack of theological training can be inferred from his admiration for this rather superficial letter of Constantine's; so also the rudimentary character of Constantine's views of Gospel truth and his want of appreciation for the vital nature of the question in the Arian controversy. It may be noted, however, that the statesmanship shown in the tone and recommendations of the letter is just as farsighted as the theology of it is superficial. Constantine had sought to unite the empire through the church, and now that very church threatened to disrupt the empire; and this, at the very time, when by his final victory over Licinius and the foundation of his new capital, he seemed to have realized the ideal of a reunited empire. </p>

<sup>45 </sup>Cf. the parallel account in Sozom. I. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P262_77759"></a>
<sup>46 </sup>In a single sentence this controversy was as to whether the Easter should be observed on a fixed day in every year or on the 14th of the lunar month Nisan of the Jews, on whatever day of the week that might happen to fall. For a fuller discussion of the controversy, see Smith's <i>Dict. of the Bible,</i> and the literature there referred to.</p>

<sup>49 </sup>Hosius mentioned before in chap. 7.</p>
<p><a name="P267_79759"></a>
<sup>50 </sup>According to Valesius, who follows Musculus, the prelate here meant was the bishop of Rome. The reason alleged is that at the time of the meeting of the council, Constantinople had not yet been made the `imperial city.0' But considering the general indifference of Socrates to the affairs of the Western Church, and the fact that when he wrote, the imperial city was actually Constantinople, it is very probable that it is the bishop of that city he means to name here, and not the bishop of Rome.</p>

<sup>52 </sup>The exact number is variously given as 250 by Eusebius (<i>Life of Const.</i> III. 8); 270 by Eustathius; 318 by Evagrius (<i>H. E.</i> III. 31); Athanasius (<i>Ep.</i> to the African bishops); Hilarius (<i>Contra Constantium</i>); Jerome (<i>Chronicon</i>), and Rufinus.</p>

<sup>59 </sup>Macedonian = follower of Macedonius, not a native resident of Macedonia. Sabinus was the author of a collection of the acts of the Synod used by Socrates quite freely (cf. I. 9; II. 15, 17 <i>et al.</i>). Socrates, however, criticises for prejudice against the orthodox. Sabinus was bishop of the church of the Macedonians in Heraclea, a city in Thrace. </p>

<sup>60 </sup>This is according to the reading of Valesius Hussey, and Bright. The reading, `<i>our</i> Lord,0' &amp;c., of the English translations in Bagster and Bohn's series is probably a typographical error, though strangely perpetuated down to the reprint of 1888.</p>

<sup>62 </sup>This creed is found twelve times in eleven ancient sources, two versions being given in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon. The second version of the Council of Chalcedon contains certain additions from the creed of Constantinople; all the rest substantially agree. Cf. Schaff, <i>Creeds of Christendom,</i> Vol. I. p. 24, and Vol. II. p. 50, 91; Walch, <i>Antiquitates Symbolicae</i> (1772), p. 87 seq.; Hahn, <i>Bibliothek der Symbole,</i> p. 40-107, and other literature referred to in Schaff's <i>Creeds,</i> &amp;c.</p>
