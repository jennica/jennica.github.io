<sup>151 </sup>From this place it plainly appears, as Valesius remarks, that the authority of the see of Constantinople was acknowledged, even before the council of Constantinople. throughout the region of the Hellespont and Bithvnia, which conclusion is also confirmed by the acts of Eudoxius, bishop of Constantinople, who made Eunomius bishop of Cyzicus. Two causes co-operated to secure this authority, viz. (1) the official establishment of the city as the capital of the empire by Constantine, and (2) the transference to it of Eusebius of Nicomedia, a most vigorous and aggressive bishop, who missed no opportunity for enlarging and consolidating the power of his see.</p>

<sup>154 </sup>According to Valesius it appears incredible that the Catholics should have done what Socrates says they did. `For there is nothing more contrary to ecclesiastical discipline than to communicate with heretics either in the sacraments or in prayer.0' Hence `Socrates was probably imposed upon by the aged Auxano, who fixed upon all the Catholics what was perhaps done by some few Christians who were less cautious.0' But Socrates' own attitude towards the Novatians (cf. Introd. p. x.) shows that the difference between them and the Catholics (<font face="SPIonic">oi thj ekklhsiaj</font><font>) was not universally regarded as an absolute schism forbidding communication even during such times of trial as these described here, which might certainly have drawn together parties already as near to one another as the Novatians and Catholics.</font></p>

<sup>157 </sup>In this calamity Cecropius, the bishop of Nicomedia, perished, and the splendid cathedral of the city was ruined; both of which misfortunes were attributed by the heathen to the wrath of their gods. See Sozom. IV. 16.</p>

<sup>162 </sup>Athanas. (<i>de Synodd. 29</i>) gives the following portion of this creed apparently as the only declaration made by the council.</p>

<sup>164 </sup>See Chrysostom, <i>Homilies</i> 9 and 27, <i>on Acts,</i> and <i>Hom.</i> 1, on <i>2 Tim.</i>, for the belief of the ancient Church in the descent of the Holy Spirit on the ordained in and through ordination.</p>
<p><a name="P934_414346"></a>
<sup>165 </sup>He was the only one, inasmuch as the General Synod of Constantinople (381 a.d.) expressly forbade all appeals from the ecclesiastical to the civil courts, attaching severe penalties to the violation of its canon on this subject. Cf. Canon 6 of Council of Constantinople. Hefele, <i>Hist. of the Ch. Councils,</i> Vol. II. p. 364. </p>
<p><a name="P939_417001"></a>
<sup>166 </sup>On the distinction between the prefect and proconsul and the different functions of each, see Smith, <i>Diction. of Greek and Roman Ant.</i> The statement of Socrates here that Constantius first put Constantinople under a prefect is borne out by Athanasius' mention of Donatus as proconsul of Europe, with Constantinople as chief city.</p>
<p><a name="P940_417827"></a>
<sup>167 </sup>The General Synod of Chalcedon, 451 a.d., in its seventh canon forbade, under pain of anathema, the mixing of the clerical office with political and worldly matters.</p>
<p><a name="P941_418108"></a>
<sup>168 </sup>The <font face="SPIonic">taceij</font><font> here mentioned were classes of officials appointed under a sort of military law, to serve for a given length of time as agents of the presidents and governors of provinces. Cf. Justin. <i>Cod.</i> 12, <i>tit.</i> 52-59.</font></p>

<sup>180 </sup>1 Tim. iv. 3. Cf. Euseb. <i>H. E.</i> IV. 29, on the earliest forms of expression against marriage in the Christian Church; also <i>Apost. Canon,</i> LI. and Augustine, <i>Haerr.</i> XXV., XL., XLVI. See Bingham, <i>Eccl. Antiq.</i> XXII. 1.</p>

<sup>181 </sup>On Synod of Gangra, see Hefele, <i>Hist. of the Ch. Councils,</i> Vol. II. p. 325-339. Almost all the canons of the synod seem to be addressed against the teachings of Eustathius. The fourth canon is expressly on the celibacy of the clergy, as follows: `If any one maintains that, when a married priest offer the sacrifice, no one should take part in the service, let him be anathema.0' </p>
<p><a name="P965_427966"></a>
<sup>182 </sup>This was evidently the second consecration of the earlier church of St. Sophia (cf. I. 16, II. 6); the first consecration was celebrated in 326 a.d. Later, the structure was destroyed in a fire, in connection with a popular uprising; and the great church of St. Sophia, at present a Mohammedan mosque, was erected by Justinian, with Isidore of Miletus and Anthimius of Trailes as architects.</p>

<sup>185 </sup><font face="SPIonic">parashmoj</font><font>; just as a counterfeit coin has the appearance of the genuine, and is meant to deceive those who do not investigate its genuineness, so the term `homoioousios0' (</font><font face="SPIonic">omoioousioj</font><font>), the author implies, was meant to deceive the popular ear by its likeness to the genuine `<i>homoousios.</i>0'</font></p>
