<sup>140 </sup>See above, ch. 17.</p>
<p><a name="P507_207498"></a>
<sup>141 </sup>Arius, the originator of the Arian heresy, died before the council at Jerusalem; hence Valesius infers that this Arius must be another man of the same name mentioned in the encyclical of Alexander of Alexandria as a partisan of the arch-heretic. Cf. ch. 6.</p>
<p><a name="P508_208022"></a>
<sup>142 </sup>This letter is contained in Athanasius' <i>de Synod,</i> 21, and a portion of it in <i>Apol. contra Arian, 84.</i> </p>

<sup>145 </sup>In the persecution under Decius (249 a.d.), those who yielded so far as to perform the heathen rites were branded with the title of `the lapsed0'; and a controversy arose later on the manner in which they should be treated. One of the consequences of lapsing was disqualification for high office in the church. See Neander, <i>Hist. of Christ. Ch.</i> Vol. I. p. 226 seq.</p>
<p><a name="P525_216301"></a>
<sup>146 </sup>Paul of Samosata, who has been surnamed in modern times the Socinus of the third century, was deposed in 269 a.d. by a council held at Antioch for unchristian character and unsound views. His peculiarity in the latter respect was his denial of the divinity of Jesus Christ. For fuller information, see Eus. <i>H. E.</i> VII. 30; Epiphan. <i>Haer.</i> LXVII.; Neander, <i>Hist. of the Christ. Ch.</i> Vol. I, 602 seq.; Gieselee, <i>Hist. of the Ch.</i> Vol. I. 201; Smith and Wace <i>Dict. of Christ.

<sup>149 </sup>It was the belief of many in the earlier ages of the church that baptism had a certain magical power purging away the sins previous to it, but having no force as regards those that might follow; this led many to postpone their baptism until disease or age warned them of the nearness of death; such delayed baptism was called `clinic baptism,0' and was discouraged by the more judicious and spiritual-minded Fathers, some of whom doubted its validity and rebuked those who delayed as actuated by selfishness and desire to indulge in sin. The church, however, encouraged it in the cases of gross offenders. Cf. Bingham, <i>Eccl. Antiq.</i> IV. 3, and XI. 11, and Bennett, <i>Christian Archaeology,</i> pp. 407 and 409.</p>
<p><a name="P541_225674"></a>
<sup>150 </sup>Cf. Euseb. <i>Life of Const.</i> IV. 63, and Rufinus, <i>H. E.</i> I. 11. The story is, however, doubtful, as Valesius observes. It is more likely that some one of the lay officials of the government, or, as Philostorgius says, Eusebius of Nicomedia, was entrusted with this will, and not a mere presbyter. That it was probably Eusebius of Nicomedia becomes the more probable when we consider that that bishop also probably baptized Constantine.</p>
<p><a name="P546_227481"></a>
<sup>151 </sup>337 a.d. The 22d of May that year was the day of Pentecost. </p>
<p><a name="P555_227772"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>Rufinus' <i>Historia Ecclesiastica,</i> in two books, begins with Arius and ends with Theodosius the Great. It is not very accurate, but written largely from memory. It is dedicated to Chromatius, bishop of Aquileja, and translated into Greek by Gelasius and Cyril of Jerusalem. On the edition used by Socrates, see Introd. and I. 12, note 1. Cf. also on his knowledge of Latin, II. 23, 30, and 37.</p>
<p><a name="P556_229800"></a>
<sup>2 </sup><font face="SPIonic">w iere tou Qeou anqrwpe Qeodwre</font><font>; cf. Introd. p. x, also VI. Introd. and VII. 48. </font></p>
<p><a name="P561_233449"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>There is some difference of opinion as to the exact year of the recall of Athanasius. Baronius and others allege that this took place in 338 a.d., the year after the death of Constantine; but Valesius maintains that Athanasius was recalled the year preceding. This he infers from the words of Athanasius (<i>Apol. c. Arian,</i> 61), and the title of the letter which Constantine the younger addressed to the church in Alexandria.</p>
<p><a name="P576_236852"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>340 a.d. </p>
<p><a name="P581_237260"></a>
<sup>5 </sup>Socrates is undoubtedly mistaken in setting the date of Alexander's death as late as 340 a.d. The council convened to examine and confute the charges against Athanasius met in 339 a.d., and the record at that date has it (see chap. 7) that Eusebius had taken possession of the see of Constantinople. Alexander must therefore have died before 339.</p>
<p><a name="P582_238935"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>So called, not because there was a saint or eminent person of that name, but on the same principle as the church called Sophia. For the history of the latter church, see Dehio and Bezold, <i>Die Kirchliche Baukuns des Abendlandes,</i> I. p. 21.</p>
<p><a name="P591_240720"></a>
<sup>7 </sup>So called in distinction from the "New Rome," or Constantinople. Cf. <i>Canons of Council of Chalcedon,</i> XXVIII.</p>
<p><a name="P592_240902"></a>
<sup>8 </sup>The word `canon0' here is evidently used in its general sense. There is no record of any enactment requiring the consent of the bishop of Rome to the decisions of the councils before they could be considered valid. There may have been a general understanding to that effect, having the force of an unwritten law. In any case the use of the word by Socrates is quite singular, unless we assume that he supposed there was such an enactment somewhere, as is implied by its use ordinarily.</p>
<p><a name="P593_241607"></a>
<sup>9 </sup>341 a.d. </p>
<p><a name="P598_242900"></a>
<sup>10 </sup>Sozom. <i>H. E.</i> III. 6. From the passage in Sozomen it appears that it was customary in Edessa to teach the Scriptures to boys, and that many of them thus became quite familiar with the Bible, knowing many passages by heart.</p>
<p><a name="P599_244215"></a>
<sup>11 </sup><font face="SPIonic">maqhmatikhn</font><font>. From its use in astronomy the science of mathematics soon came to be identified with that counterfeit of astronomy,-astrology. It is so used by Sextus Empiricus (616. 20; 728. 20) and by Iamblichus, <i>Myrt.</i> 277. 2.</font></p>
