Vol. I. p. 629-702, containing conclusive proof of this, as well as a history of the question); whence it appears that it was under Antoninus Pius that he died. Valesius therefore infers that Socrates meant to speak of Irenaeus as suffering martyrdom under Gordian, and not of Polycarp. If this be the case, we must assume a serious corruption of the text, or an unparalleled confusion in Socrates. </p>

<sup>108 </sup>Baronius (<i>Ann.</i> 57 and 391 a.d.) finds two mistakes here: first, in the assertion that the Romans fasted three weeks only before Easter, and second, in the assertion that during those three weeks Saturdays were excepted. Cf. also Ceillier, <i>Hist. des Auteurs Sacrés et Ecclesiast.</i> Vol. VIII. p. 523, 524. Valesius, however, quotes Pope Leo (fourth sermon on the Lent Fast) and Venerable Beda to prove that Socrates' assertion concerning the exception of Saturday may be defended. See Quesnell, <i>de Fejunio Sabbati;</i> Bingham, <i>Origin. Eccl.</i> XXI. I. 14; also Beveridge, <i>de Fejunio Quadragesimali.</i></p>
<p><a name="P1716_738876"></a>

<p><a name="P1718_739840"></a>
<sup>111 </sup>Valesius rightly conjectures that very few observed this mode of fasting during Lent, basing his opinion on the order of worship and various deprecatory expressions in ancient authors with respect to it. It may be noted that the Mohammedan Fast of Ramadan is observed on the same principle and in a similar manner. The fast begins with the dawn of the sun and continues until sunset, being complete for that space of time. With the setting of the sun, however, every person is at liberty to eat as he may please. </p>

<sup>112 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ounacewn</font><font>. Sophocles (<i>Greek Lex. of the Rom. and Byzant.

Baronii,</i> No. 42) 5. `The celebration of the Eucharist.0' It is in the second sense given by Sophocles that it is used here.</font></p>

<sup>113 </sup>i.e. Saturday. Sunday is never called `the Sabbath0' by the ancient Fathers and historians, but `the Lord's day0' (<font face="SPIonic">kuriakh</font><font>). Sophocles (<i>Greek Lex. of the Rom. and Byzant. Period</i>) gives three senses to the word; viz., 1. `The Sabbath0' [of the Jews] (so in the LXX and Jewish writers). 2. `The week.0' 3. `Saturday.0' Many early Christians, however, continued to observe the Jewish Sabbath along with the first day of the week.

The Heliodorus who wrote the <i>Ethiopica</i> was, according to Photius, <i>Biblioth.</i> chap. 94, a native of Phoenicia, hence not the same as the bishop of Tricca. Others ascribe the <i>Ethiopica</i> to Heliodorus the Sophist, who flourished under the Emperor Hadrian.</p>

<sup>120 </sup>According to the <i>Apost. Constit.</i> (II. 57) a church should be built so as to face the east. This regulation was generally followed, but there were exceptions. Cf. Bingham, <i>Christ. Antiq.</i> VIII. 3. 2.</p>

<sup>122 </sup><i>Apost. Can.</i> 64, provides that no cleric or layman shall fast on the Sabbath day (Saturday, see note 22, above), the former on pain of being deposed, the latter, of being excommunicated. It appears, however, that the Roman church observed the day as a fast, while the Greek church held it to be a feast. Socrates, however, seems to contradict the statement he had made above (see note 17) that at Rome Saturdays and Sundays were excepted from the list of fasting days in Lent. From Augustine's <i>Epistles,</i> 36. 31 <i>et al.</i>, it appears that he fasted on Saturday and regarded this the regular and proper course to be pursued, and actually pursued by members of the church. Hence the present statement of Socrates must be taken as correct to the exclusion of the former.</p>

<sup>124 </sup>Acts xv. 23-39. The quotation is here from the Authorized Version. The Revised has it slightly altered. We subjoin it for comparison. `The apostles and the elder brethren unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting: Forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment; it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth. For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.0'</p>

<sup>132 </sup><i>Apost.

<sup>140 </sup>There is some doubt as to the length of Theodosius' life; most of the ancient historians (Sozomen, Theophanes, Cedrenus) agree with Socrates in giving it as sixty years. Am.

<sup>6 </sup>Zosimus (V. 5) says Rufinus invited Alaric and the Goths to invade the Roman territories; Valesius reconciles Socrates' and Zosimus' statements by assuming that they are partial and supplementary to one another; Rufinus, according to him, invited both the Huns and the Goths.</p>
