<sup>154 </sup>A most amazing mixture of metaphors. This sentence furnishes an excellent illustration of Eusebius' rhetorical style.</p>

<sup>155 </sup>The origin of the Church at Rome is shrouded in mystery. Eusebius gives the tradition which rules in the Catholic Church, viz.: that Christianity was introduced into Rome by Peter, who went there during the reign of Claudius. But this tradition is sufficiently disproved by history. The origin of the Church was due to unknown persons, though it is possible we may obtain a hint of them in the Andronicus and Junta of Romans xvi. 7, who are mentioned as apostles, and who were therefore, according to the usage of the word in Paul's writings, persons that introduced Christianity into a new place-missionaries proper, who did not work on others' ground.</p>

<sup>157 </sup>John Mark, son of Mary (Acts xii. 12), a sister of Barnabas (Col. iv. 10), was a companion of Paul and Barnabas in their missionary journeys, and afterward a companion of Barnabas alone (Acts xv. 39), and still later was with Paul again in Rome (Col. iv. 10 and Philemon 24), and with Peter when he wrote his first epistle (1 Pet. v. 13). For the later traditions concerning Mark, see the next chapter, note 1.</p>
<p><a name="P1207_566782"></a>
<sup>158 </sup>That Mark wrote the second Gospel under the influence of Peter, or as a record of what he had heard from him, is the universal tradition of antiquity. Papias, in the famous and much-disputed passage (quoted by Eusebius, III. 39, below), is the first to record the tradition. Justin Martyr refers to Mark's Gospel under the name "Memoirs (<font face="SPIonic">apomnhoneumata</font><font>) of Peter" (<i>Dial. c. Tryph.</i> 106; the translation in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Am. Ed. Vol. I. p. 252, which refers the </font><font face="SPIonic">autou</font><font> to Christ, is incorrect; compare Weiss, <i>N. T. Einleitung,</i> p. 44, note 4). Irenaeus (<i>Adv. Haer.</i> III. 11. 1, quoted below, V. 8. 2), Tertullian (<i>Adv. Marcionem,</i> IV. 5), and Origen (quoted below, VI. 25) confirm the tradition, which is repeated over and over again by the Fathers.</font></p>
<p>The question as to the real authorship of our second Gospel, or rather as to its composition and its relation to Matthew and Luke, is a very difficult one. The relationship of the three synoptical Gospels was first discussed by Augustine (<i>De Consensu Evangelistarum</i>), who defended the traditional order, but made Mark dependent upon Matthew. This view prevailed until the beginning of the present century, when the problem was attacked anew, and since then it has been the crux of the literary criticism of the Bible. The three have been held to be dependent upon each other, and every possible order has found its advocates; a common source has been assumed for the three: the Hebrew Matthew, the <i>Gospel according to the Hebrews</i> (see Bk. III. chap. 25, note 24), our canonical Gospel of Mark, or an original Mark, resembling the present one; a number of fragmentary documents have been assumed; while others, finally, have admitted only oral tradition as the basis. According to Baur's tendency theory, Matthew (polemically Jewish-Christian) came first, followed by an original Luke (polemically Pauline-Christian), then by our Mark, which was based upon both and written in the interest of neutrality, and lastly by our present Luke, designed as a final irenicum. This view now finds few advocates. The whole matter is still unsettled, but criticism seems to be gradually converging toward a common ground type (or rather two independent types) for all three while at the same time maintaining the relative independence of the three, one toward the other. What these ground types were, is a matter of still sharper dispute, although criticism is gradually drawing their larger features with more and more certainty and clearness. (The latest discussion upon the subject by Handmann, <i>das Hebräer-Evangelium,</i> makes the two types the "Ur-Marcus" and the Gospel of the Hebrews.) That in the last analysis, however, some space must still be left for floating tradition, or for documents irreducible to the one or two types, seems absolutely certain. For further information as to the state of discussion upon this intricate problem, see among recent works, especially Weiss, <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 473 sqq., Holtzmann, <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 328 sqq., and Schaff, <i>Ch.</i> Hist. I. 575 sqq., where the literature down to 1882 is given with great fullness. Conservative opinion puts the composition of all the synoptic Gospels before the destruction of Jerusalem (for the date of Luke, see III. 4, note 12); but the critical school, while throwing the original type back of that date, considers the composition of our present Gospels to have been the gradual work of years, assuming that they were not finally crystallized into the form in which we have them before the second century.</p>

<sup>159 </sup>This mention of the "pleasure" of Peter, and the "authority" given by him to the work of Mark, contradicts the account of Clement to which Eusebius here appeals as his authority. In Bk. VI. chap. 14 he quotes from the <i>Hypotyposes</i> of Clement, a passage which must be identical with the one referred to in this place, for it is from the same work and the general account is the same; but there Clement says expressly, "which when Peter understood he neither directly hindered nor encouraged it."</p>

<sup>160 </sup>The passage from Papias is quoted below in Bk. III. chap. 39. Papias is a witness to the general fact that Mark wrote down what he had heard from Peter, but not (so far as he is extant) to the details of the account as given by Eusebius. Upon Papias himself, see Bk. III. chap. 39.</p>

<sup>161 </sup>1 Pet. v. 13. Commentators are divided as to the place in which Peter wrote this epistle (compare <i>Schaff's Church Hist.</i> I. p. 744 sqq.). The interpretation given by Eusebius is the patristic and Roman Catholic opinion, and is maintained by many Protestant commentators. But on the other hand the literal use of the word "Babylon" is defended by a great number of the leading scholars of the present day. Compare Weiss, <i>N. T. Einleitung,</i> p. 433, note 1.</p>
<p><a name="P1215_572484"></a>
<sup>162 </sup>That Mark labored in Egypt is stated also by Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> LI. 6), by Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 8), by Nicephorus (<i>H. E.</i> II. 43), and by the <i>Acta Barnabae,</i> p. 26 (Tischendorf's <i>Acta Apost. Apocr.</i> p. 74), which were written probably in the third century. Eusebius gained his knowledge apparently from oral tradition, for he uses the formula, "they say" (<font face="SPIonic">fasin</font><font>.). In chap. 24, below, he says that Annianus succeeded Mark as a leader of the Alexandrian Church in the eighth year of Nero (62 a.d.), thus implying that Mark died in that year; and Jerome gives the same date for his death. But if the tradition that he wrote his Gospel in Rome under Peter (or after Peter's death, as the best tradition puts it, so e.g. Irenaeus) be correct, then this date is hopelessly wrong. The varying traditions are at best very uncertain, and the whole career of Mark, so far as it is not recorded in the New Testament, is involved in obscurity.</font></p>

<sup>164 </sup>This tradition that Philo met Peter in Rome and formed an acquaintance with him is repeated by Jerome (<i>de vir ill.</i> 11), and by Photius (<i>Cod.</i> 105), who even goes further, and says directly that Philo became a Christian. The tradition, however, must be regarded as quite worthless. It is absolutely certain from Philo's own works, and from the otherwise numerous traditions of antiquity that he never was a Christian, and aside from the report of Eusebius (for Jerome and Photius do not represent an independent tradition) there exists no hint of such a meeting between Peter and Philo; and when we realize that Philo was already an old man in the time of Caius (see above, chap. 4, note 8), and that Peter certainly did not reach Rome before the later years of Nero's reign, we may say that such a meeting as Eusebius records (only upon tradition, <font face="SPIonic">logoj exel</font><font>) is certainly not historical. Where Eusebius got the tradition we do not know. It may have been manufactured in the interest of the Philonic authorship of the <i>De vita contemplativa,</i> or it may have been a natural outgrowth of the ascription of that work to him, some such explanation suggesting itself to the reader of that work as necessary to explain Philo's supposed praise of Christian monks. Philo's visit to Rome during the reign of Caligula being a well-known historic fact, and Peter's visit to Rome during the reign of Claudius being assumed as likewise historic (see above, chap. 14, note 8), it was not difficult to suppose a meeting between them (the great Christian apostle and the great Jewish philosopher), and to invent for the purpose a second visit of Philo to Rome. It seems probable that the ascription of the work <i>De vita contemplativa</i> to Philo came before the tradition of his acquaintance with Peter in Rome (which is first mentioned by Eusebius); but in any case the two were mutually corroborative.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1224_576453"></a>
<sup>165 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri biou qewrhtikou h iketwn</font><font>; <i>De Vita Contemplativa.</i> This work is still extant, and is given by Mangey, II. 471-486. Eusebius is the first writer to mention it, and he identifies the Therapeutae described in it with the Christian monks, and assumes in consequence that monasticism in the form in which he knew it existed in the apostolic age, and was known and praised by Philo. This opinion was generally adopted by the Fathers (with the single exception of Photius, <i>Cod.</i> 105, who looked upon the Therapeutae as a Jewish sect) and prevailed unquestioned until the Reformation, when in the Protestant reaction against monasticism it was denied that monks existed in the apostolic age, and that the Therapeutae were Christians at all. Various opinions as to their identity have been held since that time, the commonest being that they were a Jewish sect or school, parallel with the Palestinian Essenes, or that they were an outgrowth of Alexandrian Neo-Pythagoreanism. The former opinion may be said to have been the prevailing one among Christian scholars until Lucius, in his work entitled <i>Die Therapeuten und ihre Stellung in der Gesch. der Askese</i> (Strassburg, 1879), proved (what had been asserted already by Graetz and Jost) that the Therapeutae are really to be identified with Christian monks, and that the work <i>De Vita Contemplativa</i> is not a genuine work of Philo's. If the former proposition is proved, the latter follows of necessity, for it is absolutely impossible to suppose that monasticism can have existed in so developed a form (or indeed in any form) in the time of Philo. On the other hand it may be proved that the work is not Philonic, and yet it may not follow that the Therapeutae are to be identified with Christian monks. And so some scholars reject the Philonic authorship while still maintaining the Jewish character of the Therapeutae (e.g. Nicolas, Kuenen, and Weingarten; see Schürer, <i>Gesch. der Fuden im Zeitalter Fesu Christi,</i> p. 863). In the opinion of the writer, who agrees therein with the great majority of scholars, Lucius has conclusively demonstrated both his propositions, and has shown that the work <i>De Vita Contemplativa</i> is the production of some Christian of the latter part of the third century, who aimed to produce an apology for and a panegyric of monasticism as it existed in his day, and thus to secure for it wider recognition and acceptance. Lucius concludes with the following words: "Wir haben es demnach in D.V.C. mit einer Tendenzschrift zu thun, welche, da sie eine welt ausgebildete und in zahlreichen Ländern verbreitete Askese, so wie Zustäde voraussetzt, genau wie dieselben nur im Christenthum des dritten Jahrhunderts vorhanden waren, kaum anders aufgefasst werden kann, als eine, etwa am Ende des dritten Jahrhunderts, unter dem Namen Philo's, zu Gunsten der Christlichen Askese, verfasste Apologie, als erstes Glied eines an derartigen Producte _beraus reichen Litteratur-zweige der alten Kirche." Compare with Lucius' work the reviews of it by Hilgenfeld in the <i>Zeitschrift für wiss. Theol.,</i> 1880, pp. 423-440, and by Schürer in the <i>Theologische Literaturzeitung,</i> 1880, No. 5. The latter especially has added some important considerations with reference to the reasons for the composition of this work under the name of Philo. Assuming then the correctness of Lucius' conclusions, we see that Eusebius was quite right in identifying the Therapeutae with the Christian monks as he knew them in his day, but that he was quite wrong in accepting the Philonic authorship of the work in question, and in concluding that the institution of monasticism as he knew it existed already in the apostolic age (compare note 19, below).</font></p>
<p><a name="P1225_580297"></a>
<sup>166 </sup>It may fairly be doubted whether the work does not really contain considerable that is not in strict accordance with the facts observed by the author, whether his account is not to an extent idealized, and whether, in his endeavor to emphasize the Jewish character of the Therapeutae, with the design of establishing the antiquity of monasticism (compare the review of Schürer referred to above), he has not allowed himself to introduce some imaginative elements. The strong asseveration which he makes of the truthfulness of his account would rather increase than allay this suspicion, and the account itself at certain points seems to bear it out. On the whole, however, it may be regarded as a reasonably accurate sketch. Were it not such, Eusebius would not have accepted it, so unreservedly as he does, as an account of Christian monks. Lucius' exhibition of the points of similarity between the practices of the Therapeutae, as described here, and of early Christian monks, as known from other sources, is very interesting (see p. 158 sq.).</p>

<sup>183 </sup>How Eusebius, who knew that Philo lived wrote during the reign of Claudius, could have overlooked the fact that Christianity had not at that time been long enough established to admit of virgins growing old within the Church, is almost inexplicable. It is but another example of his carelessness in regard to chronology which comes out so often in his history. Compare Stroth's words: "In der That ein wichtiger Beweis, der gerade der irrigen Meinung des Eusebius am meisten entgegen ist. Denn sie hätten alt zum Christenthum kommen m_ssen, sonst konnten sie ja zu Philo's Zeiten unmöglich im Christenthum alt geworden sein, dessen Schrift Eusebius selbst indie Regierung des Claudius setzt. Es ist beinahe unbegreiflich, wie ein so guter Kopf, wie Eusebius ist, in so grobe Irrthümer fallen konnte." </p>

The work forms the second great group of writings upon the Pentateuch, and is a very full and allegorical commentary upon Genesis, beginning with the second chapter and following it verse by verse through the fourth chapter; but from that point on certain passages are selected and treated at length under special titles, and under those titles, in Schürer's opinion, were publisher by Philo as separate works, though really forming a part of one complete whole. From this much confusion has resulted. Eusebius embraces all of the works as far as the end of chap. 4 (including five titles in Mangey) under the one general title, but from that point on he too quotes separate works under special titles but at the end (§5, below) he unites them all as the "extant works on Genesis."

So far as Eusebius seems to have known, they covered only Genesis and Exodus, and this is all that we are sure of, though some think that they included also the remainder of the Pentateuch. About half of his work (four books on Genesis and two on Exodus) is extant in an Armenian version (published by Aucher in 2 vols., Venet. 1822 and '26, and in Latin by Ritter, vols. 6 and 7 of his edition of Philo's works); and numerous Latin and Greek fragments still exist (see Sch_rer, p. 837 sqq.).</font></p>

<sup>197 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri te tou, tiz o twn qeiwn esti klhronomoz, h peri thz eiz taisa kai enantia tomhz</font><font>. From this double title Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 11) wrongly makes two works. The writing is still extant, and is given by Mangey (I. 473-518) under the title </font><font face="SPIonic">peri tou tiz o twn qeiwn pragmatwn klhponomoz</font><font> (Schürer, 844).</font></p>

<sup>198 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri twn triwn aretwn az sun allaiz anegraye Mwushz</font><font>. This work is still extant, and is given by Mangey under the title </font><font face="SPIonic">peri triwn aretwn htoi peri andreiaz kai filanqrwpiaz kai metanoiaz: peri andreiaz</font><font>, II. 375-383; </font><font face="SPIonic">peri filanqrwpiaz</font><font>, II. 383-405; </font><font face="SPIonic">peri metanoiaz</font><font>, II. 405-407. Jerome gives the simple title <i>De tribus virtutibus liber unus.</i></font></p>
<p>According to Schürer (p. 852 sqq.) it forms an appendix to the third great group of works upon the Pentateuch, containing those laws which do not belong to any one of the ten commandments in particular, but fall under the head of general cardinal virtues. The third group, as Sch_rer describes it (p. 846), aims to give for non-Jews a complete view of the Mosaic legislation, and embraces, first, the work upon the Creation (which in the mss. and editions of Philo is wrongly placed at the beginning in connection with the great <i>Allegorical Commentary,</i> and is thus included in that by Eusebius in his list of Philo's works, so that he does not make special mention of it); second, the lives of great and good men, the <i>living unwritten law;</i> and third, the Mosaic legislation proper (1. The ten commandments; 2. The special laws connected with each of these); and finally an appendix treating of certain cardinal virtues, and of reward and punishments. This group is more historic and less allegoric than the two others, which are rather esoteric and scientific.</p>

<sup>199 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri twn metonomazomenwn kai wn eneka metonomazontai</font><font>, <i>De Mutatione nominum.</i> Upon Gen. xvii. 1-22. This work is still extant, and is given by Mangey, I. 578-619. See Schürer, p. 485.</font></p>

<sup>200 </sup><font face="SPIonic">en w fhsi suntetaxenai kai peri diaqhkwn prwton kai deuteron</font><font>. Nearly all the mss., followed by some of the editors, read </font><font face="SPIonic">prwthz kai deuteraj</font><font>, instead of </font><font face="SPIonic">prwton kai deuteron</font><font>, thus making Eusebius mention a work "On the first and second covenants," instead of a first and second book "On the covenants." It is plain from Philo's own reference to the work (on p. 586 in Mangey's ed.) that he wrote two books "On covenants," and not a work "On the two covenants." I have therefore felt warranted in reading with Heinichen and some other editors </font><font face="SPIonic">prwton kai deuteron</font><font>, a reading which is more natural in view of the absence of an article with </font><font face="SPIonic">diaqhkwn</font><font>, and which is confirmed by Nicephorus Callistus. This reading must be correct unless we are to suppose that Eusebius misread Philo. Fabricius suggests that Eusebius probably wrote </font><font face="SPIonic">a kai b</font><font>, which the copyists wrongly referred to the "covenants" instead of to the number of the books, and hence gave the feminine instead of the neuter form.</font></p>
<p>This work "On covenants," or "On the whole discussion concerning covenants" (as Philo gives it), is now lost, as it was already in the time of Eusebius; at least he knew of it only from Philo's reference to it. See Schürer, p. 845.</p>

<sup>201 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri apoikiaz</font><font>: <i>De Migratione Abrahami.</i> Upon Gen. xii. 1-6. The work is still extant, and is given by Mangey, I. 436-472. See Schürer, p. 844.</font></p>

<sup>202 </sup><font face="SPIonic">biou safou tou kata dikaiosunhn teleiwqentoj, h nomwn agrafwn</font><font>. (According to Schürer, </font><font face="SPIonic">dikaiosunhn</font><font> here is a mistake for </font><font face="SPIonic">didaskalian</font><font>, which is the true reading in the original title.) This work, which is still extant, is given by Mangey, II. 1-40, under the same title (</font><font face="SPIonic">didaskalian</font><font>, however, instead of </font><font face="SPIonic">dikaiosunhn</font><font>), with the addition, </font><font face="SPIonic">o esti peri 'Abraam</font><font>: <i>De Abrahamo.</i> It opens the second division of the third great group of writings on the Pentateuch (see note 11, above): the biographical division, mentioning Enos, Enoch and Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but dealing chiefly with Abraham. The biographies of Isaac and Jacob probably followed, but they are lost, and we have no trace of them, so that the life of Joseph (see below, note 26) in the mss. follows directly upon that of Abraham (Schürer, p. 848 sqq.).</font></p>

<sup>203 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri gigantwn, h peri tou mh trepesqai to qeion</font><font>. Upon Gen. vi. 1-4 and Gen. vi. 4-12. The two parts of this work, both of which are still extant, form really but one book; for instance, Johannes Mona-chus (<i>ineditus</i>) quotes from the latter part under the title </font><font face="SPIonic">peri gigantwn</font><font> (according to Mangey, I. 262, note, and 272, note). But the two are divided in Mangey's edition, where the first is given under the title </font><font face="SPIonic">peri gigantwn</font><font> (I. 262-272), the second under the title </font><font face="SPIonic">oti atrepton</font><font> (I. 272-299). See Schürer, p. 843. The title is found in the form given at the beginning of this note in all the mss. of Eusebius except two, which have </font><font face="SPIonic">kai</font><font> instead of </font><font face="SPIonic">h</font><font>, thus making two separate works. This reading is adopted by Heinichen and by Closs, but is poorly supported by ms. authority, and since the two titles cover only one work, as already mentioned, the </font><font face="SPIonic">h</font><font> is more natural than the </font><font face="SPIonic">kai</font><font>.</font></p>

<sup>204 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri te tou kata Mwusea qeopemptouj einai touj oneirouj prwton, deuteron, k.t.l</font><font>. Two books are extant, the first upon Gen. xxviii. 12 sqq. and Gen. xxxi. 11 sqq. (given by Mangey, I. 620-658), the second upon Gen. xxxvii. and xl.-xli. (given by Mangey, I. 659-699). Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> II) follows Eusebius in mentioning five books, and there is no occasion to doubt the report. Schürer thinks that the two extant books are the second and third of the original five (Schürer, 845 sqq.).</font></p>
<p><a name="P1293_605569"></a>
<sup>205 </sup><font face="SPIonic">zhthmata kai luseij</font><font>; see above, note 3. Eusebius knew only five books upon Exodus, and there is no reason to think there were any more.</font></p>

<sup>206 </sup>Philo wrote a work entitled <font face="SPIonic">peri biou Mwsewj</font><font>: <i>Vita Mosis,</i> which is still extant, but is not mentioned in the catalogue of Eusebius. It contains a long description of the tabernacle, and consequently Schürer concludes that the work mentioned here by Eusebius (</font><font face="SPIonic">peri thj skhnhj</font><font>) represents that portion of the larger work. If this be the case, it is possible that the section in the mss. used by Eusebius was detached from the rest of the work and constituted an independent book. The omission of the title of the larger work is doubtless due, as Schürer remarks, to the imperfect transmission of the text of Eusebius' catalogue. See Schürer, p. 855.</font></p>

<sup>207 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri twn deka logiwn</font><font>: <i>De Decalogo.</i> Still extant, and given by Mangey, II. 180-209. Jerome has the condensed title <i>de tabernaculo et decalogo libri quattuor,</i> and this introduces the third division of the third general group of works upon the Pentateuch (see note II, above), and, according to Schürer, should be joined directly to the </font><font face="SPIonic">bioj politikoj</font><font>, or <i>Life of Joseph,</i> and not separated from it by the insertion of the <i>Life of Moses</i> (as is done by Mangey), which does not belong to this group (Schürer, p. 849 sqq.).</font></p>

<sup>208 </sup><font face="SPIonic">ta peri twn anaferomenwn en eidei nomwn eij ta sunteinonta kefalaia twn deka logwn, abgd</font><font>: <i>De specialibus legibus.</i> A part of the third division of the third general group of works (see note II, above). It is still extant in four books, each with a special title, and each containing many subdivisions. They are given by Mangey: first book, II. 210-269, in seven parts: <i>de circumcisione, de monarchia Liber I., de monarchia Liber II., de praemiis sacerdotum, de victimis, de sacrificantibus,</i> or <i>de victimis offerentibus, de mercede meretricis non accipienda in sacrarium;</i> second book, 270-298, incomplete in Mangey, but entire in Tischendorf's <i>Philonea,</i> p. 1-83; third book, 299-334; fourth book, 335-374: made up like the first of a number of tracts on special subjects. Philo, in this work, attempts to bring all the Mosaic laws into a system under the ten rubrics of the decalogue: for instance, under the first two commandments, the laws in regard to priests and sacrifices; under the fourth, the laws in regard to the Sabbath, &amp;c. See Schürer, p. 850 sqq.</font></p>

<sup>209 </sup><font face="SPIonic">peri twn eij taj ierourgiaj zwwn, kai tina ta twn qusiwn eioh</font><font>. This is really only a portion of the first book of the work just mentioned, given in Mangey under the title <i>de victimis</i> (II. 237-250). It is possible that these various sections of books-or at least this one-circulated separately, and that thus Eusebius took it for an independent work. See Schürer, p. 851.</font></p>

The writing forms a sort of epilogue to the work upon the Mosaic legislation. Schürer, p. 854.</font></p>
