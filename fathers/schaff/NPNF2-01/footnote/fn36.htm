<sup>49 </sup>Septimius Severus died on February 4, 211, after a reign of a little more than seventeen years and eight months, and was succeeded by his two sons, Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Bassianus (commonly known by his nickname Caracalla, which, however, was never used in official documents or inscriptions), and Lucius, or Publius, Septimius Geta. Eusebius mentions here only the former, giving him his official name, Antoninus.</p>

<sup>50 </sup>Eusebius makes a slip here, as this is the first time he has mentioned Alexander in his <i>Church History.</i> He was very likely under the impression that he had mentioned him just above, where he referred to the bishops of Caesarea and Jerusalem. He does refer to him in his <i>Chron.,</i> putting his appointment as assistant bishop into the second year of Caracalla (<i>Armen.</i> fourth year), and calling him the thirty-fifth bishop of Jerusalem (<i>Armen.</i> thirty-sixth). In Bk. V. chap. 12 of the <i>History</i> (also in the <i>Chron.</i>) we are told that Narcissus was the thirtieth bishop of Jerusalem. The number thirty-five for Alexander (the number thirty-six of the <i>Armen.</i> is a mistake, and is set right in connection with Alexander's successor, who is also called the thirty-sixth) is made out by counting the three bishops mentioned in chap. 10, and then reckoning the second episcopate of Narcissus (see the same chapter) as the thirty-fourth. We learn from chap. 14 that Alexander was an early friend of Origen's, and a fellow-pupil in the school of Clement. We know him next as bishop of some church in Cappadocia (chap. 11; see note 2 on that chapter), whence he was called to be assistant bishop of Jerusalem (see the same chapter). From this passage, compared with chap. 11, we learn that Alexander was imprisoned during the persecutions, and the <i>Chron.</i> gives the year of his "confession" as 203 a.d. But from chap. 11 we learn that he wrote while still in prison to the church of Antioch on occasion of the appointment of Asclepiades to the episcopate there. According to the <i>Chron.</i> Asclepiades did not become bishop until 211; and though this may not be the exact date, yet it cannot be far out of the way (see chap. 11, note 6); and hence, if Alexander was a confessor in 203, he must have remained in prison a number of years, or else have undergone a second persecution. It is probable either that the date 203 is quite wrong, or else that he suffered a second time toward the close of Severus' reign; for the persecution, so far as we know, was not so continuous during that reign as to keep one man confined for eight years. Our knowledge of the persecutions in Asia Minor at this time is very limited, but they do not seem to have been of great severity or of long duration. The date of Alexander's episcopate in Cappadocia it is impossible to determine, though as he was a fellow-pupil of Origen's in Alexandria, it cannot have begun much, if any, before 202. The date of his translation to the see of Jerusalem is likewise uncertain. The <i>Chron.</i> gives the second year of Caracalla (<i>Armen.</i> fourth). The connection in which Eusebius mentions it in chap. 11 makes it look as if it took place before Asclepiades' accession to the see of Antioch; but this is hardly possible, for it was his firmness under persecution which elevated him to the see of Jerusalem (according to this passage), and it is apparently that persecution which he is enduring when Asclepiades becomes bishop. We find no reason, then, for correcting the date of his translation to Jerusalem given by the <i>Chron.</i> At any rate, he was bishop of Jerusalem when Origen visited Palestine in 216 (see chap. 19, §17). In 231 he assisted at the ordination of Origen (see chap. 23, note 6), and finally perished in prison during the Decian perscution (see chaps. 39 and 46). His friendship for Origen was warm and steadfast (cf., besides the other passages referred to, chap. 27). The latter commemorates the loveliness and gentleness of his character in his first <i>Homily on 1 Samuel,</i> §1. He collected a valuable library in Jerusalem, which Eusebius made use of in the composition of his <i>History</i> (see chap. 20). This act shows the literary tastes of the man. Of his epistles only the five fragments preserved by Eusebius (chaps. 11, 14, and 19) are now extant. Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 62) says that other epistles were extant in his day; and he relates, on the authority of an epistle written <i>pro Origene contra Demetrium,</i> that Alexander had ordained Origen <i>juxta testimonium Demetri.</i> This epistle is not mentioned by Eusebius, but in spite of Jerome's usual dependence upon the latter, there is no good reason to doubt the truth of his statement in this case (see below, p. 396).</p>

<sup>55 </sup>Of these three bishops, Dius, Germanio, and Gordius, we know nothing more than is told us here. Syncellus assigns eight years to Dius, four to Germanio, and five to Sardianus, whom he names instead of Gordius. Epiphanius reports that Dius was bishop until Severus (193 a.d.), and Gordius until Antonine (i.e. Caracalla, 211 a.d.). But no reliance is to be placed upon these figures or dates, as remarked above, Bk. V. chap. 12, note 2.</p>

<sup>58 </sup>The extreme age of Narcissus at this time is evident from the fact that Alexander, writing before the year 216 (see note 4), says that Narcissus is already in his 116th year. The translation of Alexander to Jerusalem must have taken place about 212 (see chap. 8, note 6), and hence Narcissus was now more than 110 years old. The appointment of Alexander as Narcissus' assistant involved two acts which were even at that time not common, and which were later forbidden by canon; first the translation of a bishop from one see to another, and secondly the appointment of an assistant bishop, which made two bishops in one city. The <i>Apost. Canons</i> (No. 14) ordain that "a bishop ought not to leave his own parish and leap to another, although the multitude should compel him, unless there be some good reason forcing him to do this, as that he can contribute much greater profit to the people of the new parish by the word of piety; but this is not to be settled by himself, but by the judgment of many bishops and very great supplication." It has been disputed whether this canon is older or younger than the fifteenth canon of Nicaea, which forbids unconditionally the practice of translation from one see to another. Whichever may be the older, it is certain that even the Council of Nicaea considered its own canon as liable to exceptions in certain cases, for it translated Eustathius from Beraea to Antioch (see Sozomen, <i>H. E.</i> I. 2). The truth is, the rule was established-whether before or for the first time at the Council of Nicaea-chiefly in order to guard against the ambition of aspiring men who might wish to go from a smaller to a greater parish, and to prevent, as the Nicene Canon says, the many disorders and quarrels which the custom of translation caused; and a rule formed on such grounds of expediency was of course liable to exception whenever the good of the Church seemed to demand it, and therefore, whether the fourteenth Apostolic Canon is more ancient than the Nicene Council or not, it certainly embodies a principle which must long have been in force, and which we find in fact acted upon in the present case; for the translation of Alexander takes place "with the common consent of the bishops of the neighboring churches," or, as Jerome puts it, <i>cunctis in Palestina episcopis in unum congregatis,</i> which is quite in accord with the provision of the Apostolic Canons. There were some in the early Church who thought it absolutely unlawful under any circumstances for a bishop to be translated (cf. Jerome's <i>Ep. ad Oceanum;</i> Migne, <i>Ep.</i> 69, §5), but this was not the common view, as Bingham (<i>Antiq.</i> VI. 4. 6) well observes, and instances of translation from one see to another were during all these centuries common (cf. e.g. Socrates, <i>H. E.</i> VII. 36), although always of course exceptional, and considered lawful only when made for good and sufficient reasons. To say, therefore, with Valesius that these Palestinian bishops violated a rule of the Church in translating Alexander is too strong. They were evidently unconscious of anything uncanonical, or even irregular in their action, though it is clear that they regarded the step as too important to be taken without the approval of all the bishops of the neighborhood. In regard to assistant bishops, Valesius correctly remarks that this is the first instance of the kind known to us, but it is by no means the only one, for the following centuries furnish numerous examples; e.g. Theotecnus and Anatolius in Caesarea (see below, Bk. VII. chap. 32), Maximus and Macarius in Jerusalem (see Sozomen, <i>H. E.</i> II. 20); and so in Africa Valerius of Hippo had Augustine as his coadjutor (Possidius, <i>Vita. Aug.</i> chap. 8; see Bingham's <i>Antiq.</i> II. 13. 4 for other instances and for a discussion of the whole subject). The principle was in force from as early as the third century (see Cyprian to Cornelius, <i>Ep.</i> 40, <i>al.</i> 44 and to Antonianus, <i>Ep.</i> 51, <i>al.</i> 55) that there should be only one bishop in a city, and we see from the works of various Fathers that this rule was universally accepted at an early date. The eighth canon of Nicaea refers to this principle in passing as if it were already firmly established, and the council evidently did not think it necessary to promulgate a special canon on the subject. Because of this principle, Augustine hesitated to allow himself to be ordained assistant bishop of Hippo; and although his scruples were overcome at the time, he afterward, upon learning of the Nicene Canon, considered the practice of having a coadjutor illegal and refused to ordain one for himself. But, as the instances referred to above and many others show, not all the Church interpreted the principle as rigidly as Augustine did, and hence under certain circumstances exceptions were made to the rule, and were looked upon throughout the Church as quite lawful. The existence of two bishops in one city as a matter of compromise, for the sake of healing a schism, formed one common exception to the general principle (see Bingham, II. 13. 2), and the appointment of coadjutors, as in the present case, formed another.</p>

<sup>59 </sup>Of what city in Cappadocia Alexander was bishop we are not told by Eusebius, nor by our other ancient authorities. Valesius (note on this passage) and Tillemont (<i>Hist. eccles.</i> III. p. 415) give Flaviopolis or Flaviadis as the name of the city (upon the authority of Basilicon, Fur. Graeco-Rom. Tom. I. p. 295, according to Tillemont). But Flaviopolis was a city of Cilicia, and hence Tillemont conjectures that it had once been taken from Cappadocia and attached to Cilicia, and that its inhabitants retained the memory of Alexander, their early bishop. The report seems to rest upon a very slender foundation; but not having access to the authority cited, I am unable to form an opinion as to the worth of the tradition.</p>

<sup>61 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'Antinoeia</font><font> (Antinoë or Antinoöpolis) was a city of Egypt founded by Hadrian in honor of Antinous (see Bk. IV. chap. 8, note 3). This is the first mention of a church there, but its bishops were present at more than one council in later centuries (see Wiltsch's <i>Geography and Statistics,</i> p. 59, 196, 473). This letter must have been written between 212, at about which time Alexander became Narcissus' coadjutor (see chap. 8, note 6), and 216, when Origen visited Palestine (see chap. 19, note 23). For at the time of that visit Alexander is said to have been bishop of Jerusalem, and no mention is made of Narcissus, who must therefore have been already dead (see Bk. V. chap. 12, note 1). The fragments of Alexander's epistles quoted in this chapter are given in Routh's <i>Rel. Sacrae,</i> II. p. 161 sq., and in English in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> VI. p. 154.</font></p>

<sup>63 </sup>The <i>Chron.</i> puts the accession of Asclepiades in the first year of Caracalla (211 a.d.). Harnack (<i>Zeit des Ignatius,</i> p. 47) believes that this notice rests upon better knowledge than the notices of most of the Antiochian bishops, because in this case the author departs from the artificial scheme which he follows in the main. But Harnack contends that the date is not quite correct, because Alexander, who suffered under Severus, was still in prison when Asclepiades became bishop, and therefore the latter's accession must be put back into Severus' reign. He would fix, therefore, upon about 209 as the date of it, rightly perceiving that there is good reason for thinking the <i>Chron.</i> at least nearly correct in its report, and that in any case his accession cannot be carried back much beyond that, because it is quite probable (from the congratulations which Alexander extends to the church of Antioch) that there had been a vacancy in that church for some time after the death of Serapion (a thing not at all unnatural in the midst of the persecutions of the time), while Serapion was still alive as late as 203 (see Bk. V. chap. 19, note 1). But it seems to me that there is no good ground for making any alteration in the date given by the <i>Chron.,</i> for we know that at the very end of Severus' reign the persecution broke out again with considerable severity, and that it continued, at least in Africa, for some time after Caracalla's accession (see Tertullian's <i>ad Scap.</i>). The general amnesty issued by Caracalla after the murder of his brother Geta in 212 (see Dion Cassius, LXXVII. 3) seems first to have put a definitive end to the persecutions. There is therefore no ground for confining Alexander's imprisonment to the reign of Severus. It may well have run into the time of Caracalla, and hence it is quite possible that Asclepiades did not become bishop until after the latter became emperor, so that it is not necessary to correct the date of the <i>Chron.</i> It is impossible to determine with certainty the length of Asclepiades' episcopate (see chap. 21, note 6). Of Asclepiades himself we know no more than is told us in this chapter. He seems to have been a man of most excellent character, to judge from Alexander's epistle. That epistle, of course, was written immediately after Asclepiades' appointment.</p>

<sup>69 </sup>Of this Domninus we know only what is told us here. It is suggested by Daniell (in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> IV. 630) that this shows that the prohibition uttered by Severus against the Jews "must have been soon relaxed, if it ever was enforced." But in regard to this it must be said, in the first place, that Severus' decree was not levelled against the Jews, but only against conversion to Judaism,-against the <i>fieri,</i> not the <i>esse, Fudaeos.</i> The object of the edict was not to disturb the Jews in the exercise of their national faith, but to prevent their proselyting among the non-Jewish residents of the empire. If Domninus, therefore, fell from Christianity into Judaism on account of the persecution, it seems highly probable that he was simply a converted Jew, who gave up now, in order to avoid persecution, his new faith, and again practised the religion of his fathers. Nothing, therefore, can be concluded from Domninus' case as to the strictness with which Severus' law was carried out, even if we suppose Domninus to have fallen from Christianity into Judaism. But it must be remarked, in the second place, that it is by no means certain that Eusebius means to say that Domninus fell into Judaism, or became a Jew. He is said to have fallen into "ewish will-worship" (<font face="SPIonic">ekpeptwkota epi todaikhn efelofrhskeian</font><font>). The word </font><font face="SPIonic">efelofrhskeia</font><font> occurs fox the first time in Col. ii. 23, and means there an "arbitrary, self-imposed worship" (Ellicott), or a worship which one "affects" (Cremer). The word is used there in connection with the Oriental theosophic and Judaistic errors which were creeping into the churches of Asia Minor at the time the epistle was written, and it is quite possible that the word may be used in the present case in reference to the same classy of errors. We know that these theosophizing and Judaizing tendencies continued to exert considerable influence in Asia Minor and Syria during the early centuries, and that the Ebionites and the Elcesaites were not the only ones affected by them (see Harnack, <i>Dogmengesch.</i> I. 218 sq.). The lapse of any one into Ebionism, or into a Judaizing Gnosticism, or similar form of heresy-a lapse which cannot have been at all uncommon among the fanatical Phrygians and other peoples of that section-might well be called a lapse into "Jewish will-worship." We do not know where Domninus lived, but it is not improbable that Asia Minor was his home, and that he may have fallen under the influence of Montanism as well as of Ebionism and Judaizing Gnosticism. I suggest the possibility that his lapse was into heresy rather than into Judaism pure and simple, for the reason that it is easier, on that ground, to explain the fact that Serapion addressed a work to him. He is known to us only as an opponent of heresy, and it may be that Domninus' lapse gave him an opportunity to attack the heretical notions of these Ebionites, or other Judaizing heretics, as he had attacked the Montanists. It seems to the writer, also, that it is thus easier to explain the complex phrase used, which seems to imply something different from Judaism pure and simple.</font></p>

<sup>73 </sup>This Marcianus is an otherwise unknown personage, unless we are to identify him, as Salmon suggests is possible, with Marcion. The suggestion is attractive, and the reference to <i>Docetae</i> gives it a show of probability. But there are serious objections to be urged against it. In the first place, the form of the name, <font face="SPIonic">Markianoi</font><font> instead of </font><font face="SPIonic">Markiwn</font><font>. The two names are by no means identical Still, according to Harnack, we have more than once </font><font face="SPIonic">Markianoi</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">Markianistai</font><font> for </font><font face="SPIonic">Makiwn</font><font> (see his <i>Quellenkritik d. Gesch. d. Gnosticismus,</i> p. 31 sqq.). But again, how can Marcion have used, or his name been in any way connected with, a Gospel of <i>Peter?</i> Finally, the impression left by this passage is that "Marcianus" was a man still living, or at any rate alive shortly before Serapion wrote, for the latter seems only recently to have learned what his doctrines were. He certainly cannot have been so ignorant of the teachings of the great "heresiarch" Marcion. We must, in fact, regard the identification as improbable.</font></p>
<p><a name="P3657_1700577"></a>
<sup>74 </sup>By Docetism we understand the doctrine that Christ had no true body, but only an apparent one. The word is derived from <font face="SPIonic">dokew</font><font>, "to seem or appear." The belief is as old as the first century (cf. 1 John iv. 2; 2 John 7), and was a favorite one with most of the Gnostic sects. The name <i>Docetae,</i> however, as a general appellation for all those holding this opinion, seems to have been used first by Theodoret (<i>Ep.</i> 82). But the term was employed to designate a particular sect before the end of the second century; thus Clement of Alexandria speaks of them in <i>Strom.</i> VII. 17, and Hippolytus (<i>Phil.</i> VIII. 8. 4, and X. 12; <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Amer. ed.), and it is evidently this particular sect to which Serapion refers here. An examination of Hippolytus' account shows that these <i>Docetae</i> did not hold what we call Docetic ideas of Christ's body; in fact, Hippolytus says expressly that they taught that Christ was born, and had a true body from the Virgin (see <i>Phil.</i> VIII. 3). How the sect came to adopt the name of <i>Docetae</i> we cannot tell. They seem to have disappeared entirely before the fourth century, for no mention of them is found in Epiphanius and other later heresiologists. As was remarked above, Theodoret uses the term in a general sense and not as the appellation of a particular sect, and this became the common usage, and is still. Whether there was anything in the teaching of the sect to suggest the belief that Christ had only an apparent body, and thus to lead to the use of their specific name for all who held that view, or whether the general use of the name <i>Docetae</i> arose quite independently of the sect name, we do not know. The latter seems more probable. The <i>Docetae</i> referred to by Hippolytus being a purely Gnostic sect with a belief in the reality of Christ's body, we have no reason to conclude that the "Gospel of Peter" contained what we call Docetic teaching. The description which Serapion gives of the gospel fits quite well a work containing some such Gnostic speculations as Hippolytus describes, and thus adding to the Gospel narrative rather than denying the truth of it in any part. He could hardly have spoken as he did of a work which denied the reality of Christ's body. See, on the general subject, Salmon's articles <i>Docetae</i> and <i>Docetism in the Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i></font></p>

<sup>75 </sup>The interpretation of these last two clauses is beset with difficulty. The Greek reads <font face="SPIonic">twn diadoxwn twn katacamenwn autou, ouj Dokhtaj kaloumen, (ta gar fronhmata ta pleiona ekeinwn esti thj didaskaliaj), k.t.l</font><font>. The words </font><font face="SPIonic">twn katarcamenwn autou</font><font> are usually translated "who preceded him," or "who led the way before him"; but the phrase hardly seems to admit of this interpretation, and moreover the </font><font face="SPIonic">autou</font><font> seems to refer not to Marcianus, whose name occurs some lines back, but to the gospel which has just been mentioned. There is a difficulty also in regard to the reference of the </font><font face="SPIonic">ekeinwn</font><font>, which is commonly connected with the words </font><font face="SPIonic">thj didaskaliaj</font><font>, but which seems to belong rather with the </font><font face="SPIonic">fronhmata</font><font> and to refer to the </font><font face="SPIonic">diadocwn twj katarcamenwn</font><font>. It thus seems necessary to define the </font><font face="SPIonic">thj didaskaliaj</font><font> more closely, and we therefore venture, with Closs, to insert the words "of that school," referring to the <i>Docetae</i> just mentioned.</font></p>

<sup>76 </sup><font>On the life of Clement, see Bk. V. chap. 11, note 1. He was a very prolific writer, as we can gather from the list of works mentioned in this chapter. The list is repeated by Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> c. 38) and by Photius (<i>Cod.</i> 109-111), the former of whom merely copies from Eusebius, with some mistakes, while the latter copies from Jerome, as is clear from the similar variations in the titles given by the last two from those given by Eusebius, and also by the omission in both their lists of one work named by Eusebius (see below, note 10). Eusebius names ten works in this chapter. In addition to these there are extant two quotations from a work of Clement entitled </font><font face="SPIonic">peri proniaj</font><font>. There are also extant two fragments of a work </font><font face="SPIonic">peri yuxhj</font><font>. In the <i>Instructor,</i> Bk. II. chap. 10, Clement refers to a work <i>On Continence</i> (</font><font face="SPIonic">o peri egkrateiaj</font><font>) as already written by himself, and there is no reason to doubt that this was a separate work, for the third book of the <i>Stromata</i> (to which Fabricius thinks he refers), which treats of the same subject, was not yet written. The work is no longer extant. In the <i>Instructor,</i> Bk. III. chap. 8, Clement speaks of a work which he had written <i>On Marriage</i> (</font><font face="SPIonic">gamikoj logoj</font><font>). It has been thought possible that he may have referred here to his discussion of the same subject in Bk. II. chap. 10 of the same work (see the Bishop of Lincoln's work on Clement, p. 7), but it seems more probable that he referred to a separate work now lost. Potter, p. 1022, gives a fragment which is possibly from this work.</font></p>
<p>In addition to these works, referred to as already written, Clement promises to write on <i>First Principles</i> (<font face="SPIonic">peri arxwn</font>; <i>Strom.</i> III. 3, IV. 1, 13, V. 14, <i>et al.</i>); on <i>Prophecy</i> (<i>Strom.</i> I. 24, IV. 13, V. 13); on <i>Angels</i> (<i>Strom.</i> VI. 13); on the <i>Origin of the World</i> (<i>Strom.</i> VI. 18),-perhaps a part of the proposed work on <i>First Principles,</i> and perhaps to be identified with the commentary on Genesis, referred to below by Eusebius (see note 28),-<i>Against Heresies</i> (<i>Strom.</i> IV. 13), on the <i>Resurrection</i> (<i>Instructor,</i> I. 6, II. 10). It is quite possible that Clement regarded his promises as fulfilled by the discussions which he gives in various parts of the <i>Stromata</i> themselves, or that he gave up his original purpose.</p>

<sup>77 </sup>Clement's three principal works, the <i>Exhortation to the Greeks</i> (see below, note 5), the <i>Instructor</i> (note 6), and the <i>Stromata,</i> form a connected series of works, related to one another (as Schaff says) very much as apologetics, ethics, and dogmatics. The three works were composed in the order named. The <i>Stromata</i> (<font face="SPIonic">Strwmateij</font><font>) or <i>Miscellanies</i> (said by Eusebius in this passage to bear the title </font><font face="SPIonic">twn kata thn alhqh filosofian gnwstikwn upomnhmatwn strwmateij</font><font>) are said by Eusebius and by Photius (<i>Cod.</i> 109) to consist of eight books. Only seven are now extant, although there exists a fragment purporting to be a part of the eighth book, but which is in reality a portion of a treatise on logic, while in the time of Photius some reckoned the tract <i>Quis dives salvetur</i> as the eighth book (Photius, <i>Cod.</i> 111). There thus exists no uniform tradition as to the character of the lost book, and the suggestion of Westcott seems plausible, that at an early date the logical introduction to the <i>Hypotyposes</i> was separated from the remainder of the work, and added to some mss. of the <i>Stromata</i> as an eighth book. If this be true, the <i>Stromata</i> consisted originally of only seven books, and hence we now have the whole work (with the exception of a fragment lost at the beginning). The name </font><font face="SPIonic">Strwmateij</font><font>, "patchwork," sufficiently indicates the character of the work. It is without methodical arrangement, containing a heterogeneous mixture of science, philosophy, poetry, and theology, and yet is animated by one idea throughout,-that Christianity satisfies the highest intellectual desires of man,-and hence the work is intended in some sense as a guide to the deeper knowledge of Christianity, the knowledge to be sought after by the "true Gnostic." It is full of rich thoughts mingled with worthless crudities, and, like nearly all of Clement's works, abounds in wide and varied learning, not always fully digested. The date at which the work was composed may be gathered from a passage in Bk. I. chap. 21, where a list of the Roman emperors is closed with a mention of Commodus, the exact length of whose reign is given, showing that he was already dead, but also showing apparently that his successor was still living. This would lead us to put the composition at least of the first book in the first quarter of the year x93. It might of course be said that Pertinax and Didins Julianus are omitted in this list because of the brevity of their reigns, and this is possible, since in his own list he gives the reigns of the emperors simply by years, omitting Otho and Vitellius. The other list which he quotes, however, gives every emperor, with the number of years, months, and even days of each reign,so that there is no reason, at least in that list, for the omission of Pertinax and Didius Julianus. It seems probable that, under the influence of that exact list, and of the recentness of the reigns of the two emperors named, Clement can hardly have omitted them if they had already ruled. We can say with absolute certainty, however, only that the work was written after 192. Clement left Alexandria in 202. or before, and this, as well as me rest of his works, was written in all probability before that time at the latest.</font></p>
<p>The standard edition of Clement's works is that of Potter, Oxford, 1715, in two vols. (reprinted in Migne's <i>Patr. Gr.,</i> Vols. VIII. and IX.). Complete English translation in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Amer. ed., Vol. II. On his writings, see especially Westcott's article in the <i>Dict. of Christ.

<sup>78 </sup>The <i>Hypatyposes</i> (<font face="SPIonic">upotupwseij</font><font>), or <i>Outlines</i> (Eusebius calls them </font><font face="SPIonic">oi epigegrammenoi</font><font>), are no longer extant, though fragments have been preserved. The work (which was in eight books, according to this passage) is referred to by Eusebius, in Bk. I. chap. 12 (the fifth book), in Bk. II. chap. 1 (the sixth and seventh books), in Bk. II. chaps. 9 and 23 (the seventh book), chap. 15 (the sixth book), in Bk. V. chap. 11, and in Bk. VI. chap. 14 (the book not specified). Most of these extracts are of a historical character, but have to do (most of them, not all) with the apostolic age, or the New Testament. We are told in chap. 14 that the work contained abridged accounts of all the Scriptures, but Photius (<i>Cod.</i> 109) says that it seems to have dealt only with Genesis, Exodus, the Psalms, Ecclesiastes, the epistles of Paul, and the Catholic epistles (</font><font face="SPIonic">o de oloj skopoj wsanei ermhneiai tugxanousi thj Tegesewj k.t.l</font><font>.). Besides the detached quotations there are extant three series of extracts which are supposed to have been taken from the <i>Hypotyposes.</i> These are <i>The Summaries from Theadotus, The Prophetic Selections,</i> and the <i>Outlines on the Catholic Epistles.</i> On these fragments, which are very corrupt and desultory, see Westcott in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> They discuss all sorts of doctrines, and contain the interpretations of the most various schools, and it is not always clearly stated whether Clement himself adopts the opinion given, or whether he is simply quoting from another for the purpose of refuting him. Photius condemns parts of the <i>Hypotyposes</i> severely, but it seems, from these extracts which we have, that he may have read the work, full as it was of the heretical opinions of other men and schools, without distinguishing Clement's own opinions from those of others, and that thus he may carelessly have attributed to him all the wild notions which be mentions. These extracts as well as the various references of Eusebius show that the work, like most of the others which Clement wrote, covered a great deal of ground, and included discussions of a great many collateral subjects. It does not seem, in fact, to have been much more systematic than the <i>Instructor</i> or even the <i>Stromata.</i> It seems to have been intended as a part of the great series, of which the <i>Exhortation,</i> <i>Instructor,</i> and <i>Stromata</i> were the first three. If so, it followed them. We have no means of ascertaining its date more exactly.</font></p>

<sup>80 </sup>The <i>Exhortation to the Greeks</i> (<font face="SPIonic">o logoj portreptikoj 55 Ellhnaj</font><font>), the first of the series of three works mentioned in note 2, is still extant in its entirety. It is called by Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> chap. 38) <i>Adversus Genies, liber unus,</i> but, as Westcott remarks, it was addressed not to the Gentiles in general, but to the Greeks, as its title and its contents alike indicate. The general aim of the book is to "prove the superiority of Christianity to the religions and philosophies of heathendom," and thus to lead the unbeliever to accept it. It is full of Greek mythology and speculation, and exhibits, as Schaff says, almost a waste of learning. It was written before the <i>Instructor,</i> as we learn from a reference to it in the latter (chap. 1). It is stated above (Bk. V. chap. 28, §4), by the anonymous writer against the Artemonites, that Clement wrote (at least some of his works) before the time of Victor of Rome (i.e. before 192 a.d.), and hence Westcott concludes that this work was written about 190, which cannot be far out of the way.</font></p>

<sup>81 </sup><i>The Instructor</i> (<font face="SPIonic">o paisagwgoj</font><font>, or, as Eusebius calls it here, </font><font face="SPIonic">treij te oi toy epigegrammenou paidagwgou</font><font>), is likewise extant, in three books. The work is chiefly of a moral and practical character, designed to furnish the new convert with rules for the proper conduct of his life over against the prevailing immoralities of the heathen. Its date is approximately fixed by the fact that it was written after the <i>Exhortation</i> to which it refers, and before the <i>Stromata,</i> which refers to it (see <i>Strom.</i> VI. 1).</font></p>

<sup>82 </sup>The <i>Quis Dives Salvetur?</i> as it is called (<font face="SPIonic">tij o swzomenoj plousioj</font><font>), is a brief tract, discussing the words of Christ in Mark x. 17 sqq. It is still extant, and contains the beautiful story of John and the robber, quoted by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap. 23. It is an eloquent and able work; and when compared with the prevailing notions of the Church of his day, its teaching is remarkably wise and temperate. It is moderately ascetic, but goes to no extremes, and in this furnishes a pleasing contrast to the writings of most of the Fathers of Clement's time.</font></p>

Two fragments of it are found in the <i>Chronicon Paschale,</i> and are given by Potter. The work was composed, according to §9, below, at the instigation of friends, who urged him to commit to writing the traditions which he had received from the ancient presbyters. From Bk. IV. chap. 26, we learn that it was written in reply to Melito's work on the same subject (see notes 5 and 23 on that chapter); and hence we may conclude that it was undertaken at the solicitation of friends who desired to see the arguments presented by Melito, as a representative of the Quartodeciman practice, refined. The date of the work we have no means of ascertaining, for Melito's work was written early in the sixties (see <i>ibid.</i>).</font></p>

It is no longer extant, but a few fragments have been preserved, and are given by Potter.</font></p>
<p>Danz (<i>De Eusebio,</i> p. 90) refers to Clement's <i>Stromata,</i> lib. VI. p. 803, ed. Potter, where he says that "the ecclesiastical canon is the agreement or disagreement of the law and the prophets with the testament given at the coming of Christ." Danz concludes accordingly that in this work Clement wished to show to those who believed that the teaching of the law and the prophets was not only different from, but Superior to the teachings of the Christian faith,-that is, to the Judaizers,-that the writers of the Old and New 'Testaments were in full harmony. This might do, were it not for the fact that the work is directed not against Jews, but against Judaizers, i.e. Judaizing Christians. A work to prove the Old and New Testament in harmony with each other could hardly have been addressed to such persons, ho must have believed them in harmony before they became Christians. The truth is, the phrase <font face="SPIonic">kanwn ekklhsiastikoj</font> is used by the Fathers with a great variety of meanings, and the fact that Clement used it in one sense in one of his works by no means proves that he always used it in the same sense. It is more probable that the work was devoted to a discussion of certain practices or modes of living in which the Judaizers differed from the rest of the Church Catholic, perhaps in respect to feasts (might a reference to the Quartodeciman practice havebeen perhaps included?), fasts and other ascetic practices, observance of the Jewish Sabbaths, &amp;c. This use of the word in the sense of <i>regula</i> was very common (see Suicer's <i>Thesaurus</i>). The work was dedicated, according to Eusebius, to the bishop Alexander, mentioned above in chap. 8 and elsewhere. This is sufficient evidence that it was written considerably later than the three great works already referred to. Alexander was a student of Clement's; and since he was likewise a fellow-pupil of Origen's (see chap. 8, note 6), his student days under Clement must have extended at least nearly to the time when Clement left Alexandria (i.e. in or before 202. a.d.). But Clement of course cannot have dedicated a work to him while he was still his pupil, and in fact we shall be safe in saying that Alexander must ave gained some prominence before Clement would be led to dedicate a work to him. We think naturally of the period which Clement spent with him while he was in prison and before he became bishop of Jerusalem (see chap. 11). It is quite possible that Clement's residence in Cappadocia with Alexander had given him such an acquaintance with Judaizing heresies and practices that he felt constrained to write against them, and at the same time had given him such an affection for Alexander that he dedicated his work to him.</p>

<sup>90 </sup>The Wisdom of Solomon and the Wisdom of Sirach were two Old Testament apocryphal books. The Church of the first three centuries made, on the whole, no essential difference between the books of the Hebrew canon and the Apocrypha. We find the Fathers, almost without exception, quoting from both indiscriminately. It is true that catalogues were made by Melito, Origen, Athanasius, and others, which separated the Apocrypha fro.m the books of the He: brew canon; but this represented theory simply, not practice, and did not prevent even themselves from using both classes as Scripture. Augustine went so far as to obliterate completely all distinction between the two, in theory as well as in practice. The only one of the early Fathers to make a decided stand against the Apocrypha was Jerome; but he was not able to change the common view, and the Church continued (as the Catholic Church continues still) to use them all (with a few minor exceptions) as Holy Scripture.</p>

<sup>96 </sup>This Cassianus is mentioned twice by Clement: once in <i>Strom.</i> I. 21, where Clement engages in a chronological study for the purpose of showing that the wisdom of the Hebrews is older than that of the Greeks, and refers to Cassian's <i>Exegetica</i> and Tatian's <i>Address to the Greeks</i> as containing discussions of the same subject; again in <i>Strom.</i> III. 13 sqq., where he is said to have been the founder of the sect of the <i>Dacetae,</i> and to have written a work, <i>De continentia</i> or <i>De castitate</i> (<font face="SPIonic">peri egkrateiaj h peri eunouxiaj</font><font>), in which he condemned marriage. Here, too, he is associated with Tatian. He seems from these references to have been, like Tatian, an apologist for Christianity, and also like him to have gone off into an extreme asceticism, which the Church pronounced heretical (see Bk. IV. chap. 29, note 4). Whether he was personally connected with Tatian, or is mentioned with him by Clement simply because his views were similar, we do not know, nor can we fix the date at which he lived. Neither of his works referred to by Clement is now extant. Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> chap. 38) mentions the work which Eusebius speaks of here, but says that he had not been able to find a copy of it. It is called by Clement, in the passage referred to here by Eusebius, </font><font face="SPIonic">'Echghtikoi</font><font>, and so Eusebius calls it in his <i>Praeef. Evang.</i> X. 12, where he quotes from Clement. But here he speaks of it as a </font><font face="SPIonic">xronografia</font><font>, and Jerome transcribes the word without translating it. We can gather from Clement's words (<i>Strom.</i> I. 21) that the work of Cassianus dealt largely with chronology, and hence Eusebius' reference to it under the name </font><font face="SPIonic">xronografia</font><font> is quite legitimate.</font></p>

<sup>98 </sup>The Aristobulus referred to here was an Alexandrian Jew and Peripatetic philosopher (see the passages in Clement and Eusebius referred to below), who lived in the second century b.c., and was the author of <i>Commentaries upon the Mosaic Law,</i> the chief object of which was to prove that Greek philosophy was borrowed from the books of Moses (see Clement, <i>Strom.</i> V. 14, who refers only to Peripatetic philosophy, which is too narrow). The work is referred to by Clement of Alexandria (in his <i>Stromata,</i> I. 15; V. 14; VI. 3, &amp;c.), by Eusebius (in his <i>Praep. Evang.</i> VII. 14; VIII. 9, 10; XIII. 12, &amp;c.) by Anatolius (as quoted by Eusebius below, in Bk. VII. chap. 32), and by other Fathers. The work is no longer extant, but Eusebius gives two considerable fragments of it in his <i>Praep. Evang.</i> VIII. 10, and XIII. 12. See Schürer's <i>Gesch. d. jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu,</i> II. p. 760 sq. Schürer maintains the authenticity of the work against the attacks of many modem critics.</p>

Demetrius is mentioned by Josephus (who, however, wrongly makes him a heathen; <i>contra Apionem,</i> I. 23), by Clement of Alexandria, and by Eusebius. His work is no longer extant, but fragments of it are preserved by Clement (<i>Strom.</i> I. 21) and by Eusebius (<i>Praep. Evang.</i> IX. 21 and 29). See Schürer, <i>ibid.</i> p. 730 sq.</p>

<sup>101 </sup>Eupolymus was also a Jewish historian, who wrote about the middle of the second century b.c., and is possibly to be identified with the Eupolymus mentioned in 1. Macc. viii. 17. He wrote a <i>History of the Jews,</i> which is referred to under various titles by those that mention it, and which has consequently been resolvent into three separate works by many scholars, but without warrant, as Schürer has shown. The work, like that of Aristobulus, was clearly designed to show the dependence of Greek philosophy upon Hebrew wisdom (see Clement's <i>Strom.</i> I. 23). It is no longer extant, but fragments have been preserved by Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom.</i> I. 21, which gives us data for reckoning the time at which Eupolymus wrote, and I. 23) and by Eusebius (<i>Praep. Evang.</i> IX. 17, 26, 30-34, and probably 39). See Schürer <i>ibid.</i> p. 732 sq.</p>

<sup>102 </sup>Eusebius is apparently still referring to Clement's <i>Stromata.</i> In saying that Clement <font face="SPIonic">wn en tw prwtw peri eautou dhloi wj eggista thj twn apostotolwn genomenou diadochj</font><font>, he was perhaps thinking of the passage in <i>Strom.</i> I. 1, where Clement says, "They [i.e. his teachers], preserving the tradition of the blessed doctrine, derived directly from the holy apostles, Peter, James, John, and Paul, the sons receiving it from the fathers (but few were like the fathers), came by God's will to us also to deposit those ancestral and apostolic seeds." Clement in this passage does not mean to assert that his teachers were immediate disciples of the apostles, but only that they received the traditions of the apostles in direct descent from their immediate disciples. Eusebius' words are a little ambiguous, but they seem to imply that he thought that Clement was a pupil of immediate disciples of the apostles, which Clement does not assert in this passage, and can hardly have asserted in any passage, for he was in all probability born too late to converse with those who had seen any of the apostles.</font></p>
<p><a name="P3697_1727812"></a>
<sup>103 </sup>In his <i>Stromata</i> (VI. 18) Clement refers to a work on the origin of the world, which was probably to form a part of his work <i>On Principles.</i> This is perhaps the reference of which Eusebius is thinking when he says that Clement in the <i>Stromata</i> promises <font face="SPIonic">eij thn Tenesin upomnmatiesqein</font><font>. If so, Eusebius' words, which imply that Clement promised to write a commentary on Genesis, are misleading.</font></p>
