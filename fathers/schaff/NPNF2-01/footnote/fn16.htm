<sup>69 </sup>Pella was a town situated beyond the Jordan, in the north of Perea, within the dominions of Herod Agrippa II. The surrounding population was chiefly Gentile. See Pliny V. I8, and Josephus, <i>B. F.</i> III. 3. 3, and I. 4. 8. Epiphanius (<i>De pond. et mens.</i> 15) also records this flight of the Christians to Pella.</p>

<sup>72 </sup><i>B. F.</i> VI. 9,§§3 and 4. Eusebius simply gives round numbers. Josephus in §3 puts the number at 2,700,000, exclusive of the "unclean and the strangers" who were not allowed to eat the Passover. In the same work, Bk. II. chap. 14, §3, Josephus states that when Cestius Gallus, governor of Syria, came to Jerusalem at the time of the Passover in 65 a.d., no less than 3,000,000 persons came about him to enter complaint against the procurator Florus. These numbers are grossly exaggerated. Tacitus estimates the number in the city at the time of the siege as 600,000, but this, too, is far above the truth. The writer of the article<i>Ferusalem,</i> in Smith's<i>Bible Dict.,</i> estimates that the city can never have had a population of more than 50,000 souls, and he concludes that at the time of the siege there cannot have been more than 60,000 or 70,000 collected within the walls. This is probably too low an estimate, but shows how far out of the way the figures of Josephus and Tacitus must be. </p>

<sup>78 </sup><font face="SPIonic">'Attikwn tessarwn</font><font>; the word </font><font face="SPIonic">draxmwn</font><font> is to be supplied.

Some of the mss. of Josephus read </font><font face="SPIonic">hdh</font><font>, and Rufinus translates <i>nam et ego prior comedi.</i> Valesius, without ms. authority (but apparently with the support of some mss. of Josephus, for Whiston translates "one-half") reads </font><font face="SPIonic">hmisu</font><font>, a half, and he is followed by the English and German translators. Some change from the reading of the mss. of Eusebius is certainly necessary; and though the alteration made by Valesius produces very good sense and seems quite natural, I have preferred to accept the reading which is given by many of the mss. of Josephus, and which has the support of Rufinus.</font></p>

<p><a name="P1658_776962"></a>
<sup>83 </sup>Josephus, <i>B. J.</i> Bk. VI. chap. 9, §3. Josephus simply says that the whole number of those that perished during the siege was 1,100,000; he does not specify the manner of their death. On the accuracy of the numbers which he gives, see above, chap. 5, note 13.</p>

<sup>85 </sup><font face="SPIonic">eij ta kat= sAigupton erga</font><font>. The works meant are the great stone quarries of Egypt (commonly called the mines of Egypt), which furnished a considerable part of the finest marble used for building purposes in Rome and elsewhere. The quarries were chiefly in the hands of the Roman government, and the work of quarrying was done largely by captives taken in war, as in the present case.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1661_778230"></a>
<sup>86 </sup>Josephus does not say that the number of those sold as slaves was upward of 90,000, as Eusebius asserts, but simply (<i>ibid.</i> §3) that the number of captives taken during the whole war was 97,000, a number which Eusebius, through an error, applies to the one class of prisoners that were sold as slaves.</p>
<p><a name="P1663_778623"></a>
<sup>87 </sup>In <i>B. J.</i> Bk. VI. 8. 5 and 10. 1 Josephus puts the completion of the siege on the eighth of the month Elul (September), and in the second passage he puts it in the second year of Vespasian. Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Egypt July 1, 69, so that Sept. 8 of his second year would be Sept. 8, a.d. 70. (Cf. Schürer, <i>N. T. Zeitgesch.</i> p. 347.)</p>

<sup>91 </sup>It is but right to remark that not merely the negative school of critics, but even many conservative scholars (e.g. Weiss) put the composition of the Gospel of Luke after the year 70, because its eschatological discourses seem to bear the mark of having been recorded after the fulfillment of the prediction, differing as they do in many minor particulars from the accounts of the same discourses in Matthew and Mark. To cite a single instance: in the passage quoted just above from Luke xxi. 20, the armies encompassing Jerusalem are mentioned, while in parallel passages in the other Gospels (Matt. xxiv. 15 and Mark xiii. 14) not armies, but "the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place" is spoken of as the sign. Compare the various commentaries upon these passages.</p>
<p><a name="P1672_781456"></a>
<sup>92 </sup>Compare Acts iii. 14, and see Matt. xvii. 20, Mark xv. 11, Luke xxii. 18.</p>

<sup>94 </sup>Josephus, <i>B. J.</i> Bk. VI. chap. 5, §3.</p>
<p><a name="P1680_782884"></a>
<sup>95 </sup><font face="SPIonic">katayeudomenoi tou qeou</font><font>. In the previous paragraph Josephus says that a great many false prophets were suborned by the tyrants to impose on the people. It is to these false prophets therefore that he refers here, and I have consequently felt at liberty thus to translate the Greek word given above, instead of rendering merely "liars against God" (as Crusè does), which is indefinite, and might have various meanings.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1682_783837"></a>
<sup>96 </sup>The feast referred to is the feast of the Passover. The Greek name of the month used here is <font face="SPIonic">canqikoj</font><font>, which was the name of a Macedonian month corresponding to our April. According to Whiston, Josephus regularly used this name for the Jewish month Nisan (the first month of the Jewish year), in which case this event took place six days before the Passover, which began on the 14th of Nisan.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1686_785007"></a>
<sup>97 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Artemisioj</font><font>. According to Liddell and Scott, this was a Spartan and Macedonian month corresponding to a part of the ninth Attic month (</font><font face="SPIonic">elafhboliwn</font><font>), which in turn corresponded to the latter part of our March and the early part of April. According to Wieseler, Josephus used the word to denote the second month of the Jewish year, the month Iyar.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1688_785994"></a>
<sup>98 </sup>The majority of the mss. of Eusebius read <font face="SPIonic">metabainomen</font><font>, "we go hence." But at least one of the best mss. and a majority of the mss. of Josephus, supported by Rufinus and Jerome (who render <i>migremus</i>), read </font><font face="SPIonic">metabainwmen</font><font>, "let us go hence," and I have followed Stephanus, Valesius, Stroth, and the English and German translators in adopting that reading.</font></p>
<p><a name="P1690_786484"></a>
<sup>99 </sup>That is, in 62 a.d. for, according to Josephus, the war began in 66 a.d. A little further on, Josephus says that he continued his cry for seven years and five months, when he was slain during the siege of Jerusalem. This shows that he is here, as well as elsewhere, reckoning the date of the beginning of the war as 66 a.d.</p>
<p><a name="P1691_786972"></a>
<sup>100 </sup>That is, the Feast of Tabernacles, which began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Jewish year, and continued seven days.</p>
<p><a name="P1694_787800"></a>
<sup>101 </sup>This was Albinus, as we should know from the date of the event, and as Josephus directly states in the context. He was procurator from 61 or 62 to 64 a.d. See above, Bk. II. chap. 23, note 35, and chap. 22, note I.</p>
