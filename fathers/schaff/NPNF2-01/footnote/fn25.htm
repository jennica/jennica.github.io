<sup>129 </sup>Of the many extant and non-extant works attributed to Justin by tradition, all, or the most of them (except the seven mentioned by Eusebius, and the work <i>Against Marcion,</i> quoted by Irenaeus,-see just below,-and the <i>Syntagma Contra omnes Haer.</i>), are the productions of later writers.</p>

<sup>134 </sup>As was remarked in chap. 11, note 18, Anicetus held office until 165 or 167, i.e. possibly until the seventh year of Marcus Aurelius. The date therefore given here for the accession of Soter is at least a year out of the way. The Armenian <i>Chron.</i> puts his accession in the 236th Olympiad, i.e. the fourth to the seventh year of this reign, while the version of Jerome puts it in the ninth year. From Bk. V. chap. 1 we learn that he held office eight years, andthis is the figure given by both versions of the <i>Chron.</i> In chap. 23 Eusebius quotes from a letter of Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, addressed to Soter, in which he remarks that the Corinthian church have been reading on the Lord's day an epistle written to them by Soter. It was during his episcopate that Montanus labored in Asia Minor, and the anonymous author of the work called Praedestinatus (written in the middle of the fifth century) states that Soter wrote a treatise against him which was answered by Tertullian, but there seems to be no foundation for the tradition. Two spurions epistles and several decretals have been falsely ascribed to him.</p>

<sup>137 </sup>Of Agrippinus we know only what Eusebius tells us here and in Bk. V. chap. 9, where he says that he held office twelve years. Jerome's version of the <i>Chron.</i> agrees as to the duration of his episcopate, but puts his accession in the sixth year of Marcus Aurelius. In the Armenian version a curious mistake occurs in connection with his name. Under the ninth year of Marcus Aurelius are found the words, <i>Romanorum ecclesiae XII. episcopus constitutus est Agrippinus annis IX.,</i> and then Eleutherus (under the thirteenth year of the same ruler) is made the thirteenth bishop, while Victor, his successor, is not numbered, and Zephyrinus the successor of the latter, is made number fourteen. It is of course plain enough that the transcriber by an oversight read <i>Romanorum ecclesiae</i> instead of <i>Alexandrinae ecclesiae,</i> and then having given Soter just above/as the eleventh bishop he felt compelled to make Agrippinus the twelfth, and hence reversed the two numbers, nine and twelve, given in connection with Agrippinus and made him the twelfth bishop, ruling nine years, instead of the ninth bishop, ruling twelve years. He then found himself obliged to make Eleutherus the thirteenth, but brought the list back into proper shape again by omitting to number Victor as the fourteenth. It is hard to understand how a copyist could commit such a flagrant error and not discover it when he found himself subsequently led into difficulty by it. It simply shows with what carelessness the work of translation or of transcription was done. As a result of the mistake no ninth bishop of Alexandria is mentioned, though the proper interval of twelve years remains between the death of Celadion and the accession of Julian.</p>

These dates, however, are quite unreliable, and we have no means of correcting them (see Harnack's <i>Zeit des Ignatius,</i> p. 12 sqq.). Theophilus, the successor of Eros we have reason to think became bishop about the middle of Marcus Aurelius' reign and hence the <i>Chron.,</i> which puts his accession into the ninth year of that reign, (169 a.d.) cannot be far out of the way. This gives us the approximate date for the death of Eros.</p>

<sup>150 </sup>Irenaeus was born in Asia Minor, probably between the years 120 and 130. There is great uncertainty as to the date of his birth, some bringing it down almost to the middle of the second century, while Dodwell carried it back to the year 97 or 98. But these extremes are wild; and a careful examination of all the sources which can throw any light on the subject leads to the conclusion adopted by Lipsius, and stated above. In Asia Minor he was a pupil of Polycarp (cf. the fragment of Irenaeus' letter to Florinus, quoted by Eusebius, Bk. V. chap. 20). The Moscow ms. of the <i>Martyrium Polycarpi</i> states that Irenaeus was in Rome at the time of Polycarp's martyrdom (155 or 156 a.d.), and appeals for its authority to a statement in Irenaeus' own writings, which does not exist in any extant work, but may have been taken from an authentic work now lost (cf. Gebhardt, in the <i>Zeitschrift für die hist. Theologie,</i> 1875, p. 362 sqq.). But whatever truth there may be in the report, we find him, at the time of the great persecution of Lyons and Vienne (described in the next book, chap. 1), a presbyter of the church at Lyons, and carrying a letter from the confessors of that church to the bishop Eleutherus of Rome (see Bk. V. chap. 4). After the death of Pothinus. which took place in 177 (see Bk. V. praef. note 3, and chap. 1, §29), Irenaeus became bishop of Lyons, according to Bk. V. chap. 5. The exact date of his accession we do not know; but as Pothinus died during the persecution, and Irenaeus was still a presbyter after the close of the persecution in which he met his death, he cannot have succeeded immediately. Since Irenaeus, however, was, according to Eusebius, Pothinus' next successor, no great length of time can have elapsed between the death of the latter and the accession of the former. At the time of the paschal controversy, while Victor was bishop of Rome, Irenaeus was still bishop (according to Bk. V. chap. 23). This was toward the close of the second century. His death is ordinarily put in the year 202 or 203, on the assumption that he suffered martyrdom under Septimius Severus. Jerome is the first to call him a martyr, and that not in his <i>de vir. ill.,</i> but in his <i>Comment. in Esaiam</i> (chap. 64), which was written some years later. It is quite possible that he confounded the Iren`us in question with another of the same name, who met his death in the persecution of Diocletian. Gregory of Tours first gives us a detailed account of the martyrdom, and in the Middle Ages Iren`us always figured as a martyr. But all this has no weight at all, when measured against the silence of Tertullian, Hippolytus, Eusebius, and all the earlier Fathers. Their silence must be accepted as conclusive evidence that he was not a martyr; and if he was not, there is no reason for assigning his death to the year 202 or 203. As we have no trace of him, however, subsequent to the time of the paschal controversy, it is probable that he died, at the latest, soon after the beginning of the third century.</p>
<p>Irenaeus was the most important of the polemical writers of antiquity, and his works formed a storehouse from which all subsequent heresiographers drew. He is quoted very frequently by Eusebius as an authority for events which happened during the second century, and is treated by him with the most profound respect as one of the greatest writers of the early Church. Jerome devotes an unusually long chapter of his <i>de vir. ill.</i> to him (chap. 35), but tells us nothing that is not found in Eusebius' History. His greatest work, and the only one now extant, is his <font face="SPIonic">Elegxoj kai anarroph thj yeuownumou gnwsewj</font><font>, which is commonly cited under the brief title </font><font face="SPIonic">proj aireseij</font><font>, or <i>Adversus Haereses</i> ("Against Heresies"). It consists of five books, and is extant only in a very ancient and literal Latin translation; though the numerous extracts made from it by later writers have preserved for us the original Greek of nearly the whole of the first book and many fragments of the others. There are also extant numerous fragments of an ancient Syriac version of the work. It was written-or at least the third book was-while Eleutherus was bishop of Rome, i.e. between 174 and 189 (see Bk. III. chap. 3, §3, of the work itself). We are not able to fix the date of its compostion more exactly. The author's primary object was to refute Valentinianism (cf. Bk. I. <i>praef.,</i> and Bk. III. <i>praef.</i>), but in connection with that subject he takes occasion to say considerable about other related heresies. The sources of this great work have been carefully discussed by Lipsius, in his <i>Quellenkritik des Epiphanios,</i> and in his <i>Quellen der ältesten Ketzergeschichte,</i> and by Harnack in his <i>Quellenkritik der Geschichte des Gnosticismus</i> (see also the article by Lipsius mentioned below). Of the other works of Iren`us, many of which Eusebius refers to, only fragments or bare titles have been preserved. Whether he ever carried out his intention (stated in <i>Adv. Haer.</i> I. 27. 4, and III. 12. 12) of writing a special work against Marcion, we cannot tell. Eusebius mentions this intention in Bk. V. chap. 20; and in Bk. IV. chap. 25 he classes Irenaeus among the authors who had written against Marcion. But we hear nothing of the existence of the work from Irenaeus' successors, and it is possible that Eusebius is thinking in chap. 25 only of the great work <i>Adv. Haer.</i> For a notice of Irenaeus' epistle <i>On Schism,</i> addressed to Blastus, and the one <i>On Sovereignty,</i> addressed to Florinus, see Bk. V. chap. 20, notes 2 and 3; and on his treatise <i>On the Ogdoad,</i> see the same chapter, note 4. On his epistle to Victor in regard to the paschal dispute, see below, Bk. V. chap. 24, note 13. Other epistles upon the same subject are referred to by Eusebius at the close of the same chapter (see note 21 on that chapter). In Bk. V. chap. 26, Eusebius mentions four other works of Irenaeus (see notes on that chapter). In addition to the works referred to by Eusebius, there are extant a number of fragments which purport to be from other works of Irenaeus. Some of them are undoubtedly genuine, others not. Upon these fragments and the works to which they belong, see Harvey's edition of Irenaeus' works, II. p. 431 sq., and Lipsius in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> article Irenaeus, p. 265 sqq.</font></p>
<p>The best edition of Irenaeus' works is that of Harvey (Cambridge, 1857, in 2 vols.). In connection with this edition, see Loof's important article on <i>Irenaeushandschriften,</i> in <i>Kirchengeschichtliche Studien,</i> p. 1-93 (Leipzig, 1888). The literature on Irenaeus is very extensive (for a valuable list, see Schaff's <i>Ch. Hist.</i> II. 746), but a full and complete biography is greatly to be desired. Lipsius' article, referred to just above, is especially valuable.</p>

<sup>152 </sup>The five books of Hegesippus, <font face="SPIonic">upomnhmata</font><font> or <i>Memoirs,</i> are unfortunately lost; but a few fragments are preserved by Eusebius, and one by Photius, which have been collected by Routh, <i>Rel. Sac.</i> I. 205-219, and by Grabe, <i>Spicilegium,</i> II. 203-214. This work has procured for him from some sources the title of the "Father of Church History," but the title is misplaced, for the work appears to have been nothing more than a collection of reminiscences covering the apostolic and post-apostolic ages, and drawn partly from written, partly from oral sources, and in part from his own observation, and quite without chronological order and historical completeness. We know of no other works of his. Of Hegesippus himself we know very little. He apparently wrote his work during the episcopate of Eleutherus (175-189 a.d.), for he does not name his successor. How old he was at that time we do not know, but he was very likely a man past middle life, and hence was probably born early in the second century. With this, his own statement in the passage quoted by Eusebius, in chap. 8, that the deification of Antinoüs took place in his own day is quite consistent. The words of Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 22), who calls him a <i>vicinus apostolicorum temporum,</i> are too indefinite to give us any light, even if they rest upon any authority, as they probably do not. The journey which is mentioned in this chapter shows that his home must have been somewhere in the East, and there is no reason to doubt that he was a Hebrew Christian (see below, note 16).</font></p>
<p><a name="P2542_1201796"></a>
<sup>153 </sup>Of this Primus we know only what Hegesippus tells us here. We do not know the exact date of his episcopate, but it must have been at least in part synchronous with the episcopate of Plus of Rome (see chap. 11 note 14), for it was while Hegesippus was on his way to Rome that he saw Primus; and since he remained in Rome until the accession of Anicetus he must have arrived there while Pius, Anicetus' predecessor, was bishop, for having gone to Rome on a visit, he can hardly have remained there a number of years.</p>
<p><a name="P2544_1202550"></a>
<sup>154 </sup>The interpretation of this sentence is greatly disputed. The Greek reads in all the mss. <font face="SPIonic">genomenoj de en 'Rwmh diadoxhn epoihsamn mexrij 'Anikhtou</font><font>, and this reading is confirmed by the Syriac version (according to Lightfoot). If these words be accepted as authentic, the only possible rendering seems to be the one which has been adopted by many scholars: "Being in Rome, I composed a catalogue of bishops down to Anicetus." This rendering is adopted also by Lightfoot, who holds that the list of Hegesippus is reproduced by Epiphanius in his <i>Panarium</i> XXVII. 6 (see his essay in <i>The Academy,</i> May 27, 1887, where this theory is broached, and compare the writer's notice of it in Harnack's <i>Theol. Lit. Zeitung</i> 1887, No. 18). But against this rendering it must be said, first, that it is very difficult to translate the words </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn epoihsamhn</font><font>, "I composed a catalogue of bishops," for </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxh</font><font> nowhere else, so far as I am aware, means "catalogue," and nowhere else does the expression </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn poieisqai</font><font> occur. Just below, the same word signifies "succession," and this is its common meaning. Certainly, if Hegesippus wished to say that he had composed a catalogue of bishops, he could not have expressed himself more obscurely. In the second place, if Hegesippus had really composed a catalogue of bishops and referred to it here, how does it happen that Eusebius, who is so concerned to ascertain the succession of bishops in all the leading sees nowhere gives that catalogue, and nowhere even refers to it. He does give Irenaens' catalogue of the Roman bishops in Bk. V. chap. 6, but gives no hint there that he knows anything of a similar list composed by Hegesippus. In fact, it is very difficult to think that Hegesippus, in this passage, can have meant to say that he had composed a catalogue of bishops, and it is practically impossible to believe that Eusebius can have understood him to mean that.But the words </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn epoihsamhn</font><font>, if they can be made to mean anything at all, can certainly be made to mean nothing else than the composition of a catalogue, and hence it seems necessary to make some correction in the text. It is significant that Rufinus at this point reads <i>permansi ibi,</i> which shows that he at least did not understand Hegesippus to be speaking of a list of bishops. Rufinus' rendering gives us a hint of what must have stood in the original from which he drew, and so Savilius, upon the margin of his ms., substituted for </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn</font><font> the word </font><font face="SPIonic">diatribhn</font><font>, probably simply as a conjecture, but possibly upon the authority of some other ms. now lost. He has been followed by some editors, including Heinichen, who prints the word </font><font face="SPIonic">diatribhn</font><font> in the text. Val. retains </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn</font><font> in his text, but accepts </font><font face="SPIonic">diatribhn</font><font> as the true reading, and so translates. This reading is now very widely adopted; and it, or some other word with the same meaning, in all probability stood in the original text. In my notice of Lightfoot's article, I suggested the word </font><font face="SPIonic">diagwghn</font><font>, which, while not so common as </font><font face="SPIonic">diatribhn</font><font>, is yet used with </font><font face="SPIonic">poieisqai</font><font> in the same sense, and its very uncommonness would account more easily for the change to the much commoner </font><font face="SPIonic">diadoxhn</font><font>, which is epigraphically so like it.</font></p>
<p>The word <font face="SPIonic">mexri</font> is incorrectly translated <i>apud</i> by Valesius, who reads, <i>mansi apud Anicetum.</i> He is followed by Crusè, who translates "I made my stay with Anicetus"; but <font face="SPIonic">mexri</font> can mean only "until." Hegesippus therefore, according to his own statement, came to Rome before the accession of Anicetus and remained there until the latter became bishop. See chap. 11, note 19, for the relation of this statement to that of Eusebius.</p>
<p>For particulars in regard to Anicetus, see chap. 11, note 18; on Soter, see chap. 19, note 2, and on Eleutherus, Bk. V. Preface, note 2.</p>

<sup>156 </sup><font face="SPIonic">Dia touto</font><font>. Valesius proposes to read </font><font face="SPIonic">mexri toutou</font><font>, which certainly makes better sense and which finds some support in the statement made by Eusebius in Bk. III. chap. 32, §7. But all the mss. have </font><font face="SPIonic">dia touto</font><font>, and, as Stroth remarks, the illogical use of "therefore" at this point need not greatly surprise us in view of the general looseness of Hegesippus' style. The phrase is perhaps used proleptically, with a reference to what follows.</font></p>
<p><a name="P2549_1207462"></a>
<sup>157 </sup>Of Thebuthis we know only what is told us here. The statement that he became a heretic because he was not chosen bishop has about as much foundation as most reports of the kind. It was quite common for the Fathers to trace back the origin of schisms to this cause (compare e.g. <i>Tertullian's Adv. Val.</i> 4, and <i>De Bapt.</i> 17).</p>
<p><a name="P2550_1207884"></a>
<sup>158 </sup>The seven sects are mentioned by Hegesippus just below. Harnack maintains that Hegesippus in his treatment of heresies used two sources, one of them being the lost <i>Syntagma</i> of Justin (see his <i>Quellenkritik des Gnosticismus,</i> p. 37 sqq.). Lipsius, who in his <i>Quellen der Ketzergesch.</i> combats many of Harnack's positions, thinks it possible that Hegesippus <i>may</i> have had Justin's <i>Syntagma</i> before him.</p>
<p><a name="P2551_1208318"></a>
<sup>159 </sup>Simon Magus (see Bk. II. chap. 13, note 3).</p>
<p><a name="P2552_1208413"></a>
<sup>160 </sup>Cleobius is occasionally mentioned as a heretic by ecclesiastical writers, but none of them seems to know anything more about him than is told here by Hegesippus (see the article <i>Cleobius</i> in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i>).</p>
<p><a name="P2553_1208685"></a>
<sup>161 </sup>Trustworthy information in regard to Dositheus is very scanty, but it is probable that he was one of the numerous Samaritan false messiahs, and lived at about the time of, or possibly before, Christ. "It seems likely that the Dositheans were a Jewish or Samaritan ascetic sect, something akin to the Essenest existing from before our Lord's time, and that the stories connecting their founder with Simon Magus and with John the Baptist [see the <i>Clementine Recognitions,</i> II. 8 and <i>Homilies,</i> II. 24], may be dismissed as merely mythical" (Salmon, in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> art. <i>Dositheus</i>).</p>
<p><a name="P2554_1209330"></a>
<sup>162 </sup>Epiphanius and Theodoret also mention the Goratheni, but apparently knew no more about them than Hegesippus tells us here Epiphanius classing them among the Samaritans, and Theodoret deriving them from Simon Magus.</p>
<p><a name="P2555_1209598"></a>
<sup>163 </sup>The name Masbotheus us supported by no ms. Authority, but is given by Rufinus and by Nicephorus, and is adopted by most editors. The majority of the mss. read simply <font face="SPIonic">Masbwqaioi</font><font> or </font><font face="SPIonic">Masbwqeoi</font><font>. Just below, Hefessippus gives the Masbotheans as one of the seven Jewish sects, while here he says they were derived from them. This contradiction Harnack explains by Hegesippus' use of two different sources, an unknown oral or written one, and Justin's <i>Syntagma.</i> The list of heresies given here he maintains stood in Justin's <i>Syntagma,</i> but the derivation of them from the seven Jewish sects cannot have been Justin's work, nor can the list of the seven sects have been made by Justin, for he gives quite a different list in his <i>Dialogue,</i> chap. 80. Lipsius, p. 25, thinks the repetition of the "Masbotheans" is more easily explained as a mere oversight or accident. The <i>Apostolic Const.</i> VI. 6 name the Masbotheans among Jewish sects, describing them as follows: "The Basmotheans, who deny providence, and say that the world is ruled by spontaneous motion, and take away the immortality of the soul." From what source this description was taken we do not know, and cannot decide as to its reliability. Salmon (in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i>) remarks that "our real knowledge is limited to the occurrence of the name in Hegesippus, and there is no reason to think that any of these who have undertaken to explain it knew any more about the matter than ourselves."</font></p>

The latter is clearly epigraphically more correct, but the reasons for reading in this place Marcionites, or followers of Marcion, are strong enough to outweigh other considerations (see Harnack, p. 31 ff. and Lipsius, p. 29 ff.). </font></p>

<sup>166 </sup>These are the seven Jewish heresies mentioned above by Hegesippus. Justin (<i>Dial.</i> chap. 80) and Epiphanius (<i>Anaceph.</i>) also name seven Jewish sects, but they_ are not the same as those mentioned here (those of Justin: Sadducees, Genistae, Meristae, Galileans, Hellenianians, Pharisees, Baptists). Epiphanius (Vol. I. p. 230, Dindorf's ed.,-Samaritan sects 4: Gorothenes, <font face="SPIonic">Sebouaioi</font><font>, Essenes, Dositheans; Jewish 7: Scribes, Pharisees, Sadducees, Hemerobaptists, </font><font face="SPIonic">'Ossaioi</font><font>, Nazarenes, Herodians).

<sup>167 </sup>The exact meaning of this sentence is very difficult to determine. The Greek reads:<font face="SPIonic">ek te tou kaq 'Ebraiouj euaggeliou kai tou Suriakou kai idiwj ek thj 'Ebraidoj dialektou tina tiqhsin</font><font>. It is grammatically necessary to supply </font><font face="SPIonic">euaggeliou</font><font> after </font><font face="SPIonic">Suriakou</font><font>, and this gives us a Syriac gospelin addition to the Hebrew. Some have concluded that Tatian's <i>Diatessaron</i> is meant by it, but this will not do; for, as Handmann remarks, the fact that Hegesippus quotes from the work or works referred to is cited as evidence that he was a Hebrew. Hilgenfeld supposes that the <i>Chaldaeo syroque scriptum evangelium secundum Hebraeos,</i> which Jerome mentions, is referred to, and that the first-named </font><font face="SPIonic">euaggelion kaq 'Ebraiouj</font><font> is a Greek translation, while the </font><font face="SPIonic">to Suriakon</font><font> represents the original; so that Hegesippus is said to have used both the original and the translation. Eusebius, however, could not have made the discovery that he used both. unless the original and the translation differed in their contents, of which we have no hint, and which in itself is quite improbable. As the Greek reads, however, there is no other explanation possible, unless the </font><font face="SPIonic">to Suriakon euaggelion</font><font> be taken to represent some other unknown Hebrew gospel, in which case the following clause refers to the citations from both of the gospels. That such a gospel existed, however, and was referred to by Eusebius so casually, as if it were a well-known work, is not conceivable. The only resource left, so far as the writer can discover, is to antend the text, with Eichhorn, Nicholson, and Handmann, by striking out the first </font><font face="SPIonic">kai</font><font>. The </font><font face="SPIonic">tou Suriakou</font><font> then becomes a description of the </font><font face="SPIonic">euaggelion kaq 'Ebraiouj</font><font>, "The Syriac Gospel according to the Hebrews." By the Syriac we are to understand, of course, the vulgar dialect, which had before the time of Christ taken the place of the Hebrew, and which is ordinarily called Aramaic. Eusebius then, on this interpretation, first qualifies the Gospel of the Hebrews more exactly, and then adds that Hegesippus quotes from the Hebrew original of it (</font><font face="SPIonic">ek thj 'Ebraidoj dialektou</font><font>), and not from a translation; e.g. from the Greek translation, which we know existed early. There is, to be sure, no ms. authority for the alteration of the text, and yet the sefise of the passage seems to demand it, and I have consequently omitted the </font><font face="SPIonic">kai</font><font> in my translation. Upon the interpretation of the passage, see Handmann's <i>Hebräer-Evangelium,</i> p. 32 ff., and upon the Gospel according to the Hebrews, see above, Bk. III. chap. 25, note 24, and chap. 27, note 8.</font></p>

<sup>168 </sup>Eusebius had abundant opportunity to learn from Hegesippus<font face="SPIonic">0</font><font> works whether or not he was a Hebrew Christian, and hence we cannot doubt that his conclusion in regard to Hegesippus</font><font face="SPIonic">0</font><font> nationality (whether based merely upon the premises given here, or partly upon other facts unknown to us) is correct. His nationality explains the fact that he deduces the Christian heresies from Jewish, and not, like other writers, from heathen roots. There is, however, no reason, with Baur and others, to suppose that Hegesippus was a Judaizer. In fact, Eusebius' respectful treatment of him is in itself conclusive proof that his writings cannot have revealed heretical notions.</font></p>

<sup>169 </sup>This phrase (<font face="SPIonic">panaretoj sofia</font><font>) was very frequently employed among the Fathers as a title of the Book of Proverbs. Clement of Rome (1 Cor. lvii.) is, so far as I know, the first so to use it. The word </font><font face="SPIonic">panaretoj</font><font> is applied also to the apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, by Epiphanius (<i>de mens. et pond.</i> §4) and others. Among the Fathers the Book of Sirach, the Solomonic Apocrypha, and the Book of Proverbs all bore the common title </font><font face="SPIonic">sofia</font><font>, "Wisdom," which well defines the character of each of them; and this simple title is commoner than the compound phrase which occurs in this passage (cf. e.g. Justin Martyr's <i>Dial.</i> c. 129, and Melito, quoted by Eusebius in chap. 26, below). For further particulars, see especially Lightfoot's edition of the epistles of Clement of Rome, p. 164.</font></p>

<sup>170 </sup><font>Eusebius speaks, in this chapter, of seven Catholic epistles, and of one addressed to an individual. None of these epistles are now extant, though Eusebius here, and in Bk. II. chap. 25, gives us four brief but interesting fragments from the Epistle to the Romans. We know of the other epistles only what Eusebius tells us in this chapter. That Dionysius was held in high esteem as a writer of epistles to the churches is clear, not only from Eusebius' statement, but also from the fact that heretics thought it worth while to circulate interpolated and mutilated copies of them, as stated below. The fact that he wrote epistles to churches so widely scattered shows that he possessed an extended reputation.</font></p>
<p>Of Dionysius himself (who is, without foundation, called a martyr by the Greek Church, and a confessor by the Latin Church) we know only what we are told by Eusebius. for Jerome (<i>de vir ill.</i> 27) adds nothing to the account given in this chapter. In his <i>Chron.</i> Eusebius mentions Dionysius in connection with the eleventh year of Marcus Aurelius. According to Eusebius' statement in this same chapter, Dionysius' Epistle to the Romans was addressed to the bishop Soter, and as Eusebius had the epistle before him, there is no reason for doubting his report. Soter was bishop from about 167 to 175 (see above, chap. 19, note 4), and therefore the statements of the <i>Chron.</i> and the <i>History</i> are in accord. When Dionysius died we do not know, but he was no longer living in 199, for Bacchylus was bishop of Corinth at that time (see Bk. V. chap. 22). It is commonly said that Dionysius was the immediate successor of Primus, bishop of Corinth. This may be true, but we have no ground for the assumption. We know only that Primus' episcopate was synchronous, at least in part, with that of Pius of Rome (see the previous chapter, note 2), who was bishop from about 139 or 141 to 154 or 156, and that Dionysius' episcopate was synchronous at least an part with that of Soter of Rome (about 167 to 175).</p>

<sup>171 </sup>This is, so far as I am aware, the earliest mention of a church at Lacedaemon or Sparta. The bishop of Sparta is mentioned in the synodical letter of the province of Hellas to the emperor Leo (457-477 a.d.), and also still later in the Acts of the Sixth and Eighth General Synods, according to Wiltsch's <i>Geography and Statistics of the Church</i> (London ed. p. 134 and 466).</p>

<sup>172 </sup>Of this Publius we know only what Eusebius tells us here. What particular persecution is referred to we cannot tell, but Publius' martyrdom seems to have occurred in the reign of Antoninus Pius or Marcus Aurelius; for he was the immediate predecessor of Quadratus, who was apparently bishop at the time Dionysius was writing.</p>
<p><a name="P2573_1221255"></a>
<sup>173 </sup>We know nothing more about this Quadratus, for he is to be distinguished from the prophet and from the apologist (see chap. 3, note 2). Eusebius' words seem to imply that he was bishop at the time Dionysius was writing.</p>

<p><a name="P2577_1222042"></a>
<sup>176 </sup>The extent of Dionysius' influence is shown by his writing an epistle to so distant a church as that of Nicomedia in Bithynia, and also to the churches of Pontus (see below). The fact that he considers it necessary to attack Marcionism in this epistle to the Nicomedians is an indication of the wide and rapid spread of that sect,-which indeed is known to us from many sources.</p>
<p><a name="P2579_1222561"></a>
<sup>177 </sup>Gortyna was an important city in Crete, which was early the seat of a bishop. Tradition, indeed, makes Titus the first bishop of the church there.</p>
<p><a name="P2580_1222791"></a>
<sup>178 </sup>Of this Philip, bishop of Gortyna, and a contemporary of Dionysius, we know only what Eusebius tells us here and in chap. 25.</p>
<p><a name="P2582_1223151"></a>
<sup>179 </sup>Amastris was a city of Pontus, which is here mentioned for the first time as the seat of a Christian church. Its bishop is referred to frequently in the Acts of Councils during the next few centuries (see also note 12, below).</p>
<p><a name="P2583_1223441"></a>
<sup>180 </sup>This Bacchylides is perhaps identical with the Bacchylus who was afterward bishop of Corinth (Bk. V. chap. 22). Elpistus is another,vise unknown personage.</p>
<p><a name="P2584_1223744"></a>
<sup>181 </sup>This Palmas, bishop of Amastris in Pontus, presided as senior bishop over a council of the bishops of Pontus held toward the close of the century on the paschal question (see Bk. V. chap. 23). Nothing more is known of him.</p>

<sup>182 </sup>It is quite likely, as Salmon suggests (in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i>), that Dionysius, who wrote against Marcion in this epistle to the Nicomedians, also had Marcionism in view in writing on life and discipline to the churches of Pontus and Crete. It was probably in consequence of reaction against their strict discipline that he advo-cated the readmission to the Church of excommunicated offenders, in this anticipating the later practice of the Roman church, which was introduced by Callixtus and soon afterward became general, though not without bitter opposition from many quarters. Harnack (<i>Dogmengeschichte,</i> p. 332, note 4) throws doubt upon the correct-ness of this report of Eusebius; but such doubt is unwarranted, for Eusebius had Dionysius' epistle before him, and the position which he represents him as taking is quite in accord with the mildness which he recommends to Pinytus, and is therefore just what we should expect. The fact that Callixtusf principle is looked upon by Terttulian and Hippolytus as an innovation does not militate at all against the possibility that Dionysius in Corinth, or other individuals in other minor churches, held the same principles some time before.</p>
<p><a name="P2587_1225439"></a>
<sup>183 </sup>Cnossus, or Cnos, was the capital city of Crete.</p>
<p>This epistle is no longer extant, nor do we know anythong about Pinytus himself except what is told us here and in chap. 21, above, where he is mentioned among the ecclesiastical writers of the day. Jerome (<i>de vir. ill. 28</i>) only repeats what Eusebius says, and Ruffnus, in stating that Pinytus was convinced by the epistle of Dionysius and changed his course, seems simply to have misunderstood what Eusebius says about his admiration for and praise of Dionysius. It is evident from the tone of his reply that Pinytus was not led by Dionysius' epistle to agree with him.</p>
<p><a name="P2590_1226901"></a>
<sup>184 </sup>On Soter, see chap. 19, note 2.</p>
<p>This practice of the Roman church combined with other causes to secure it that position of influence and prominence which resulted in the primacy of its bishop, and finally in the papacy. The position of the Roman church, as well as its prosperity and numerical strength, gave it early a feeling that it was called upon in an especial way to exercise oversight and to care for weaker sister churches, and thus its own good offices helped to promote its influence and its power.</p>

<sup>188 </sup>A probable, though not exclusive, reference to Marcion, for he was by no means the only one of that age that interpolated and mutilated the works of the apostles to fit his theories. Apostolic works true and false-circulated in great numbers, and were made the basis for the speculations and moral requirements of many of the heretical schools of the second century.</p>
