<sup>10 </sup>The remainder of this extract from Sophronius is a translation of the chapter of Jerome's <i>de viris illustribus,</i> which is quoted above, on p. 60, and is therefore omitted at this point. Valesius adds some extracts from Baronius and Scaliger; but inasmuch as they are to be classed with modern rather than with ancient writers, it has seemed best to omit the quotations from their works. </p>

<sup>2 </sup>Greek <font face="SPIonic">oikonomia</font><font>. Suicer (<i>Thesaurus Eccles.</i>) points out four uses of this word among ecclesiastical writers: (1) <i>Ministerium, Evangelii.</i> (2) <i>Providentia et numen</i> (i.e. of God). (3) <i>Naturae humanae assumtio.</i> (4) <i>Totius redemptionis mysterium et passionis Christi sacramentum.</i> Valesius says, "The ancient Greeks use the word to denote whatever Christ did in the world to proclaim salvation for the human race, and thus the first </font><font face="SPIonic">oikonomia triu xristu</font><font> is the incarnation, as the last </font><font face="SPIonic">oikonomia</font><font> is the passion." The word in the present case is used in its wide sense to denote not simply the act of incarnation, but the whole economy or dispensation of Christ upon earth. See the notes of Heinichen upon this passage, Vol. III. p. 4 sq., and of Valesius, Vol. I. p. 2.</font></p>

Closs translates <i>die Nachsicht der Kenner;</i> Stigloher, <i>wohlwollende Nachsicht.</i> Crusè avoids the difficulty by omitting the word; an omission which is quite unwarranted.</font></p>

<sup>5 </sup>Eusebius is rightly called the "Father of Church History." He had no predecessors who wrote, as be did, with a comprehensive historical plan in view; and yet, as he tells us, much had been written of which he made good use in his History. The one who approached nearest to the idea of a Church historian was Hegesippus (see Bk. IV. chap. 22, note 1), but his writings were little more than fragmentary memoirs, or collections of disconnected reminiscences. For instance, Eusebius, in Bk. II. chap 23, quotes from his fifth and last book the account of the martyrdom of James the Just, which shows that his work lacked at least all chronological arrangement. Julius Africanus (see Bk. VI. chap. 31, note 1) also furnished Eusebius with much material in the line of chronology, and in his Chronicle Eusebius made free use of him. These are the only two who can in any sense be said to have preceded Eusebius in his province, and neither one can rob him of his right to be called the "Father of Church History."</p>
<p><a name="P535_311633"></a>
<sup>6 </sup>One of the greatest values of Eusebius' History lies in the quotations which it contains from earlier ecclesiastical writers. The works of many of them are lost, and are known to us only through the extracts made by Eusebius. This fact alone is enough to make his History of inestimable worth. </p>

<sup>9 </sup><font face="SPIonic">qeologia</font><font>. Suicer gives four meanings for this word: (1) <i>Doctrina de Deo.</i> (2) <i>Doctrina de SS. Trinitate.</i> (3) <i>Divina Christi natura, seu doctrina de ea.</i> (4) <i>Scriptura sacra utriusque Testamenti.</i> The word is used here in its third signification (cf. also chap. 2, §3, and Bk. V. chap. 28, §5). It occurs very frequently in the works of the Fathers with this meaning, especially in connection with </font><font face="SPIonic">oikonomia</font><font>, which is then quite commonly used to denote the "human nature" of Christ. In the present chapter </font><font face="SPIonic">oikonomia</font><font> keeps throughout its more general signification of "the Dispensation of Christ," and is not confined to the mere act of incarnation, nor to his "human nature."</font></p>

<sup>11 </sup>This was one of the principal objections raised against Christianity. Antiquity was considered a prime requisite in a religion which claimed to be true, and no reproach was greater than the reproach of novelty. Hence the apologists laid great stress upon the antiquity of Christianity, and this was one reason why they appropriated the Old Testament as a Christian book. Compare, for instance, the apologies of Justin Martyr, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Tertullian and Minucius Felix, and the works of l Clement of Alexandria. See Engelhardt's article on Eusebius, in the <i>Zeitschrift für die hist. Theologie</i>, 1852, p. 652 sq.; Schaff's <i>Church History</i>, Vol. II. p. 110; and Tzschirner's <i>Geschichte der Apologetik</i>, p. 99 sq.</p>

<sup>17 </sup>Ps. xxxiii. 9. There is really nothing in this passage to imply that the Psalmist thinks, as Eusebius supposes, of the Son as the Father's agent in creation, who is here addressed by the Father. As Stroth remarks, "According to Eusebius, `He spake0' is equivalent to `He said to the Son, Create0'; and `They were created0' means, according to him, not `They arose immediately upon this command of God,0' but `The Son was immediately obedient to the command of the Father and produced them.0' For Eusebius connects this verse with the sixth, `By the <i>word</i> of the Lord were the heavens made,0' where he understands Christ to be referred to. Perhaps this verse has been omitted in the Greek through an over- sight for it is found in Rufinus." </p>

<sup>20 </sup>Eusebius accepts the common view of the early Church, that the theophanies of the Old Testament were Christophanies; that is, appearances of the second person of the Trinity. Augustine seems to have been the first of the Fathers to take a different view, main- taining that such Christophanies were not consistent with the identity of essence between Father and Son, and that the Scriptures themselves teach that it was not the Logos, but an angel, that appeared to the Old Testament worthies on various occasions (cf. <i>De Trin.</i> III. 11). Augustine's opinion was widely adopted, but in modern times the earlier view, which Eusebius represents, has been the prevailing one (see Hodge, <i>Systematic Theology</i>, I. p. 490, and Lange's article <i>Theaphany</i> in Herzog).</p>

<sup>26 </sup>The mss. differ greatly at this point. A number of them followed by Valesius, Closs, and Crusè, read, <font face="SPIonic">wsanei tou patroj uparxonta dunamin kai sofian</font><font>. Schwegler, Laemmer, Burton, and Heinichen adopt another reading which has some ms. support, and which we have followed in our translation: </font><font face="SPIonic">wsanei tou patroj uparxon</font><font>.

<sup>29 </sup>Eusebius agrees with other earlier Fathers (e.g. Justin Martyr, Origen, and Cyprian) in identifying the one that appeared to Joshua with him that had appeared to Moses, on the ground that the same words were used in both cases (cf. especially Justin's <i>Dial. c. Trypho</i>, chap. 62). Many later Fathers (e.g. Theodoret) regard the person that appeared to Joshua as the archangel Michael, who is described by Daniel (x. 21 and xii. 1) as fighting for the people of God. See Keil's <i>Commentary on Joshua,</i> chap. 5, vv. 13-15.</p>

<sup>35 </sup>Eusebius pursues much the same line of argument in his <i>Dem. Evang</i>., Proem. Bk. VIII.; and compare also Gregory of Nyssa's Third Oration on the birth of the Lord (at the beginning). The objection which Eusebius undertakes to answer here was an old one, and had been considered by Justin Martyr, by Origen in his work against Celsus, and by others (see Tzschirner's <i>Geschichte der Apologetik,</i> p. 25 ff.).</p>
<p><a name="P590_327693"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>The reference here seems to be to the building of the tower of Babel (Gen. xi. 1-9), although Valesius thinks otherwise. The fact that Eusebius refers to the battles of the giants, which were celebrated in heathen song, does not militate against a reference in this passage to the narrative recounted in Genesis. He illustrates the presumption of the human race by instances familiar to his readers whether drawn from Christian or from Pagan sources. Compare the <i>Praep. Evang</i>. ix. 14.</p>
<p><a name="P595_329953"></a>
<sup>37 </sup>It was the opinion of Eusebius, in common with most of the Fathers, that the Greek philosophers, lawgivers, and poets had obtained their wisdom from the ancient Hebrews, and this point was pressed very strongly by many of the apologists in their effort to prove the antiquity of Christianity. The assertion was made especially in the case of Plato and Pythagoras, who were said to have become acquainted with the books of the Hebrews upon their journey to Egypt. Compare among other passages Justin's Apol. I. 59 ff.; Clement of Alexandria's <i>Cohort. ad Gentes</i>, chap. 6; and Tertullian's <i>Apol.</i> chap. 47. Compare also Eusebius' <i>Praep. Evang.,</i> Bks. IX. and X. </p>
<p><a name="P597_331640"></a>
<sup>38 </sup>The Greek has only <font face="SPIonic">epi telei</font><font>, which can refer, however, only to the end of time or to the end of the world.</font></p>
