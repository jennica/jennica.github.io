<sup>6 </sup><font>The following <i>Testimonies of the Ancients</i> were collected by Valesius, and are printed in the original languages in his edition of Eusebius' <i>Historia Ecclesiastica,</i> at the close of his <i>Vita Eusebii.</i> The order of Valesius has been preserved in the following pages, but occasionally a passage, for the sake of greater clearness, has been given more fully than by him. A few extracts have been omitted (as noted below), and one or two, overlooked by him, have been added. The extracts have all been translated from the original for this edition, with the exception of the quotations from the <i>Life of Constantine,</i> and from the Greek Ecclesiastical Historians,-Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Evagrius,-which have been copied, with a few necessary corrections, from the version found in Bagster's edition of the <i>Greek Ecclesiastical Historians.</i> The translation has been made at my request by Mr. James McDonald, of Shelbyville, Ky., a member of the senior class (1890) of Lane Theological Seminary. </font></p>
