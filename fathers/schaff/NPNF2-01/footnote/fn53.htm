<sup>180 </sup>This is a glaring instance of uncritical credulity on Eusebius' part, and yet even Crusè can say: "Perhaps some might smile at the supposed credulity of our author, but the <i>miracle</i> in this account was not greater than the <i>malignity,</i> and if man can perform miracles of vice, we can scarcely wonder if Providence should present, at least, miracles of admonition." Cureton more sensibly remarks: "This, which doubtless was produced by natural causes, seemed miraculous to Eusebius, more especially if he looked upon it as fulfilling a prophecy of our Lord-Luke xix. 40: `I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.0' See also Hab. ii. 11."</p>

<sup>182 </sup>The majority of the codices read <font face="SPIonic">Promoj</font><font>, but as Valesius remarks, such a proper name is quite unknown in Greek, and the form probably arose from a confusion of </font><font face="SPIonic">b</font><font> and </font><font face="SPIonic">m</font><font>, which in ancient mss. were written alike. Two of our existing codices read </font><font face="SPIonic">Proboj</font><font>, and this has been adopted by Zimmermann and Heinichen, whom I have followed in the text.</font></p>

<p><a name="P5330_2431364"></a>
<sup>192 </sup>i.e Feb. 19 (see the table on p. 403, below). We learn from chap. 7, §§3-5, that Pamphilus was thrown into prison in the fifth year of the persecution and as late as November of that year, i.e. between November, 307, and April, 308. Since he had lain two whole years in prison (according to §5, above), the date referred to in the present passage must be February of the year 310. The martyrdom of Pamphilus is commonly, for aught I know to the contrary, uniformly put in the year 309, as the seventh year of the persecution is nearly synchronous with that year. But that the common date is a mistake is plain enough from the present chapter.</p>

<sup>196 </sup>The reference is still to the same slave of Pamphilus whose tortures Eusebius has just been describing, as we learn from the Syriac version, where the slave's name is given at the beginning of the account.</p>

<sup>197 </sup>I read <font face="SPIonic">peri auton</font><font> with Zimmermann, Heinichen, Burton, and Migne. The mss. all have </font><font face="SPIonic">peri autouj</font><font>, which can hardly have stood in the original.</font></p>

<sup>199 </sup>Of the so-called country of <font face="SPIonic">Magganaia</font><font> I know nothing. The Syriac version reads Batanea, which was a district of country lying to the northeast of Palestine, and it may be that Manganea was another name for the same region.</font></p>

<sup>201 </sup>It was the universal custom in ancient times for a city to have its special tutelary divinity, to which it looked for protection and to which it paid especial honor. The name of the Caesarean deity is unknown to us.</p>

<sup>203 </sup>"It was a punishment among the Romans that freemen should be condemned to take care of the emperor's horses or camels, and to perform other personal offices of that kind" (Valesius). For fuller particulars, see Valesius' note <i>ad locum.</i> In the <i>Acts of St. Marcellus</i> (who was bishop of Rome) we are told that he was set by Maximian to groom his horses in a church which the emperor had turned into a stable.</p>

<sup>214 </sup>On the division of the empire to which Eusebius here refers; see above, Bk. VIII. chap. 13, note 17.</p>

<p><a name="P5397_2452811"></a>
<sup>216 </sup>It would seem that the edict was originally appended to this shorter recension of the martyrs (the longer recension is complete in its present form, and contains no hint of such an addition). Very likely it was dropped with the second half of the work (see above, p. 29) as unnecessary, when the first half was inserted in the <i>History.</i> The edict is given in full in Bk. VIII. chap. 17, above.</p>
