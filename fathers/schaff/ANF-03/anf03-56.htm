<font size="3">Chapter I.-Of Patience Generally; And Tertullian's Own Unworthiness to Treat of It.</font></p>
</ul><p>I Fully confess unto the Lord God that it has been rash enough, if not even impudent, in <i>me</i> to have dared compose a treatise on Patience, for <i>practising</i> which I am all unfit, being a man of no goodness;<sup><a href="footnote/fn121.htm#P12196_3412868" id="P12196_3412868" name="P12196_3412868">2</a></sup> whereas it were becoming that such as have addressed themselves to the demonstration and commendation of some particular thing, should themselves first be conspicuous in the practice of that thing, and should regulate the constancy of their commonishing by the authority of their personal conduct, for fear their words blush at the deficiency of their deeds. And would that this "blushing" would bring a remedy, so that shame for <i>not</i> exhibiting that which we go to suggest to others should prove a tutorship into exhibiting it; except that the magnitude of some good things-just as of some ills too-is insupportable, so that only the grace of divine inspiration is effectual for attaining and practising them. For what is <i>most</i> good rests <i>most</i> with God; nor does any other than He who possesses it dispense it, as He deems meet to each. And so to discuss about that which it is not given one to enjoy, will be, as it were, a solace; after the manner of invalids, who since they are without health, know not how to be silent about its blessings. So I, most miserable, ever sick with the heats of <i>im</i>patience, must of necessity sigh after, and invoke, and persistently plead for, that health of patience which I possess not; while I recall to mind, and, in the contemplation of my own weakness, digest, <i>the truth</i>, that the good health of faith, and the soundness of the Lord's discipline, accrue not easily to any unless patience sit by his side.<sup><a href="footnote/fn121.htm#P12197_3414352" id="P12197_3414352" name="P12197_3414352">3</a></sup> So is patience set over the things of God, that one can obey no precept, fulfil no work well-pleasing to the Lord, if estranged from it. The good of it, even they who live outside it,<sup><a href="footnote/fn121.htm#P12198_3414556" id="P12198_3414556" name="P12198_3414556">4</a></sup> honour with the name of highest virtue. Philosophers indeed, who are accounted animals of some considerable wisdom, assign it so high a place, that, while they are mutually at discord with the various fancies of their sects and rivalries of their sentiments, yet, having a community of regard for patience alone, to this one of their pursuits they have joined in granting peace: for it they conspire; for it they league; it, in their affectation of<sup><a href="footnote/fn121.htm#P12199_3415038" id="P12199_3415038" name="P12199_3415038">5</a></sup> virtue, they unanimously pursue; concerning patience they exhibit all their ostentation of wisdom. Grand testimony this is to it, in that it incites even the vain schools of the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12200_3415247" id="P12200_3415247" name="P12200_3415247">6</a></sup> unto praise and glory! Or is it rather an injury, in that a thing divine is bandied among worldly sciences? But let them look to that, who shall presently be ashamed of their wisdom, destroyed and disgraced together with the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12201_3415507" id="P12201_3415507" name="P12201_3415507">7</a></sup> (it lives in).</p>

God suffers Himself to be conceived in a mother's womb, and awaits <i>the time for birth</i>; and, when born, bears <i>the delay</i> of growing up; and, when grown up, is not eager to be recognised, but is furthermore contumelious to Himself, and is baptized by His own servant; and repels with words alone the assaults of the tempter; while from being" Lord" He becomes" Master," teaching man to escape death, having been trained to the exercise of the absolute forbearance of offended patience.<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12216_3417786" id="P12216_3417786" name="P12216_3417786">16</a></sup> He did not strive; He did not cry aloud; nor did any hear His voice in the streets. He did not break the bruised reed; the smoking flax He did not quench: for the prophet-nay, the attestation of God Himself, placing His own Spirit, together with patience in its entirety, in His Son-had not falsely spoken. There was none desirous of cleaving to Him whom He did not receive. No one's table or roof did He despise: indeed, Himself ministered to the washing of the disciples' feet; not sinners, not publicans, did He repel; not with that city even which had refused to receive Him was He wroth,<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12217_3418535" id="P12217_3418535" name="P12217_3418535">17</a></sup> when even the disciples had wished that the celestial fires should be forthwith hurled on so contumelious a town. He cared for the ungrateful; He yielded to His ensnarers. This were a small matter, if He had not had in His company even His own betrayer, and stedfastly abstained from pointing him out. Moreover, while He is being betrayed, while He is being led up "as a sheep for a victim," (for "so He no more opens His mouth than a lamb under the power of the shearer,")He to whom, had He willed it, legions of angels would at one word have presented themselves from the heavens, approved not the avenging sword of even one disciple The patience of the Lord was wounded in (the wound of) Malchus. And so, too, He cursed for the time to come the works of the sword; and, by the restoration of health, made satisfaction to him whom Himself had not hurt, through Patience, the mother of Mercy. I pass by in silence (the fact) that He is crucified, for this was the end for which He had come; yet had the death which must be undergone need of contumelies likewise?<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12218_3419620" id="P12218_3419620" name="P12218_3419620">18</a></sup> <i>Nay</i>, but, when about to depart, He wished to be sated with the pleasure of patience. He is spitted on, scourged, derided, clad foully, more foully crowned. Wondrous is the faith of equanimity! He who had set before <i>Him</i> the concealing of Himself in man's shape, imitated nought of man's impatience! Hence, even more than from any other trait, ought ye, Pharisees, to have recognised the Lord. Patience of this kind none of <i>men</i> would achieve. Such and so mighty evidences-the <i>very</i> magnitude of which proves to be among the nations indeed a cause for rejection of the faith, but among us its reason and rearing-proves manifestly enough (not by the sermons only, in enjoining, but likewise by the sufferings of the Lord in enduring) to them to whom it is given to believe, that as the effect and excellence of some inherent propriety, patience is God's nature.</p>

For you will throw more light on what is to be pursued, if you first give a digest of what is to be avoided.</p>
<p>Let us therefore consider, concerning <i>Im</i>patience, whether just as patience in God, so its adversary quality have been born and detected in our adversary, that from this consideration may appear how primarily adverse it is to faith. For that which has been conceived by God's rival, of course is not friendly to God's things. The discord of <i>things</i> is the same as the discord of their <i>authors</i>. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary worst, <i>of beings</i>, by their own very diversity they testify that neither works for<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12245_3425434" id="P12245_3425434" name="P12245_3425434">38</a></sup> the other; so that anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the Evil One, than anything of evil by the Good. Therefore I detect the nativity of impatience in the devil himself, at that very time when he impatiently bore that the Lord God subjected the universal works which He had made to His own image, that is, to man.<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12246_3425876" id="P12246_3425876" name="P12246_3425876">39</a></sup> For if he had endured (that), he would not have grieved; nor would he have envied man if he had not grieved. Accordingly he deceived him, because he had envied him; but he had envied because he had grieved: he had grieved because, of course, he had not patiently borne. What that angel of perdition<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12247_3426199" id="P12247_3426199" name="P12247_3426199">40</a></sup> first was-malicious or impatient-I scorn to inquire: since manifest it is that either impatience took its rise <i>together with</i> malice, or else malice <i>from</i> impatience; that subsequently they conspired between themselves; and that they grew up indivisible in one paternal bosom. But, however, having been instructed, by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was that which he had been the first to feel, and by means of which he had entered on his course of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting of man into crime. The woman,<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12248_3426916" id="P12248_3426916" name="P12248_3426916">41</a></sup> immediately on being met by him-I may say so without rashness-was, through his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with impatience: so certain is it that she would never have sinned at all, if she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining her patience to the end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her his ears,<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12249_3427387" id="P12249_3427387" name="P12249_3427387">42</a></sup> she is impatient of keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had imbibed from the Evil One? Therefore another human being, too, perishes through the impatience of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself, through his own impatience committed in each respect, both in regard of God's premonition and in regard of the devil's cheatery; not enduring to observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin) of delinquency, arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man was induced to offend, God began to be wroth. Whence (came)the first indignation in God, thence (came) His first patience; who, content at that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil's case from the instant infliction<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12250_3428185" id="P12250_3428185" name="P12250_3428185">43</a></sup> of punishment.

For straightway that <i>impatience</i> conceived of the devil's seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought forth, trained him in her own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve in death, taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to ascribe this to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first fratricide, had borne with equanimity and not impatiently the refusal by the Lord of his own oblations-if he is not wroth with his own brother-if, finally, he took away no one's life. Since, then, he could neither have killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless he had been impatient, he demonstrates that what he did through wrath must be referred to that by which wrath was suggested during this cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy.

</ul><p>Now, however, while we run through the causes of impatience, all the other precepts also will answer in their own places. If our spirit is aroused by the loss of property, it is commonished by the Lord's Scriptures, in almost every place, to a contemning of the world;<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12284_3435965" id="P12284_3435965" name="P12284_3435965">71</a></sup> nor is there any more powerful exhortation to contempt of money submitted<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12285_3436053" id="P12285_3436053" name="P12285_3436053">72</a></sup> (to us), than (<i>the fact</i>) the Lord Himself is found amid no riches. He always justifies the poor, fore-condemns the rich. So He fore-ministered to patience "loss," and to opulence "contempt" (as portion);<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12286_3436272" id="P12286_3436272" name="P12286_3436272">73</a></sup> demonstrating, by means of (His own) <i>repudiation</i> of riches, that <i>hurts</i> done to them also are not to be much regarded. Of that, therefore, which we have not the smallest need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we ought to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. "Covetousness," the Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle pronounced "a root of all evils."<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12287_3436829" id="P12287_3436829" name="P12287_3436829">74</a></sup> Let us not interpret that <i>covetousness</i> as consisting merely in the concupiscence of what is another's: for even what <i>seems</i> ours <i>is</i> another's; for nothing is ours, since all things are God's, whose are we also ourselves. And so, if, when suffering from a loss, we feel impatiently, grieving for what is lost from what is not our own, we shall be detected as bordering on covetousness: we <i>seek</i> what is another's when we ill brook <i>losing</i> what is another's. He who is greatly stirred with impatience of a loss, does, by giving things earthly the precedence over things heavenly, sin directly<sup><a href="footnote/fn122.htm#P12288_3437463" id="P12288_3437463" name="P12288_3437463">75</a></sup> against God; for the Spirit, which he has received from the Lord, he greatly shocks for the sake of a worldly matter.

In truth, I know not whether he who has not made up his mind to endure with constancy the loss of somewhat of his, either by theft, or else by force, or else even by carelessness, would himself readily or heartily lay hand on his own property in the cause of almsgiving: for who that endures not at all to be cut by another, himself draws the sword on his own body?

But us, according to the diversity by which we are distinguished from them, it becomes to lay down not our soul for money, but money for our soul, whether spontaneously in bestowing or patiently in losing.</p>

For it will wholly fall then and there with bootless and fruitless labour; and sometimes will recoil and spend its rage on him who sent it out, with retorted impetus. No doubt the reason why any one hurts you is that you may be pained; because the hurter's enjoyment consists in the pain of the hurt. When, then, you have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, <i>he</i> must needs he pained by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go unhurt away, which even alone is enough for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary's disappointment, and revenged by his pain.

Since, then, there is certainty as to the resurrection of the dead, grief for death is needless, and impatience of grief is needless. For why should you grieve, if you believe that (your loved one) is not perished? Why should you bear impatiently the temporary withdrawal of him who you believe will return? That which you think to be death is departure.

For why should you bear without moderation <i>the fact that</i> one is gone away whom you will presently follow? Besides, impatience in matters of this kind bodes ill for our hope, and is a dealing insincerely with the faith. And we wound Christ when we accept not with equanimity the summoning out of this world of any by Him, as if they were to be pitied.

</ul><p>After these principal material causes of impatience, registered to the best of our ability, why should we wander out of our way among the rest,-what are found at home, what abroad? Wide and diffusive is the Evil One's operation, hurling manifold irritations of our spirit, and sometimes trifling ones, sometimes very great. But the trifling ones you may contemn from their very littleness; to the very great ones you may yield in regard of their overpoweringness. Where the injury is less, there is no necessity for impatience; but where the injury is greater, there more necessary is the remedy for the injury-patience. Let us strive, therefore, to endure the inflictions of the Evil One, that the counter-zeal of our equanimity may mock the zeal of the foe. If, however, we ourselves, either by imprudence or else voluntarily, draw upon ourselves anything, let us meet with equal patience what we have to blame ourselves for. Moreover, if we believe that some inflictions are sent on us by the Lord, to whom should we more exhibit patience than to the Lord? Nay, He teaches<sup><a href="footnote/fn123.htm#P12336_3449769" id="P12336_3449769" name="P12336_3449769">111</a></sup> us to give thanks and rejoice, over and above, at being thought worthy of divine chastisement.

Of that duty great is the reward-namely, happiness. For whom but the patient has the Lord called happy, in saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens?

Her countenance is tranquil and peaceful; her brow serene<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12402_3464307" id="P12402_3464307" name="P12402_3464307">165</a></sup> contracted by no wrinkle of sadness or of anger; her eyebrows evenly relaxed in gladsome wise, with eyes downcast in humility, not in unhappiness; her mouth sealed with the honourable mark of silence; her hue such as theirs who are without care and without guilt; the motion of her head frequent against the devil, and her laugh threatening;<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12403_3464681" id="P12403_3464681" name="P12403_3464681">166</a></sup> her clothing, moreover, about her bosom white and well fitted to her person, as being neither inflated nor disturbed. For <i>Patience</i> sits on the throne of that calmest and gentlest Spirit, who is not found in the roll of the whirlwind, nor in the leaden hue of the cloud but is of soft serenity, open and simple, whom Elias saw at his third essay.<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12404_3465087" id="P12404_3465087" name="P12404_3465087">167</a></sup> For where God is, there too is His foster-child, namely Patience. When God's Spirit descends, then Patience accompanies Him indivisibly. If we do not give admission <i>to her</i> together with the Spirit, will (He) <i>always</i> tarry with us? Nay, I know not whether He would remain <i>any longer</i>. Without His companion and handmaid, He must of necessity be straitened in every place and at every time. Whatever blow His enemy may inflict He will be unable to endure alone, being without the instrumental means of enduring.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XVI.-The Patience of the Heathen Very Different from Christian Patience. Theirs Doomed to Perdition. Ours Destined to Salvation.</font></p>
</ul><p>This is the rule, this the discipline, these the works of patience <i>which is</i> heavenly and true; that is, of Christian <i>patience</i>, not false and disgraceful, like as is that patience of the nations of the earth. For in order that in this also the devil might rival the Lord, he has as it were quite on a par (except that the very diversity of evil and good is exactly on a par with their magnitude<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12408_3466455" id="P12408_3466455" name="P12408_3466455">168</a></sup> ) taught <i>his disciples</i> also a patience of his own; that, I mean, which, making husbands venal for dowry, and teaching them to trade in panderings, makes them subject to the power of their wives; which, with feigned affection, undergoes. every toil of forced complaisance,<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12409_3466769" id="P12409_3466769" name="P12409_3466769">169</a></sup> with a view to ensnaring the childless;<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12410_3466826" id="P12410_3466826" name="P12410_3466826">170</a></sup> which makes the slaves of the belly<sup><a href="footnote/fn124.htm#P12411_3466909" id="P12411_3466909" name="P12411_3466909">171</a></sup> submit to contumelious patronage, in the subjection of their liberty to their gullet. Such pursuits of patience the Gentiles are acquainted with; and they eagerly seize a name of so great goodness to apply it to foul practises: patient they live of rivals, and of the rich, and of such as give them invitations; impatient of God alone. But let their own and their leader's patience look to itself-<i>a patience</i> which the subterraneous fire awaits!Let us, on the other hand, love the patience of God, the patience of Christ; let us repay to Him the <i>patience</i> which He has paid down for us! Let us offer <i>to Him</i> the patience of the spirit, the patience of the flesh, believing as we do in the resurrection of flesh and spirit.</p>
