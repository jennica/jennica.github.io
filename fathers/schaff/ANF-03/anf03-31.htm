<p><i>Which Tertullian pursues his argument. Jesus is the Christ of the creator. He derives his proofs from St. Luke's gospel; that being the only historical portion of the New Testament partially accepted by Marcion. This book may also be regarded as a commentary on St. Luke. It gives remarkable proof of Tertullian's grasp of scripture, and proves that "The old testament is not contrary to the new." It also abounds in striking expositions of scriptural passages, embracing profound views of revelation, in connection with the nature of man.</i></p>

<font size="3">Chapter I.-Examination of the Antitheses of Marcion, Bringing Them to the Test of Marcion's Own Gospel. Certain True Antitheses in the Dispensations of the Old and the New Testaments.these Variations Quite Compatible with One and the Same God, Who Ordered Them.</font></p>
</ul><p>Every opinion and the whole scheme<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5236_1637756" id="P5236_1637756" name="P5236_1637756">2</a></sup> of the impious and sacrilegious Marcion we now bring to the test<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5237_1637835" id="P5237_1637835" name="P5237_1637835">3</a></sup> of that very Gospel which, by his process of interpolation, he has made his own. To encourage a belief <i>of this Gospel</i> he has actually<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5238_1638178" id="P5238_1638178" name="P5238_1638178">4</a></sup> devised for it a sort of dower,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5239_1638227" id="P5239_1638227" name="P5239_1638227">5</a></sup> in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled <i>Antitheses</i>, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods-one for each Instrument, or Testament<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5240_1638500" id="P5240_1638500" name="P5240_1638500">6</a></sup> as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5241_1638600" id="P5241_1638600" name="P5241_1638600">7</a></sup> belief in "the Gospel according to the Antitheses." These, however, I would have attacked in special combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices Of the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once with a peremptory demurrer,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5242_1639025" id="P5242_1639025" name="P5242_1639025">8</a></sup> yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we have now drawn out some <i>antitheses</i> of our own in opposition to Marcion.And indeed<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5243_1639576" id="P5243_1639576" name="P5243_1639576">9</a></sup> I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5244_1639680" id="P5244_1639680" name="P5244_1639680">10</a></sup> and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5245_1640028" id="P5245_1640028" name="P5245_1640028">11</a></sup> did Isaiah declare that "out of Sion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5246_1640142" id="P5246_1640142" name="P5246_1640142">12</a></sup> -some other law, that is, and another word. In short, says he, "He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5247_1640289" id="P5247_1640289" name="P5247_1640289">13</a></sup> meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, "they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instruments) into pruning-hooks; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5248_1640686" id="P5248_1640686" name="P5248_1640686">14</a></sup> that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again: "Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5249_1640997" id="P5249_1640997" name="P5249_1640997">15</a></sup> wherefore He had determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable, because "perfect, converting the soul"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5250_1641270" id="P5250_1641270" name="P5250_1641270">16</a></sup> from idols unto God. This likewise will be the word concerning which the same Isaiah says, "For the Lord will make a decisive word in the land."<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5251_1641432" id="P5251_1641432" name="P5251_1641432">17</a></sup> Because the New Testament is compendiously short,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5252_1641554" id="P5252_1641554" name="P5252_1641554">18</a></sup> and freed from the minute and perplexing<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5253_1641614" id="P5253_1641614" name="P5253_1641614">19</a></sup> burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself?

That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy of Mary,<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5259_1643040" id="P5259_1643040" name="P5259_1643040">25</a></sup> He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of the stem of Jesse.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5260_1643581" id="P5260_1643581" name="P5260_1643581">26</a></sup> Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and <i>that</i> amongst all nations, by Malachi when he says: "I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name, even a pure offering"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5261_1644145" id="P5261_1644145" name="P5261_1644145">27</a></sup> -meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,-it is of necessity that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those things of which <i>the change</i> is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there is nothing different which is not contrary.<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5262_1644551" id="P5262_1644551" name="P5262_1644551">28</a></sup> Of that very thing, therefore, there will be predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator's prejudice those examples from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations and affections? "I will wound," He says, "and I will heal; ""I will kill," He says again, "and I will make alive"<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5263_1645272" id="P5263_1645272" name="P5263_1645272">29</a></sup> -even the same "who createth evil and maketh peace; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn52.htm#P5264_1645349" id="P5264_1645349" name="P5264_1645349">30</a></sup> from which you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you not reckoned up the <i>Antitheses</i> also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who is for ever contrary to Himself?

There would be still wanted that Gospel which St. Paul found in existence, to which he yielded his belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account went up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, "lest he should run, or had been running in vain; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5300_1650853" id="P5300_1650853" name="P5300_1650853">63</a></sup> in other words, that the faith which he had learned, and the gospel which he was preaching, might be in accordance with theirs. Then, at last, having conferred with the (primitive) authors, and having agreed with them touching the rule of faith, they joined their hands in fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office of preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the Jews, and St. Paul to the Jews and the Gentiles. Inasmuch, therefore, as the enlightener of St. Luke himself desired the authority of his predecessors for both his own faith and preaching, how much more may not I require for Luke's Gospel that which was necessary for the Gospel of his master.<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5301_1651557" id="P5301_1651557" name="P5301_1651557">64</a></sup> </p>

But then, even if he censures Peter and John and James, who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. They seemed to be changing their company<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5315_1653464" id="P5315_1653464" name="P5315_1653464">75</a></sup> from respect of persons. And yet as Paul himself "became all things to all men,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5316_1653569" id="P5316_1653569" name="P5316_1653569">76</a></sup> that he might gain all, it was possible that Peter also might have betaken himself to the same plan of practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in like manner, if false apostles also crept in, their character too showed itself in their insisting upon circumcision and the Jewish ceremonies. So that it was not on account of their preaching, but of their conversation, that they were marked by St. Paul, who would with equal impartiality have marked them with censure, if they had erred at all with respect to God the Creator or His Christ. Each several case will therefore have to be distinguished. When Marcion complains that apostles are suspected (for their prevarication and dissimulation) of having even depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom Christ chose. If, then, the apostles, who are censured simply for inconsistency of walk, composed the Gospel in a pure form,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5317_1654509" id="P5317_1654509" name="P5317_1654509">77</a></sup> but false apostles interpolated their true record; and if our own copies have been made from these,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5318_1654624" id="P5318_1654624" name="P5318_1654624">78</a></sup> where will that genuine text<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5319_1654679" id="P5319_1654679" name="P5319_1654679">79</a></sup> of the apostle's writings be found which has not suffered adulteration? Which was it that enlightened Paul, and through him Luke? It is either completely blotted out, as if by some deluge-being obliterated by the inundation of falsifiers-in which case even Marcion does not possess the true Gospel; or else, is that very <i>edition</i> which Marcion alone possesses <i>the</i> true one, that is, of the apostles? How, then, does that agree with ours, which is said not to be (the work) of apostles, but of Luke? Or else, again, if that which Marcion uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply because it does agree with ours (which, of course,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5320_1655338" id="P5320_1655338" name="P5320_1655338">80</a></sup> is, also adulterated in its title), then it is the work of apostles.

So that, whilst he amends, he only confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior one, for he amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that <i>that</i> is the later one, which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made his own Gospel, and a novel one too.</p>

But how comes it to pass, if the apostles published nothing, that their disciples were more forward in such a work; for they could not have been disciples, without any instruction from their masters? If, then, it be evident that these (Gospels) also were current in the churches, why did not Marcion touch them-either to amend them if they were adulterated, or to acknowledge them if they were uncorrupt? For it is but natural<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5375_1664696" id="P5375_1664696" name="P5375_1664696">129</a></sup> that they who were perverting the gospel, should be more solicitous about the perversion of those things whose authority they knew to be more generally received. Even the false apostles (were so called) on this very account, because they imitated the apostles by means of their falsification. In <i>as</i> far, then, as he might have amended what there was to amend, if found corrupt, in <i>so</i> far did he firmly imply<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5376_1665121" id="P5376_1665121" name="P5376_1665121">130</a></sup> that all was free from corruption which he did not think required amendment.

For if the (Gospels) of the apostles<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5378_1665401" id="P5378_1665401" name="P5378_1665401">132</a></sup> have come down to us in their integrity, whilst Luke's, which is received amongst us,<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5379_1665523" id="P5379_1665523" name="P5379_1665523">133</a></sup> so far accords with their rule as to be on a par with them in permanency of reception in the churches, it clearly follows that Luke's Gospel also has come down to us in like integrity until the sacrilegious treatment of Marcion. In short, when Marcion laid hands on it, it then became diverse and hostile to the Gospels of the apostles. I will therefore advise his followers, that they either change these Gospels, however late to do so, into a conformity with their own, whereby they may seem to be in agreement with the apostolic writings (for they are daily retouching their work, as daily they are convicted by us); or else that they blush for their master, who stands self-condemned<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5380_1666331" id="P5380_1666331" name="P5380_1666331">134</a></sup> either way-when once<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5381_1666369" id="P5381_1666369" name="P5381_1666369">135</a></sup> he hands on the truth of the gospel conscience smitten, or again<sup><a href="footnote/fn53.htm#P5382_1666453" id="P5382_1666453" name="P5382_1666453">136</a></sup> subverts it by shameless tampering.

For the prophecy about place He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: "The business on which we are come, do at once." Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5424_1675421" id="P5424_1675421" name="P5424_1675421">172</a></sup> and, "It is not meet to take the children'sbread, and to cast it to dogs,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5425_1675517" id="P5425_1675517" name="P5425_1675517">173</a></sup> -in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the "bread" of His doctrine; surely it is because they are "children" that He shows them this priority.<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5426_1675958" id="P5426_1675958" name="P5426_1675958">174</a></sup> Observe, He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as "dogs." For to whom else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the synagogue-one so abruptly appearing,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5427_1676287" id="P5427_1676287" name="P5427_1676287">175</a></sup> so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census of Augustus-that most faithful witness of the Lord's nativity, kept in the archives of Rome? They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right of entering<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5428_1676727" id="P5428_1676727" name="P5428_1676727">176</a></sup> the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But "they were all astonished at His doctrine." Of course they were; "for, says (St. Luke), "His word was with power<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5429_1677113" id="P5429_1677113" name="P5429_1677113">177</a></sup> -not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No doubt, His divine discourse<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5430_1677231" id="P5430_1677231" name="P5430_1677231">178</a></sup> gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of "astonishment, they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also, without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity, Inasmuch, then, as the Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of His word produced astonishment, it more naturally<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5431_1677982" id="P5431_1677982" name="P5431_1677982">179</a></sup> shows that His teaching was in accordance with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged as belonging to Him,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5432_1678239" id="P5432_1678239" name="P5432_1678239">180</a></sup> in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the same passage, "the spirit of an unclean devil" exclaims: "What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5433_1678598" id="P5433_1678598" name="P5433_1678598">181</a></sup> I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5434_1678771" id="P5434_1678771" name="P5434_1678771">182</a></sup> Elsewhere<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5435_1678806" id="P5435_1678806" name="P5435_1678806">183</a></sup> there has been already given a full consideration of His titles.</p>
<p>My present discussion is, how the evil spirit could have known that He was called by such a name, when there had never at any time been uttered about Him a single prophecy by a god who was unknown, and up to that time silent, of whom it was not possible for Him to be attested as "the Holy One," as (of a god) unknown even to his own Creator. What similar <i>event</i> could he then have published<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5437_1679398" id="P5437_1679398" name="P5437_1679398">184</a></sup> of a <i>new</i> deity, whereby he might betoken for "the holy one" of the rival god? Simply that he went into the synagogue, and did nothing even in word against the Creator? As therefore he could not by any means acknowledge him, whom he was ignorant of, to be Jesus and the Holy One of God; so did he acknowledge Him whom he knew (to be both). For he remembered how that the prophet had prophesied<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5438_1679818" id="P5438_1679818" name="P5438_1679818">185</a></sup> of "the Holy One" of God, and how that God's name of "Jesus" was in the son of Nun.<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5439_1679948" id="P5439_1679948" name="P5439_1679948">186</a></sup> These facts he had also received<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5440_1680049" id="P5440_1680049" name="P5440_1680049">187</a></sup> from the angel, according to our Gospel: "Wherefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called <i>the Holy One</i>, the Son of God; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5441_1680200" id="P5441_1680200" name="P5441_1680200">188</a></sup> and, "Thou shalt call his name <i>Jesus</i>."<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5442_1680290" id="P5442_1680290" name="P5442_1680290">189</a></sup> Thus he actually had (although only an evil spirit) some idea of the Lord's dispensation, rather than Of any strange and heretofore imperfectly understood one. Because he also premised this question: "What have we to do with Thee? "-not as if referring to a strange Jesus, to whom pertain the <i>evil</i> spirits of the Creator. Nor did he say, What hast Thou to do with us? but, "What have we to do with Thee? "as if deploring himself, and deprecating his own calamity; at the prospect of which he adds: "Art Thou come to destroy us? "So completely did he acknowledge in Jesus the Son of that God who was judicial and avenging, and (so to speak) severe,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5443_1680958" id="P5443_1680958" name="P5443_1680958">190</a></sup> and not of him who was simply good,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5444_1681008" id="P5444_1681008" name="P5444_1681008">191</a></sup> and knew not how to destroy or how to punish! Now for what purpose have we adduced his passage first?<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5445_1681125" id="P5445_1681125" name="P5445_1681125">192</a></sup> In order to show that Jesus was neither acknowledged by the evil spirit, nor affirmed by Himself, to be any other than the Creator's. Well, but Jesus rebuked him, you say. To be sure he did, as being an envious (spirit), and in his very confession only petulant, and evil in adulation-just as if it had been Christ's highest glory to have come for the destruction of demons, and not for the salvation of mankind; whereas His wish really was that His disciples should not glory in the subjection of evil spirits but in the fair beauty of salvation.<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5446_1681693" id="P5446_1681693" name="P5446_1681693">193</a></sup> Why else<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5447_1681745" id="P5447_1681745" name="P5447_1681745">194</a></sup> did He rebuke him? If it was because he was entirely wrong (in his invocation), then He was neither Jesus nor the Holy One of God; if it was because he was partially wrong-for having supposed him to be, rightly enough,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5448_1681980" id="P5448_1681980" name="P5448_1681980">195</a></sup> Jesus and the Holy One of God, but also as belonging to the Creator-most unjustly would He have rebuked him for thinking what he knew he ought to think (about Him), and for not supposing that of Him which he knew not that he ought to suppose-that he was another Jesus, and the holy one of the other god. If, however, the rebuke has not a more probable meaning<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5449_1682356" id="P5449_1682356" name="P5449_1682356">196</a></sup> than that which we ascribe to it, follows that the evil spirit made no mistake, and was not rebuked for lying; for it was Jesus Himself, besides whom it was impossible for the evil spirit to have acknowledged any other, whilst Jesus affirmed that He was He whom the evil spirit had acknowledged, by not rebuking him for uttering a lie.</p>

It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters, intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already laid it down, in opposition to his <i>Antitheses</i>, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial care,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5495_1691419" id="P5495_1691419" name="P5495_1691419">234</a></sup> as a proof in his domain,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5496_1691476" id="P5496_1691476" name="P5496_1691476">235</a></sup> a certain companion in misery (<font face="SPIonic">suntalai/pwron</font>), and associate in hatred (<font face="SPIonic">summisou/menon</font>), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5497_1691643" id="P5497_1691643" name="P5497_1691643">236</a></sup> I shall not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat food,<sup><a href="footnote/fn54.htm#P5498_1692043" id="P5498_1692043" name="P5498_1692043">237</a></sup> forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious: wherever a man should mix himself with the sinner.

The prescription, therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5501_1692972" id="P5501_1692972" name="P5501_1692972">240</a></sup> of the law that He touched the leper-disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement-how could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5502_1693147" id="P5502_1693147" name="P5502_1693147">241</a></sup> which could be defiled? For a phantom is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom, will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material capacity<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5503_1693527" id="P5503_1693527" name="P5503_1693527">242</a></sup> for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue.

From what can the Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha-because, <i>in fact</i>, the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground that He was <i>once</i> more powerful than a servant of the Creator-since, in comparison with the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater!<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5521_1697999" id="P5521_1697999" name="P5521_1697999">260</a></sup> For the cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ performed, when it has <i>simply</i> done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man to publish abroad <i>the cure</i>; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested that the usual course should be followed: "Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the offering which Moses commanded."<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5522_1698604" id="P5522_1698604" name="P5522_1698604">261</a></sup> For the figurative signs of the law in its types He still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5523_1698737" id="P5523_1698737" name="P5523_1698737">262</a></sup> These types signified that a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5524_1698836" id="P5524_1698836" name="P5524_1698836">263</a></sup> from the stains thereof by the word of God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5525_1699056" id="P5525_1699056" name="P5525_1699056">264</a></sup> Accordingly He added: "that it may be for a testimony unto you"-one, no doubt, whereby He would testify that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5526_1699421" id="P5526_1699421" name="P5526_1699421">265</a></sup> their sicknesses and infirmities. This very consistent and becoming explanation of "the testimony," that adulator of his own Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept. Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding the law,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5527_1700511" id="P5527_1700511" name="P5527_1700511">266</a></sup> he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5528_1700843" id="P5528_1700843" name="P5528_1700843">267</a></sup> as the destroyer of a good law. So that if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5529_1701238" id="P5529_1701238" name="P5529_1701238">268</a></sup> because he knew their disposition,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5530_1701288" id="P5530_1701288" name="P5530_1701288">269</a></sup> he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the law,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5531_1701375" id="P5531_1701375" name="P5531_1701375">270</a></sup> since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5532_1701566" id="P5532_1701566" name="P5532_1701566">271</a></sup> to have persisted in his patience.

Of what testimony, I ask,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5533_1701727" id="P5533_1701727" name="P5533_1701727">272</a></sup> if not that of the assertion of the law?

And then the discussion will turn on the point, of which human parent He ought to be accounted the son-of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of God the Father, He is not, of course, (the son) of a human father. If He is not of a human father, it follows that He must be (the son) of a human mother. If of a human mother, it is evident that she must be a virgin.

Now, if this distinction be observed, that is to say, if He be Son of man as born of His mother, because not begotten of a father, and His mother be a virgin, because His father is not human-He will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a virgin should conceive,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5568_1708733" id="P5568_1708733" name="P5568_1708733">304</a></sup> On what principle you, Marcion, can admit Him Son of man, I cannot possibly see.

One thing alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname your God as actually the human father of Christ, as Valentinus did<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5572_1709445" id="P5572_1709445" name="P5572_1709445">308</a></sup> with his ¦on; or else to deny that the Virgin was human, which even Valentinus did not do.

"Is not this enough to prove that He is the Christ of prophecy? For if He gives Himself that appellation which was provided in the prophecy for the Christ of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to be understood as Him to whom (the appellation) was assigned by the prophet. But perhaps<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5574_1709989" id="P5574_1709989" name="P5574_1709989">310</a></sup> it can be regarded as a simple identity of names;<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5575_1710056" id="P5575_1710056" name="P5575_1710056">311</a></sup> and yet we have maintained<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5576_1710116" id="P5576_1710116" name="P5576_1710116">312</a></sup> that neither Christ nor Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed any condition of diversity. But as regards the appellation "Son of man," in <i>as</i> far as it Occurs by accident,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5577_1710370" id="P5577_1710370" name="P5577_1710370">313</a></sup> in <i>so</i> far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5578_1710461" id="P5578_1710461" name="P5578_1710461">314</a></sup> a casual identity of names. For it is of pure<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5579_1710521" id="P5579_1710521" name="P5579_1710521">315</a></sup> accident, especially when the same cause does not appear<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5580_1710594" id="P5580_1710594" name="P5580_1710594">316</a></sup> whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if Marcion's Christ be also said to be born of man, then he too would receive an identical appellation, and there would be two Sons of man, as also two Christs and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the sole right of Him in whom it has a suitable reason,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5581_1710939" id="P5581_1710939" name="P5581_1710939">317</a></sup> if it be claimed for another in whom there is an identity of name, but not of appellation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5582_1711045" id="P5582_1711045" name="P5582_1711045">318</a></sup> then the identity of name even looks suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of appellation. And it follows that He must be believed to be One and the Same, who is found to be the more fit to receive both the name and the appellation; while the other is excluded, who has no right to the appellation, because he has no reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled to both than He who is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ and the appellation of Son of man, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen by the king of Babylon in the furnace with His martyrs: "the fourth, who was like the Son of man."<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5583_1711884" id="P5583_1711884" name="P5583_1711884">319</a></sup> He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as "the Son of man, coming in the clouds of heaven" as a Judge, as also the Scripture shows.<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5584_1712047" id="P5584_1712047" name="P5584_1712047">320</a></sup> What I have advanced might have been sufficient concerning the designation in prophecy of the Son of man. But the Scripture offers me further information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself. For when the Jews, who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was God also, as being likewise the Son of God, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive sins, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5585_1712512" id="P5585_1712512" name="P5585_1712512">321</a></sup> about <i>man</i>, answer them, that He<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5586_1712579" id="P5586_1712579" name="P5586_1712579">322</a></sup> had power to remit sins; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the Son of man, He also named a human being? except it were because He wanted, by help of the very designation "Son of man" from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to reflect<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5587_1712839" id="P5587_1712839" name="P5587_1712839">323</a></sup> as to show them that He who remitted sins was God and man-that only Son of man, indeed, in the prophecy of Daniel, who had obtained the power of judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving sins likewise (for He who judges also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5588_1713143" id="P5588_1713143" name="P5588_1713143">324</a></sup> was shattered to pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily acknowledge Him to be the Son of man Himself by His own actual forgiveness of sins. I make one more observation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5589_1713365" id="P5589_1713365" name="P5589_1713365">325</a></sup> how that He has nowhere as yet professed Himself to be the Son of God-but for the first time in this passage, in which for the first time He has remitted sins; that is, in which for the first time He has used His function of <i>judgment</i>, by the absolution. All that the opposite side has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully weigh<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5590_1713738" id="P5590_1713738" name="P5590_1713738">326</a></sup> what it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also Son of man, in order to save Him from the charge of falsehood; and, on the other hand, to deny that He was born of woman, lest they grant that He was the Virgin's son. Since, however, the divine authority and the nature of the case, and common sense, do not admit this insane position of the heretics, we have here the opportunity of putting in a veto<sup><a href="footnote/fn55.htm#P5591_1714251" id="P5591_1714251" name="P5591_1714251">327</a></sup> in the briefest possible terms, <i>on the substance of Christ's body</i>, against Marcion's phantoms.

How, moreover, does it happen that he proposed the similitude of a <i>physician</i>, if he did not verify it?

For if there had been no ministry of John at all-"the voice," as Isaiah calls him, "of one crying in the wilderness," and the preparer of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had not baptized (Christ) Himself<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5608_1717844" id="P5608_1717844" name="P5608_1717844">341</a></sup> along with others, nobody could have challenged the disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the disciples of John, who were constantly fasting and praying; because, if there existed any diversity<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5609_1718079" id="P5609_1718079" name="P5609_1718079">342</a></sup> between Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible, nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged.

This is the designation of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them.

Nor in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm.

Nor could there be any discussion about His annulling<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5643_1725409" id="P5643_1725409" name="P5643_1725409">373</a></sup> the Sabbath, if He had a right<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5644_1725463" id="P5644_1725463" name="P5644_1725463">374</a></sup> to annul it. Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men's astonishment therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first, lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary which rests on some novel institution<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5645_1725967" id="P5645_1725967" name="P5645_1725967">375</a></sup> of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because as nothing was as yet advanced <i>by Christ</i> touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5646_1726602" id="P5646_1726602" name="P5646_1726602">376</a></sup> god should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it Would be the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus rule. If Christ interfered with<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5647_1727023" id="P5647_1727023" name="P5647_1727023">377</a></sup> the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator's example; inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5648_1727271" id="P5648_1727271" name="P5648_1727271">378</a></sup> annulled the Sabbath, by the Creator's command-according to the opinion of those who think this of Christ <i>in this passage of St. Luke</i>, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then broken<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5649_1727575" id="P5649_1727575" name="P5649_1727575">379</a></sup> by Joshua,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5650_1727617" id="P5650_1727617" name="P5650_1727617">380</a></sup> so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ. But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews' most solemn day, He was only professedly following<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5651_1727841" id="P5651_1727841" name="P5651_1727841">381</a></sup> the Creator, as being His Christ, in this very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: "Your new moons and your Sabbaths my soul hateth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5652_1728031" id="P5652_1728031" name="P5652_1728031">382</a></sup> Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that <i>the Sabbath</i> day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in <i>Christ's</i> purpose.<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5653_1728805" id="P5653_1728805" name="P5653_1728805">383</a></sup> For from the Creator's Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5654_1729263" id="P5654_1729263" name="P5654_1729263">384</a></sup> -as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5655_1729417" id="P5655_1729417" name="P5655_1729417">385</a></sup> Even he remembered that this privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday's provision of food might free from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator's will,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5656_1730104" id="P5656_1730104" name="P5656_1730104">386</a></sup> when He bestowed the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5657_1730226" id="P5657_1730226" name="P5657_1730226">387</a></sup> put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5658_1730389" id="P5658_1730389" name="P5658_1730389">388</a></sup> of the Scripture and of the Creator's will. But because He did not directly defend<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5659_1730487" id="P5659_1730487" name="P5659_1730487">389</a></sup> His disciples, but excuses them; because He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5660_1730723" id="P5660_1730723" name="P5660_1730723">390</a></sup> because he puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5661_1730908" id="P5661_1730908" name="P5661_1730908">391</a></sup> the Creator's indulgence:<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5662_1731004" id="P5662_1731004" name="P5662_1731004">392</a></sup> because He is Himself good according to <i>His</i> example-is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5663_1731205" id="P5663_1731205" name="P5663_1731205">393</a></sup> that they might accuse Him-surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5664_1731426" id="P5664_1731426" name="P5664_1731426">394</a></sup> is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour, making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, "In it thou shalt not do any work of thine,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5665_1731774" id="P5665_1731774" name="P5665_1731774">395</a></sup> by the word <i>thine</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5666_1731811" id="P5666_1731811" name="P5666_1731811">396</a></sup> it restricts the prohibition to human work-which every one performs in his own employment or business-and not to divine work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again, in the law it says, "Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5667_1732452" id="P5667_1732452" name="P5667_1732452">397</a></sup> except what is to be done for any soul,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5668_1732512" id="P5668_1732512" name="P5668_1732512">398</a></sup> that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5669_1732887" id="P5669_1732887" name="P5669_1732887">399</a></sup> because what is God's work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however, would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5670_1733113" id="P5670_1733113" name="P5670_1733113">400</a></sup> Wishing, therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered hand, He requires, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to destroy it? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5671_1733368" id="P5671_1733368" name="P5671_1733368">401</a></sup> In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was about to perform for a soul,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5672_1733489" id="P5672_1733489" name="P5672_1733489">402</a></sup> remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade-even human works; and what it enjoined-even divine works, which might be done for the benefit of any soul,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5673_1733684" id="P5673_1733684" name="P5673_1733684">403</a></sup> He was called "Lord of the Sabbath,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5674_1733755" id="P5674_1733755" name="P5674_1733755">404</a></sup> because He maintained<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5675_1733796" id="P5675_1733796" name="P5675_1733796">405</a></sup> the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath, He would have had the right to do so,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5676_1733929" id="P5676_1733929" name="P5676_1733929">406</a></sup> as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5677_1734134" id="P5677_1734134" name="P5677_1734134">407</a></sup> by the Creator, even at the time when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5678_1734330" id="P5678_1734330" name="P5678_1734330">408</a></sup> God's work, which He commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them <i>your Sabbaths</i>,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5679_1734589" id="P5679_1734589" name="P5679_1734589">409</a></sup> reckoning them as men's Sabbaths, not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of iniquities, and loving God "with the lip, not the heart,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5680_1734790" id="P5680_1734790" name="P5680_1734790">410</a></sup> He has yet put His own Sabbaths (those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for by the same prophet, in a later passage,<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5681_1734978" id="P5681_1734978" name="P5681_1734978">411</a></sup> He declared them to be "true, and delightful, and inviolable." Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, "I came not to destroy, the law, but to fulfil it,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5682_1735446" id="P5682_1735446" name="P5682_1735446">412</a></sup> although Marcion has gagged<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5683_1735494" id="P5683_1735494" name="P5683_1735494">413</a></sup> His mouth by this word.<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5684_1735536" id="P5684_1735536" name="P5684_1735536">414</a></sup> For even in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; <i>moreover</i>, He exhibits in a dear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the sacredness of the Sabbath<sup><a href="footnote/fn56.htm#P5685_1735925" id="P5685_1735925" name="P5685_1735925">415</a></sup> <i>and</i> while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity by His own beneficent action.

Others, again, admit that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend His own long-suffering<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5792_1757572" id="P5792_1757572" name="P5792_1757572">512</a></sup> in His beatitudes Just as if it were not competent to the Creator, in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made clemency<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5793_1757760" id="P5793_1757760" name="P5793_1757760">513</a></sup> the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the blessing and in providing against the curse.<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5794_1757998" id="P5794_1757998" name="P5794_1757998">514</a></sup> He had already said of old, "Behold, I have set before you blessing and cursing."<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5795_1758118" id="P5795_1758118" name="P5795_1758118">515</a></sup> Which statement was really a presage of<sup><a href="footnote/fn57.htm#P5796_1758180" id="P5796_1758180" name="P5796_1758180">516</a></sup> this temper of the gospel.

Of little worth is the recommendation which has for its prop the defamation of another.

But how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same <i>God</i> who had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.-If to Marcion's god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator's equal,<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5803_1759836" id="P5803_1759836" name="P5803_1759836">523</a></sup> both good and judicial; nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to be the one only God.

The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5808_1761019" id="P5808_1761019" name="P5808_1761019">528</a></sup> which accompany riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel.

Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty position from their wealth. In Psalms 48 He also turns off our care from these and says: "Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5820_1763481" id="P5820_1763481" name="P5820_1763481">540</a></sup> So also in Psalms 61: "Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5821_1763590" id="P5821_1763590" name="P5821_1763590">541</a></sup> do not set your heart upon them."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5822_1763641" id="P5822_1763641" name="P5822_1763641">542</a></sup> Lastly, this very same <i>woe</i> is pronounced of old by Amos against the rich, who also abounded in delights. "Woe unto them," says he, "who sleep upon beds of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5823_1764173" id="P5823_1764173" name="P5823_1764173">543</a></sup> Therefore, even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did, no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on "the full, because they shall hunger; on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5824_1764816" id="P5824_1764816" name="P5824_1764816">544</a></sup> To these will correspond these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator: "Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry "-even because ye have been filled; "behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed"<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5825_1765105" id="P5825_1765105" name="P5825_1765105">545</a></sup> -even ye who shall mourn, who now are laughing.

These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by simply bringing them into prominent view,<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5827_1765491" id="P5827_1765491" name="P5827_1765491">547</a></sup> not by making any change in them. "Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5828_1765648" id="P5828_1765648" name="P5828_1765648">548</a></sup> With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek after human flattery and praise: "O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and disturb the paths of your feet."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5829_1765871" id="P5829_1765871" name="P5829_1765871">549</a></sup> In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man, and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: "Cursed be the man that trusteth in man."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5830_1766056" id="P5830_1766056" name="P5830_1766056">550</a></sup> Whereas in Psalms 117 it is said: "It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5831_1766243" id="P5831_1766243" name="P5831_1766243">551</a></sup> Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good words.<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5832_1766364" id="P5832_1766364" name="P5832_1766364">552</a></sup> It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5833_1766653" id="P5833_1766653" name="P5833_1766653">553</a></sup> to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing to any other god but the God of the <i>true</i> prophets.</p>

Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations as, "Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness," He taught me to refrain from doing to others what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point, and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to its importance,<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5892_1780852" id="P5892_1780852" name="P5892_1780852">609</a></sup> to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage) the Lord-that is, Christ" was to make (or utter) a concise word on earth."<sup><a href="footnote/fn58.htm#P5893_1781017" id="P5893_1781017" name="P5893_1781017">610</a></sup> </p>

For it was "in labour" that they followed Him, and "with hope" did they minister to Him. On the subject of <i>parables</i>, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown that this kind of language<sup><a href="footnote/fn59.htm#P5996_1803980" id="P5996_1803980" name="P5996_1803980">704</a></sup> was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But there is that direct mode of His speaking<sup><a href="footnote/fn59.htm#P5997_1804095" id="P5997_1804095" name="P5997_1804095">705</a></sup> to the people"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand"<sup><a href="footnote/fn59.htm#P5998_1804187" id="P5998_1804187" name="P5998_1804187">706</a></sup> -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."<sup><a href="footnote/fn59.htm#P5999_1804352" id="P5999_1804352" name="P5999_1804352">707</a></sup> Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, "Ye shall hear with the ear, but shall not understand; "then followed, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." For they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with <i>these</i> the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, "Take heed how ye hear,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6000_1804931" id="P6000_1804931" name="P6000_1804931">708</a></sup> and hear not,-meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only attach a proper, sense to the <i>Creator's</i> admonition<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6001_1805097" id="P6001_1805097" name="P6001_1805097">709</a></sup> suitable to the meaning of Him who was rousing the people to hear by the words, "Take heed how ye hear," it amounted to a menace to such as would not hear. In fact,<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6002_1805285" id="P6002_1805285" name="P6002_1805285">710</a></sup> that most merciful god of yours, who judges not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6003_1805589" id="P6003_1805589" name="P6003_1805589">711</a></sup> What shall be given?

If by the Creator it be taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion's god it be given, by Marcion's god also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the "deprivation," it will not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger.

We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him, if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him? Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is done in the way of temptation ("Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6008_1807770" id="P6008_1807770" name="P6008_1807770">716</a></sup> again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6009_1807866" id="P6009_1807866" name="P6009_1807866">717</a></sup> ), so, when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation. However, <i>although I do not allow this sense</i>, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation, for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To what purpose could they have tempted Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been born or not-when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6010_1808409" id="P6010_1808409" name="P6010_1808409">718</a></sup> saw Him before them a veritable man?-whom they had heard call Himself "Son of man?

Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does a mother live on contemporaneously<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6012_1809220" id="P6012_1809220" name="P6012_1809220">720</a></sup> with her sons in every case?

On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was an act of faith.

Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6058_1822662" id="P6058_1822662" name="P6058_1822662">763</a></sup> it made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature, but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6059_1823040" id="P6059_1823040" name="P6059_1823040">764</a></sup> She therefore, not without reason,<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6060_1823093" id="P6060_1823093" name="P6060_1823093">765</a></sup> interpreted for herself the law, as meaning that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the prohibition of the law<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6061_1823360" id="P6061_1823360" name="P6061_1823360">766</a></sup> was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered health.

It was, however, a different reason which He assigned for the silence, even because "the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised again the third day."<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6096_1829940" id="P6096_1829940" name="P6096_1829940">798</a></sup> Now, inasmuch as these <i>sufferings</i> were actually foretold for the Creator's Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6097_1830086" id="P6097_1830086" name="P6097_1830086">799</a></sup> ), so by this application of them to His own case<sup><a href="footnote/fn60.htm#P6098_1830172" id="P6098_1830172" name="P6098_1830172">800</a></sup> does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted. At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake, that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings.

What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my beloved Son, hear ye, Him? "I considered thy works, and was astonished." When could this have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying?

Respecting the <i>face</i> of God, however, he had already heard, "No man shall see me, and live." "This thing," said He, "which thou hast spoken, will I do unto thee." Then Moses said, "Show me Thy glory." And the Lord, with like reference to the future, replied, "I will pass before thee in my glory," etc. Then at the last He says, "And then thou shall see my back."<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6188_1850423" id="P6188_1850423" name="P6188_1850423">887</a></sup> Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold, but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6189_1850569" id="P6189_1850569" name="P6189_1850569">888</a></sup> He had promised that He would make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, "If there shall be a prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with <i>him</i> will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently" (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), "and not in dark speeches."<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6190_1851193" id="P6190_1851193" name="P6190_1851193">889</a></sup> Now, although Marcion has denied<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6191_1851248" id="P6191_1851248" name="P6191_1851248">890</a></sup> that he is here represented as speaking with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood "mouth to mouth," he must also have stood "face to face" <i>with him</i>, to use his words,<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6192_1851451" id="P6192_1851451" name="P6192_1851451">891</a></sup> not far from him, in His very glory-not to say,<sup><a href="footnote/fn61.htm#P6193_1851553" id="P6193_1851553" name="P6193_1851553">892</a></sup> in His presence.

As therefore God is a just God, He spared not impious children, exacting as He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of course, from youth.

For to decide that the workman deserves his wages, is in itself a judicial act. There is no award which consists not in a process of judgment. The law of the Creator on this point also presents us with a corroboration, for He judges that labouring oxen are as labourers worthy of their hire: "Thou shall not muzzle," says He. "the ox when he treadeth out the corn."<sup><a href="footnote/fn62.htm#P6259_1864041" id="P6259_1864041" name="P6259_1864041">952</a></sup> Now, who is so good to man<sup><a href="footnote/fn62.htm#P6260_1864089" id="P6260_1864089" name="P6260_1864089">953</a></sup> as He who is also merciful to cattle?

Lastly, you may discover the suitable times of the promise, if you read what precedes the passage: "Be strong, ye weak hands and ye feeble knees: then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be articulate."<sup><a href="footnote/fn62.htm#P6289_1869925" id="P6289_1869925" name="P6289_1869925">981</a></sup> When, therefore, He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also did He put the scorpions and the serpents under the feet of His saints-even He who had first received this power from the Father, in order to bestow it upon others and then manifested it forth conformably to the order of prophecy.<sup><a href="footnote/fn62.htm#P6290_1870256" id="P6290_1870256" name="P6290_1870256">982</a></sup> </p>

This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of such as were seeing the things which others had only foretold. We shall by and by show, nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold, but yet had been hidden from the very prophets who foretold them, in order that they might be hidden also from the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a certain doctor of the law comes to the Lord and asks, "What shall I do to inherit <i>eternal</i> life?

If, indeed, it were only about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator's disposal, that he inquired and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which is at the disposal of Marcion's god, how is he to obtain the eternal one? Surely not in the same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward must be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your disciple, Marcion,<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6351_1882555" id="P6351_1882555" name="P6351_1882555">1040</a></sup> will not obtain his eternal life in consequence of loving your God, in the same way as the man who loves the Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is to be loved who promises the prolonged I life, He is not much more to be loved who offers the eternal life? Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6352_1883019" id="P6352_1883019" name="P6352_1883019">1041</a></sup> for one and the other life.

This he said, forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now, he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you find nowhere any proof, let me tell you<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6362_1885186" id="P6362_1885186" name="P6362_1885186">1048</a></sup> that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction in prayer, to whom John's disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner.

For he would by this time cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not knock.

Accordingly, the preceding similitude<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6381_1889269" id="P6381_1889269" name="P6381_1889269">1067</a></sup> represents the man who went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes him knock at a friend's house and not at a stranger's. But even if he has offended, man is more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion.

It is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as He says, "because of his importunity."<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6385_1890484" id="P6385_1890484" name="P6385_1890484">1071</a></sup> <i>Importunate</i>, however, the recent god could not have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6386_1890623" id="P6386_1890623" name="P6386_1890623">1072</a></sup> Him, therefore, whom you call the Creator recognise also as "Father." It is even He who knows what His children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails-not a serpent for a fish, nor for an egg a scorpion.<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6387_1890940" id="P6387_1890940" name="P6387_1890940">1073</a></sup> It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good, who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion's god, on the contrary, not having a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who, having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at whose command<sup><a href="footnote/fn63.htm#P6388_1891326" id="P6388_1891326" name="P6388_1891326">1074</a></sup> is also the unholy spirit.

It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart, and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore adds, "There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be known,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6459_1904892" id="P6459_1904892" name="P6459_1904892">1139</a></sup> in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god.

He then turns to His disciples with these words, "I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6460_1905496" id="P6460_1905496" name="P6460_1905496">1140</a></sup> They will, however, find Isaiah had already said, "See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to heart."<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6461_1905637" id="P6461_1905637" name="P6461_1905637">1141</a></sup> "But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell" (meaning, of course, the Creator); "yea, I say unto you, fear Him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6462_1905836" id="P6462_1905836" name="P6462_1905836">1142</a></sup> Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6463_1906013" id="P6463_1906013" name="P6463_1906013">1143</a></sup> whom He forbids to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very <i>God</i> for whom He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can draw also from the following words: "For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6464_1906360" id="P6464_1906360" name="P6464_1906360">1144</a></sup> Now they who shall confess Christ will have to be slain<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6465_1906438" id="P6465_1906438" name="P6465_1906438">1145</a></sup> before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: "Every one that denieth me before men shall be denied before God"<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6466_1906827" id="P6466_1906827" name="P6466_1906827">1146</a></sup> -by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had only confessed <i>God</i>. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will also deny the denier of Himself.

Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to death. And so Christ is the Creator's, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought to fear the Creator's hell. After deterring <i>His disciples</i> from denial of Himself, He adds an admonition to fear blasphemy: "Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him."<sup><a href="footnote/fn64.htm#P6468_1907939" id="P6468_1907939" name="P6468_1907939">1148</a></sup> Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the, blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to, Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell.

For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure guilty of either malignity or weakness.

For an attempt is made to modify this sense when it is applied to his god,-as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of i the severed ones? Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation? Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment, and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator.

Let no one think that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from the service of the Creator. What <i>folly</i>! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon-the Creator and money. You cannot indeed serve God-Him, of course whom they seemed to serve-and mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6633_1943751" id="P6633_1943751" name="P6633_1943751">1298</a></sup> If, however, he was giving himself out as another <i>god</i>, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out.

Now, how was it likely that He who had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting Him did He concede that service might be rendered to <i>Him</i>, since it was to Himself alone and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When, therefore, He lays down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to mention<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6635_1944554" id="P6635_1944554" name="P6635_1944554">1300</a></sup> the Creator if He were Himself a rival<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6636_1944615" id="P6636_1944615" name="P6636_1944615">1301</a></sup> to Him, He did (virtually) name the Creator, when He refrained from insisting"<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6637_1944710" id="P6637_1944710" name="P6637_1944710">1302</a></sup> that He was Master alone, without a rival god.

But in what way was the Creator foreign to the Pharisees, seeing that He was the proper God of the Jewish nation? Forasmuch then as the words, "Who will entrust to you the truer riches? "and, "Who will give you that which is mine? "are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6640_1945846" id="P6640_1945846" name="P6640_1945846">1305</a></sup> their unfaithfulness to the Creator and not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of mentioning Him) and the rival god-how that the latter would not commit his own truth to those who were unfaithful to the Creator.

For although, as we have shown, the Creator foretold that the old state of things would pass away and a new state would succeed, yet, inasmuch as John is shown to be both the forerunner and the pre-pater of the ways of that Lord who was to introduce the gospel and publish the kingdom of God, it follows from the very fact that John has come, that Christ must be that very Being who was to follow His harbinger John. So that, if the old course has ceased and the new has begun, with John intervening between them, there will be nothing wonderful in it, because it happens according to the purpose of the Creator; so that you may get a better proof for the kingdom of God from any quarter, however anomalous,<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6650_1948709" id="P6650_1948709" name="P6650_1948709">1315</a></sup> than from the conceit that the law and the prophets ended in John, and a new state of things began after him.

Since, however, you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet at the same time represented<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6666_1952051" id="P6666_1952051" name="P6666_1952051">1328</a></sup> the Father, even Him who united male and female, must He not have rather exculpated<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6667_1952153" id="P6667_1952153" name="P6667_1952153">1329</a></sup> than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe, if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them.

So that Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the Gospel of Matthew he says, "Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6681_1954845" id="P6681_1954845" name="P6681_1954845">1343</a></sup> He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery, who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth not have it in his power to put away his wife.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6682_1955226" id="P6682_1955226" name="P6682_1955226">1344</a></sup> Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of agreement!

You find Him also protecting marriage, in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness. You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would have them separated.

This he said in order the more severely to load Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother's wife, after she had been loosed from her husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not by the prescription of the (Levirate) law-for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6691_1957709" id="P6691_1957709" name="P6691_1957709">1353</a></sup> and who, when the prophet asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6692_1958021" id="P6692_1958021" name="P6692_1958021">1354</a></sup> tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham's bosom.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6693_1958128" id="P6693_1958128" name="P6693_1958128">1355</a></sup> For this passage, so far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it naturally<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6694_1958278" id="P6694_1958278" name="P6694_1958278">1356</a></sup> fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been condemned by him for his impious marriage.<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6695_1958413" id="P6695_1958413" name="P6695_1958413">1357</a></sup> It sets forth in bold outline<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6696_1958486" id="P6696_1958486" name="P6696_1958486">1358</a></sup> the end of both of them, the "torments" of Herod and the "comfort" of John, that even now Herod might hear that warning: "They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them."<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6697_1958689" id="P6697_1958689" name="P6697_1958689">1359</a></sup> Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6698_1958882" id="P6698_1958882" name="P6698_1958882">1360</a></sup> for those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself which dazzles<sup><a href="footnote/fn66.htm#P6699_1959142" id="P6699_1959142" name="P6699_1959142">1361</a></sup> his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham's bosom, where the poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. "Hell" (I take it) means one thing, and "Abraham's bosom" another. "A great gulf." is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have "lifted up his eyes,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6700_1959569" id="P6700_1959569" name="P6700_1959569">1362</a></sup> and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called Abraham's bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham's children, even from among the Gentiles (since he is "the father of many nations," which must be classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call Abraham's bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6701_1960313" id="P6701_1960313" name="P6701_1960313">1363</a></sup> and is appointed to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things shall complete the resurrection of all men with the "full recompense of their reward."<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6702_1960565" id="P6702_1960565" name="P6702_1960565">1364</a></sup> This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however, claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them.

If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive.

Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself such by His acts,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6731_1967709" id="P6731_1967709" name="P6731_1967709">1390</a></sup> to busy Himself with inquiries<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6732_1967822" id="P6732_1967822" name="P6732_1967822">1391</a></sup> into the qualities <i>and details</i> of cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ? If any pan of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He <i>yet</i> Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6733_1968501" id="P6733_1968501" name="P6733_1968501">1392</a></sup> Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6734_1968579" id="P6734_1968579" name="P6734_1968579">1393</a></sup> that "there were many lepers in lsrµl in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian," yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending to the abasement<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6735_1968858" id="P6735_1968858" name="P6735_1968858">1394</a></sup> of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6736_1969446" id="P6736_1969446" name="P6736_1969446">1395</a></sup> High Priest of God the Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However, what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: "Go," said He, "show yourselves to the priests."<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6737_1969957" id="P6737_1969957" name="P6737_1969957">1396</a></sup> Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of course pass as it best may,<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6738_1970242" id="P6738_1970242" name="P6738_1970242">1397</a></sup> if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these!<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6739_1970327" id="P6739_1970327" name="P6739_1970327">1398</a></sup> But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because<sup><a href="footnote/fn67.htm#P6740_1970509" id="P6740_1970509" name="P6740_1970509">1399</a></sup> they were obedient, and went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was destroying the law.

The Sadducees, who said there was no resurrection, in a discussion on that subject, had proposed to the Lord a case of law touching a certain woman, who, in accordance with the legal prescription, had been married to seven brothers who had died one after the other. The question therefore was, to which husband must she be reckoned to belong in the resurrection?<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6862_1996891" id="P6862_1996891" name="P6862_1996891">1512</a></sup> This, (observe, ) was the gist of the inquiry, this was the sum and substance of the dispute. And to it Christ was obliged to return a direct answer. He had nobody to fear; that it should seem advisable<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6863_1997119" id="P6863_1997119" name="P6863_1997119">1513</a></sup> for Him either to evade their questions, or to make them the occasion of indirectly mooting<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6864_1997233" id="P6864_1997233" name="P6864_1997233">1514</a></sup> a subject which He was not in the habit of teaching publicly at any other time. He therefore gave His answer, that "the children of this world marry."<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6865_1997408" id="P6865_1997408" name="P6865_1997408">1515</a></sup> You see how pertinent it was to the case in point. Because the question concerned the next world, and He was going to declare that no one marries there, He opens the way by laying down the principles that here, where there is death, there is also marriage. "But they whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; forasmuch as they cannot die any more, since they become equal to the angels, being made the children of God and of the resurrection."<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6866_1997971" id="P6866_1997971" name="P6866_1997971">1516</a></sup> If, then, the meaning of the answer must not turn on any other point than on the proposed question, and since the question proposed is fully understood from this sense of the answer,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6867_1998180" id="P6867_1998180" name="P6867_1998180">1517</a></sup> then the Lord's reply admits of no other interpretation than that by which the question is clearly understood.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6868_1998380" id="P6868_1998380" name="P6868_1998380">1518</a></sup> You have both the time in which marriage is permitted, and the time in which it is said to be unsuitable, laid before you, not on their own account, but in consequence of an inquiry about the resurrection. You have likewise a confirmation of the resurrection itself, and the whole question which the Sadducees mooted, who asked no question about another god, nor inquired about the proper law of marriage. Now, if you make Christ answer questions which were not submitted to Him, you, in fact, represent Him as having been unable to solve the points on which He was really consulted, and entrapped of course by the cunning of the Sadducees. I shall now proceed, by way of supererogation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6869_1999089" id="P6869_1999089" name="P6869_1999089">1519</a></sup> and after the rule (I have laid down about questions and answers),<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6870_1999179" id="P6870_1999179" name="P6870_1999179">1520</a></sup> to deal with the arguments which have any consistency in them.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6871_1999783" id="P6871_1999783" name="P6871_1999783">1521</a></sup> They procured then a copy of the Scripture, and made short work with its text, by reading it thus:<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6872_1999904" id="P6872_1999904" name="P6872_1999904">1522</a></sup> "Those whom <i>the god of that world</i> shall account worthy." They add the phrase "<i>of that world</i>" to the word "<i>god</i>," whereby they make another god"the god of that world; "whereas the passage ought to be read thus: "Those whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world" (removing the distinguishing phrase "<i>of this world</i>" to the end of the clause,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6873_2000341" id="P6873_2000341" name="P6873_2000341">1523</a></sup> in other words, "Those whom God shall account worthy of obtaining and rising to that world." For the question submitted to Christ had nothing to do with <i>the god</i>, but only with <i>the state</i>, of that world. It was: "Whose wife should this woman be in that world after the resurrection? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6874_2001478" id="P6874_2001478" name="P6874_2001478">1524</a></sup> They thus subvert His answer respecting the essential question of marriage, and apply His words, "The children of this world marry and are given in marriage," as if they referred to the Creator's men, and His permission to them to marry; whilst they themselves whom the god of that world-that is, the rival god-accounted worthy of the resurrection, do not marry even here, because they are not children of this world. But the fact is, that, having been consulted about marriage in <i>that</i> world, not in this present one, He had simply declared the non-existence of that to which the question related. They, indeed, who had caught the very force of His voice, and pronunciation, and expression, discovered no other sense than what had reference to the matter of the question. Accordingly, the Scribes exclaimed, "Master, Thou hast well said."<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6875_2002339" id="P6875_2002339" name="P6875_2002339">1525</a></sup> For He had affirmed the resurrection, by describing the form<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6876_2002422" id="P6876_2002422" name="P6876_2002422">1526</a></sup> thereof in opposition to the opinion of the Sadducees. Now, He did not reject the attestation of those who had assumed His answer to bear this meaning. If, however, the Scribes thought Christ was David's Son, whereas (David) himself calls Him Lord,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6877_2002719" id="P6877_2002719" name="P6877_2002719">1527</a></sup> what relation has this to Christ? David did not literally confute<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6878_2002810" id="P6878_2002810" name="P6878_2002810">1528</a></sup> an error of the Scribes, yet David asserted the honour of Christ, when he more prominently affirmed that He was his Lord than his Son,-an attribute which was hardly suitable to the destroyer of the Creator. But how consistent is the interpretation on our side of the question! For He, who had been a little while ago invoked by the blind man as "the Son of David,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6879_2003200" id="P6879_2003200" name="P6879_2003200">1529</a></sup> then made no remark on the subject, not having the Scribes in His presence; whereas He now purposely moots the point before them, and <i>that</i> of His own accord,<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6880_2003383" id="P6880_2003383" name="P6880_2003383">1530</a></sup> in order that He might show Himself whom the Mind man, following the doctrine of the Scribes, had simply declared to be the Son of David, to be also his Lord. He thus honoured the blind man's faith which had acknowledged His Sonship to David; but at the same time He struck a blow at the tradition of the Scribes, which prevented them from knowing that He was also (David's) Lord. Whatever had relation to the glory of the Creator's Christ, no other would thus guard and maintain<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6881_2003885" id="P6881_2003885" name="P6881_2003885">1531</a></sup> but Himself the Creator's Christ.</p>

The impudence, therefore, of Marcion's Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, whereas this name does not at all belong to <i>him</i>, since he is not the Christ and Jesus of the Creator, to whom these names do properly appertain; and more especially when he prohibits those to be received whose very equal in imposture he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6888_2005048" id="P6888_2005048" name="P6888_2005048">1535</a></sup> ) comes in a name which belongs to another-unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously assumed name the disciples (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly given to Him, possessed also the verity thereof.

What will you do, then, when He Himself comes who is the very Proprietor of these names, the Creator's Christ and Jesus? Will you reject Him? But how iniquitous, how unjust and disrespectful to the good God, that you should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received another in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times. "Wars," I observe, "and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and pestilence, and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs from heaven"<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6891_2006143" id="P6891_2006143" name="P6891_2006143">1538</a></sup> -all which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God.

The Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? For He affirms thai these appointments of His must fully come to pass; but surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). "But before all these," He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed were "to turn for a testimony to them," and for their salvation.<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6893_2006846" id="P6893_2006846" name="P6893_2006846">1540</a></sup> Hear what is predicted in Zechariah: "The Lord of hosts<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6894_2006926" id="P6894_2006926" name="P6894_2006926">1541</a></sup> shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill the bowls as it were of the altar.

In a prophecy of wars which were to be waged with legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, "they roll as sacred stones," and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones, upon which we are ourselves edified-"built," as St. Paul says, "upon the foundation of the apostles,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn68.htm#P6897_2008294" id="P6897_2008294" name="P6897_2008294">1544</a></sup> who, like "consecrated stones," were rolled up and down exposed to the attack of all men.

But what does the Lord say afterwards? "And then shall they see the Son of man coming from the heavens with very great power. And when these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption hath come near," that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6917_2012481" id="P6917_2012481" name="P6917_2012481">1563</a></sup> "So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6918_2012620" id="P6918_2012620" name="P6918_2012620">1564</a></sup> This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: "Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6919_2012830" id="P6919_2012830" name="P6919_2012830">1565</a></sup> etc. "And there was given unto Him the kingly power,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6920_2012907" id="P6920_2012907" name="P6920_2012907">1566</a></sup> which (in the parable) "He went away into a far country to receive for Himself," leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6921_2013079" id="P6921_2013079" name="P6921_2013079">1567</a></sup> -even (that universal kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance."<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6922_2013285" id="P6922_2013285" name="P6922_2013285">1568</a></sup> "And all that glory shall serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taker from Him, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6923_2013471" id="P6923_2013471" name="P6923_2013471">1569</a></sup> because in it "men shall not die, neither shall they marry, but be like the angels."<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6924_2013579" id="P6924_2013579" name="P6924_2013579">1570</a></sup> It is about the same advent of the Son of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: "Thou wentest forth for the salvation of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6925_2013789" id="P6925_2013789" name="P6925_2013789">1571</a></sup> -in other words, those who shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore, these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the great catastrophes, on the other-both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect-whilst the promises should be ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from the inquiry of the disciples<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6926_2014878" id="P6926_2014878" name="P6926_2014878">1572</a></sup> down to the parable of the fig-tree<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6927_2014939" id="P6927_2014939" name="P6927_2014939">1573</a></sup> you will find the sense in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of <i>my Christ</i>, then, when you ascribe to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you will have it that it is the coming of <i>your Christ</i>, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations. You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: "Behold the fig-tree, and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near."<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6928_2016904" id="P6928_2016904" name="P6928_2016904">1574</a></sup> Now, if the fructification of the common trees<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6929_2016977" id="P6929_2016977" name="P6929_2016977">1575</a></sup> be an antecedent sign of the approach of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If, therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator's to whom are ascribed the tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled. He further declares, "that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled."<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6930_2017948" id="P6930_2017948" name="P6930_2017948">1576</a></sup> What things, pray, are these?

If the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no "jealous God." But let heaven and earth pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And so Isaiah predicted that it should.<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6932_2018558" id="P6932_2018558" name="P6932_2018558">1578</a></sup> Let the disciples also be warned, "lest their hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come upon them unawares, like a snare "<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6933_2018761" id="P6933_2018761" name="P6933_2018761">1579</a></sup> -if indeed they should forget God amidst the abundance and occupation of the world.

When He so earnestly expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it <i>His own</i> feast; for it would have been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, "This is my body,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6957_2024134" id="P6957_2024134" name="P6957_2024134">1600</a></sup> that is, the figure of my body.

If, however, (as Marcion might say, ) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would contribute very well to the support of Marcion's theory of a phantom body,<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6959_2024703" id="P6959_2024703" name="P6959_2024703">1602</a></sup> that bread should have been crucified!But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible thing, say) a melon,<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6960_2024876" id="P6960_2024876" name="P6960_2024876">1603</a></sup> which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: "I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6961_2025229" id="P6961_2025229" name="P6961_2025229">1604</a></sup> they devised a device against me, saying, <i>Let us cast the tree upon His bread</i>,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6962_2025396" id="P6962_2025396" name="P6962_2025396">1605</a></sup> which means, of course, the cross upon His body.

He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the <i>new</i> testament to be sealed "in His blood,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6964_2026008" id="P6964_2026008" name="P6964_2026008">1607</a></sup> affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong to a body which is not <i>a body</i> of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood. In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood, turn to Isaiah, who asks, "Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6965_2026727" id="P6965_2026727" name="P6965_2026727">1608</a></sup> The prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His passion, clad in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6966_2027407" id="P6966_2027407" name="P6966_2027407">1609</a></sup> saying, "He washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes"<sup><a href="footnote/fn69.htm#P6967_2027506" id="P6967_2027506" name="P6967_2027506">1610</a></sup> -in His garments and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He now consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe His blood.</p>

"Two angels however, appeared there."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7054_2044520" id="P7054_2044520" name="P7054_2044520">1688</a></sup> For just so many honorary companions<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7055_2044580" id="P7055_2044580" name="P7055_2044580">1689</a></sup> were required by the word of God, which usually prescribes "<i>two witnesses</i>."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7056_2044687" id="P7056_2044687" name="P7056_2044687">1690</a></sup> Moreover, the women, returning from the sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, "Come, ye women, who return from the vision; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7057_2044943" id="P7057_2044943" name="P7057_2044943">1691</a></sup> that is, "come," to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets. For as two of them were taking a walk, and when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing that it was He, and whilst He dissembled His knowledge of what had just taken place,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7058_2045512" id="P7058_2045512" name="P7058_2045512">1692</a></sup> they say: "But we trusted that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7059_2045621" id="P7059_2045621" name="P7059_2045621">1693</a></sup> -meaning their own, that is, the Creator's Christ. So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as another Christ! They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed by them, could He have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really He whom He was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and the prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good; God. But at no time even after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them as any other than what, on their own showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7060_2046270" id="P7060_2046270" name="P7060_2046270">1694</a></sup> reproached them: "O fools, and slow of heart in not believing that which He spake unto you."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7061_2046379" id="P7061_2046379" name="P7061_2046379">1695</a></sup> By saying this, He proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the same God. For the same thing was said by the angels to the women: "Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7062_2046705" id="P7062_2046705" name="P7062_2046705">1696</a></sup> "<i>Must</i> be delivered up; "and why, except that it was so written by God the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at His passion, and because they doubted of the truth of the resurrection which had been reported to them by the women, whereby (they showed that) they had not believed Him to have been the very same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be believed by them in this wise, He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to be-the Creator's Christ, the Redeemer of lsrµl. But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they were doubting whether He were not a phantom-nay, were supposing that He was one-He says to them, "Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7063_2047508" id="P7063_2047508" name="P7063_2047508">1697</a></sup> my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have."<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7064_2047729" id="P7064_2047729" name="P7064_2047729">1698</a></sup> Now Marcion was unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some statements which even made against him-I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the passages which he did not suppress, when he could have done so, either to deny that he had expunged anything, or else to justify his suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he can subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text. Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, "A spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have," so transposed, as to mean, "A spirit, such as ye see me to be, hath not bones; "that is to say, it is not the nature of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a construction, when He might have simply said, "A spirit hath not bones, even as you observe that I have not? "Why, moreover, does He offer His hands and His feet for their examination-limbs which consist of bones-if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, "Know that it is I myself,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7065_2048760" id="P7065_2048760" name="P7065_2048760">1699</a></sup> when they had before known Him to be corporeal? Else, if He were altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat,<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7066_2048995" id="P7066_2048995" name="P7066_2048995">1700</a></sup> for the express purpose of showing them that He had teeth.<sup><a href="footnote/fn70.htm#P7067_2049078" id="P7067_2049078" name="P7067_2049078">1701</a></sup> </p>
