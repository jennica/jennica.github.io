<sup>33 </sup>Viz., the theatre and amphitheatre.

<p><a name="P1020_415039"></a>
<sup>1 </sup>[Kaye, apparently accepting the judgment of Dr. Neander, assigns this treatise to A.D. 204. The bounty here spoken of, then, must be that dispensed in honour of the victories over the Parthians, under Severus.]</p>

<sup>3 </sup>[A touch of our author's genius, inspired by the Phrygian enthusiam for martydom. The ground on which a martyr treads begins to be holy, even before the sacrifice, and in loosing his shoe the victim consecrates the spot and at the same time pays it homage.]</p>

<sup>5 </sup>[Gibbon will have it that the <i>De Corona</i> was written while Tertullian was orthodox, but this reference to the Montanist notion of "New Prophecy" seems to justify the decision of critics against Gibbon, who, as Kaye suggests (p. 53) was anxious to make Christianity itself responsible for military insubordination and for offences against Imperial Law.] </p>

<p><a name="P1094_451999"></a>
<sup>41 </sup>"Outside of the military service." By substituting <i>ex militia</i> for the corresponding words <i>extra militiam</i>, as has been proposed by Rigaltius, the sentence acquires a meaning such that desertion from the army is suggested as one of the methods by which a soldier who has become a Christian may continue faithful to Jesus. But the words <i>extra militiam</i> are a genuine part of the text. There is no good ground, therefore, for the statement of Gibbon: "Tertullian (<i>de Corona Militis</i>, c. xi.) suggests to them the expedient of deserting; a counsel which, if it had been generally known, was not very proper to conciliate the favour of the emperors toward the Christian sect."-Tr.</p>

<sup>43 </sup>[He was not yet quite a Montanist.]</p>
