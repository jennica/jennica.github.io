I have given the rendering of the latter, which seems preferred by Paley (Ov. <i>Fast.</i> vi. 213, note), who considers it = <i>me dius</i> (i.e., <i>Deus</i>) <i>fidius juvet</i>. Smith (<i>Lat. Dict. s.v</i>.) agrees with him, and explains it, <i>me deus fidius servet</i>. White and Riddle (<i>s.v</i>.) take the <i>me</i> (which appears to be <i>short</i>) as a "demonstrative" particle or prefix, and explain, "By the God of truth!"

<sup>173 </sup>This is, perhaps, the most obscure and difficult passage in the entire treatise. I have followed Oehler's reading, and given what appears to be his sense; but the readins are widely different, and it is doubtful whether any is correct. I can scarcely, however, help thinking that the "<i>se negant</i>" here, and the "<i>tamen non negavi</i>" below, are to be connected with the "<i>puto autem nec negare</i>" at the end of the former chapter; and that the true rendering is rather: "And [by so doing] deny themselves," <i>i.e</i>., deny their Christian name and faith. "Doubtless a time of persecution," such as the present time is-or "of prosecution," which would make very good sense-"and the place of the tribunal, and the person of the presiding judge, require them to <i>know</i> themselves," i.e., to have no shuffling or disguise. I submit this rendering with diffidencel but it does seem to me to suit the context better, and to harmonize better with the "Yet I have not denied," i.e., my name and faith, which follows, and with the "denying letters" which are mentioned at the end of the chapter.-Tr.</p>
<p><a name="P853_342253"></a>
<sup>174 </sup>Mr. Dodgson renders "conceiveth;" and the word is certainly capable of that meaning.</p>
<p><a name="P854_342611"></a>
<sup>175 </sup>See Matt. v. 28.</p>
<p><a name="P855_342983"></a>
<sup>176 </sup>Oehler understands "the lighter crime" or "charge" to be "swearing;" the "heavier," to be "denying the Lord Christ."</p>
<p><a name="P856_343749"></a>
<sup>177 </sup>See Luke i. 20,22,62,63.</p>
<p><a name="P857_343917"></a>
<sup>178 </sup>This is how Mr. Dodgson renders, and the rendering agrees with Oehler's punctuation. [So obscure however, is Dodgson's rendering that I have slightly changed the punctuation, to clarify it, and subjoin Oehler's text.] But perhaps we may read thus: "he speaks in his pen; he is heard in his waxen tablet : the hand is clearer than every sound ; the letter is more vocal than every mouth." [Oehler reads thus: "Cum manibus suis a corde dictat et nomen filii sine ore pronuntiat: loquitur in stilo, auditur in cera manus omni sono clarios, littera omni ore vocalior." I see no difficulty here.]</p>

<sup>183 </sup>[General references to Kaye (3d edition), which will be useful to those consulting that author's Tertullian, for Elucidations of the <i>De Idololatria</i>, are as follows: <i>Preface</i>, p. xxiii. Then, pp. 56, 141, 206, 231, 300, 360, 343, 360 and 362.]</p>

<sup>1 </sup>[It is the opinion of Dr. Neander that this treatise proceeded from our author before his lapse: but Bp. Kaye (p. xvi.) finds some exaggerated expressions in it, concerning the military life which savour of Montanism. Probably they do, but had he written the tract as a professed Mointanist, they would have been much less ambiguous, in all probability. At all events, a work so colourless that doctors can disagree about even its shading, must be regarded as practically orthodox. Exaggerated expressions are but the characteristics of the author's genius. We find the like in all writers of strongly marked individuality. Neander dates this treastise <i>circa</i> a.d. 197. That it was written at Carthage is the conviction of Kaye and Dr. Allix; see Kaye, p. 55.]</p>
