<sup>1 </sup>The notes of Dr. Holmes were bracketted, and I have been forced to remove this feature, as brackets are tokens in this edition of the contributions of American editors. The perpetual recurrence of brackets in his translations has led me to improve the page by parenthetical marks instead, which answer as well and rarely can be mistaken for the author's <i>parentheses</i>, while these disfigure the printer's work much less. I have sometimes substituted italics for brackets, where an inconsiderable word, like <i>and</i> or <i>for</i>, was bracketted by the translator. In every case that I have noted, an intelligent reader will readily perceive such instances; but a critic who may wish to praise, or condemn, should carefully compare the Edinburgh pages with our own. I found them so painful to the eye and so needlessly annoying to the reader, that I have taken the responsibility of making what seems to me a very great typographical improvement.</p>

<sup>22 </sup>Vincentius Lirinesis, in his celebrated <i>Commonitorium</i>, expresses the opinion of Catholic churchmen concerning Tertullian thus: "Tertullian, among the Latins, without controversy, is the chief of all our writers. For who was more learned than he? Who in divinity or humanity more practised? For, by a certain wonderful capacity of mind, he attained to and understohod all philosophy, all the sects of philosophers, all their founders and supporters, all their systems, all sorts of histories and studies. And for his wit, was he not so excellent, so grave, so forcible, that he scarce ever undertook the overthrow of any position, but either by quickness of wit he undermined, or by weight of reason he crushed it? Further, who is able to express the praises which his style of speech deserves, which is fraught (I know none like it) with that cogency of reason, that such as it cannot persuade it, it comples to assent; whose so many words almost are so many sentences; whose so many senses, so many victories? This know Marcion and Apelles, Praxeas and Hermogenes, Jews, Gentiles, Gnostics, and divers others, whose blasphemous opinions he hath overthrown with his many and great volumes, as it had been thunderbolts. And yet this man after all, this Tertullian, not retaining the Catholic doctrine-that is, the old faith-hath discredited with his later error his worthy writings," etc.-Chap. xxiv. (Oxford trans. Chap. xviii.) </p>
<p><a name="P157_30047"></a>
<sup>23 </sup>Neander's introduction to his <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Antignostikus</font></i> should be read in connection with this topic. He powerfully delineates the disposition of Tertullian and the character of Montanism, and attributes his seccession to that sect not to ourward causes, but to "his internal congeniality of mind." But, inasmuch as a man's subjective development is very much guided by circumstances, it is not necessary, in agreeing with Neander, to disbelieve some such account as Jerome has given us of Tertullian (Neander's <i><font face="Semitica Dict">Antignostikus</font></i>, etc. Bohn's trans., vol. ii. pp. 200-207).</p>

<sup>31 </sup>Here, again, our limits forbid a discussion; but the allusion to the Rhone having "scarcely yet lost the stain of blood" which we find in the <i>ad. Natt</i>. i. 17, compared with <i>Apol</i>. 35, seems to favour the idea of those who date the <i>ad. Natt</i>. earlier than the Apology, and consider the latter as a kind of new edition of the former: while it would fix the date of the <i>ad. Natt</i>. as not certainly earlier than 197, in which year (as we have seen) Albinus died. The fatal battle took place on the banks of the Rhone. </p>

<p><a name="P193_41308"></a>
<sup>36 </sup>Archdeacon Evans, in his <i>Biography of the Early Church</i> (in the Theological Library), suggests that the success which the <i>Apology</i> met with, or at least the fame it brought its author, may have been the occasion of Tertullian's visit to Rome. He rejects entirely the supposition that Tertullian was a presbyter of the Roman church; nor does he think Eusebius' words, <font face="SPIonic">kai\ tw=n ma/lista e0pi\  9Rw/mhj lamprw=n</font> (<i>Eccl. Hist</i>. ii. 2. 47. <i>ad fin</i>., 48 <i>ad init</i>.), sufficiently plain to be relied on. One thing does seem pretty plain, that the rendering of them which Rufinus gives, and Valesius follows, "inter nostros" (<i>sc.</i> Latinos) "Scriptores admodum clarus," cannot be correct. That we find a famous Roman lawyer Tertullianus, or Tertyllians, among the writer fragments of whom are preserved in the Pandects, Neander reminds us; but (as he says) it by no means follows, even if it could be proved that the date of the said lawyer corresponded with the supposed date of our Tertullian, that they were identical. Still it is worth bearing in mind, especially as a similarity of language exists, or has been thought to exist, between the jurist and the Christian author. And the juridical language and tone of our author do seem to point to his having -though Mr. Evans regards that as doubtful-been a trained lawyer.-Tr. </p>
