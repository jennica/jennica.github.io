<sup>164 </sup>Mr. Dodgson renders "celebrated the Eucharist;" but that rendering appears very doubtful. See Acts xxvii. 35.</p>
<p><a name="P12004_3347897"></a>
<sup>165 </sup>Mr. Dodgson supposes this word to mean "outward, as contrasted with the inward, `praying always.0'" Oehler interprets, "ex vita communi." But perhaps what Tertullian says lower down in the chapter, "albeit they stand <i>simply without any precept enjoining their observance</i>," may give us the true clue to his meaning; so that "extrinsecus" would = "extrinsic to any direct injunction of our Lord or His apostles." </p>
<p><a name="P12005_3348643"></a>
<sup>166 </sup>Acts ii. 1-4, 14, 15.</p>
<p><a name="P12006_3348749"></a>
<sup>167 </sup>Communitatis omnis (Oehler). Mr. Dodgson renders, "of every sort of common thing." Perhaps, as Routh suggests, we should read "omnium."</p>
<p><a name="P12007_3348926"></a>
<sup>168 </sup>Vasculo. But in Acts it is, <font face="SPIonic">skeu=o/j ti w9j o0qo/nhn mega/lhn</font> [<i>Small</i> is here comparatively used, with reference to <i>Universality</i> of which it was the symbol.]</p>
<p><a name="P12008_3349182"></a>
<sup>169 </sup>Acts x. 9.</p>
<p><a name="P12009_3349277"></a>
<sup>170 </sup>Acts iii. 1: but the man is not said to have been "paralytic," but "lame from his mother's womb."</p>

<p><a name="P12014_3350564"></a>
<sup>172 </sup>I have ventured to turn the first part of the sentence into a question. What "scripture" this may be, no one knows. [It seems to me a clear reference to Matt. xxv. 38, amplified by the 45th verse, in a way not unusual with our author.] Perhaps, in addition to the passages in Gen. xviii. and Heb. xiii. 2, to which the editors naturally refer, Tertullian may allude to such passages as Mark. ix. 37, Matt. xxv. 40, 45. [Christo in pauperibus.]</p>
<p><a name="P12015_3351137"></a>
<sup>173 </sup>I have followed Routh's conjecture, "feceris" for "fecerit," which Oehler does not even notice.</p>
<p><a name="P12016_3351367"></a>
<sup>174 </sup>Luke x. 5.</p>
<p><a name="P12020_3351598"></a>
<sup>175 </sup>Perhaps "the great Hallelujah," i.e. the last five psalms.</p>
<p><a name="P12021_3351890"></a>
<sup>176 </sup>[The author seems to have in mind (Hos. xiv. 2) "the calves of our lips."]</p>

<sup>177 </sup>1 Pet. ii. 5.</p>

<sup>182 </sup>Or, "provided."</p>
<p><a name="P12031_3353084"></a>
<sup>183 </sup>"<font face="Semitica Dict">Agape</font>," perhaps "the love-feast."</p>

<sup>186 </sup>Routh would read, "What <i>will</i> God <i>deny</i>?"</p>

<sup>187 </sup>Dan. iii.</p>
<p><a name="P12039_3353619"></a>
<sup>188 </sup>Dan. vi.</p>

<sup>189 </sup>1 Kings xviii.; Jas. v. 17, 18. </p>
<p><a name="P12041_3353854"></a>
<sup>190 </sup>i.e. "the angel who preserved in the furnace the three youths besprinkled, as it were, with dewy shower" (Muratori quoted by Oehler). [Apocrypha, <i>The Song</i>, etc., verses 26, 27.]</p>
<p><a name="P12042_3354104"></a>
<sup>191 </sup>2 Kings. iv. 42-44.</p>

<sup>200 </sup>As if in prayer.</p>
<p><a name="P12052_3356598"></a>
<sup>201 </sup>This beautiful passage should be supplemented by a similar one from St. Bernard: "Nonne et aviculas levat, non onerat penarum numerositas ipsa? Tolle eas, et reliquum corpus pondere suo fertur ad ima. Sic disciplinam Christi, sic suave jugum, sic onus leve, quo deponimus, eo deprimimur ipsi: quia portat potius quam portatur." Epistole, ccclxxxv. Bernardi Opp. Tom. i. p. 691. Ed. (Mabillon.) Guame, Paris, 1839. Bearing the cross uplifts the Christian.] </p>

<p><a name="P12064_3359477"></a>
<sup>3 </sup>[He favours this resource as sanctioned by custom, and gently persuades them, by agreeing as to its propriety, to bestow peace upon others. But, the foresight of thoes who objected was afterwards justified, for in Cyprian's day this practice led to greater evils, and he was obliged to discourage it (ep. xi.) in an epistle to confessors.] </p>
<p><a name="P12068_3361784"></a>
<sup>4 </sup>[Whom ministered to their fellow-Christians in prison, for the testimony of Jesus. What follows is a sad picture of social life among heathens.]</p>
