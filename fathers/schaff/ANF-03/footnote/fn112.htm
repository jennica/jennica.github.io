<sup>59 </sup>Such appears to be the meaning of this sentence as Oehler gives it. But the text is here corrupt; and it seems plain there must either be something lost relating to this "Achamoth," or else some capital error in the reading, or, thirdly, some gross and unaccountable confusion in the writer: for the sentence as it stands is wholly irreconcilable with what follows. It evidently makes "Achamoth" identical with "the thirtieth Aeon" above-named; and yet, without introducing any fresh subject, the writer goes on to state that this despondent Oeon, who "conceived and bare," was itself the offspring of despondency, and made an infirm world out of the infirm matierials which "Achamoth" supposed it with. Now it is apparent from other sources-as, for instance, from <i>Tert. adv. Valentin</i>, above referred to-that the "thirtieth Aeon" was supposed to be <i>female</i>, <i>Sophia</i> (Wisdom) by name, and that she was said to be <i>the parent</i> of "Achamoth," or "Enthymesis" (see <i>adv. Valentin.</i> cc. ix. x. xi. xiv. xxv.), while "Achamoth" herself appears by some accounts to be also called <font face="SPIonic">ka/tw Sofi/a</font>. The name "Achamoth" itself, which Tertullian (<i>adv. Valentin.</i> c. xiv. <i>ad init.</i>) calls an "uninterpretable name," is believed to be a representation of a Hebrew word meaning "wisdom;" and hence, possibly, some of the confusion may have arisen,-from the promiscuous use, namely, of the titles "Achamoth" and "Sophia," Moreover, it would appear that some words lower down as to the production by "Achamoth" of "Demiurgus," must have dropped out. Unless these two omissions be supplied, the passage is wholly unintelligible. Can the fact that the Hebrew word which "Achamoth" represents is a <i>fem. pl.</i> in any way explain this confused medley, or help to reconcile conflicting accounts? The <font face="SPIonic">a!nw</font> and <font face="SPIonic">ka/tw Sofi/a</font> seem to point in some degree to some such solution of some of the existing difficulties. "Iao," again, is a word which has cause much perplexity. Can it possibly be connected with <font face="SPIonic">i0a/omai</font>, "to heal?" [See note 8.]</p>

<p><a name="P11207_3178626"></a>
<sup>61 </sup>Oehler's suggestion is to vary the pointing so as to give this sense: "The resurrection of this flesh he denies. But of a sisterLaw and prophets," etc. But this seems even more harsh than the other.</p>

<sup>62 </sup>"Alter," i.e., perhaps another <i>of the same class</i>.</p>

<sup>65 </sup>Denique Jesum Christum decendisse. So Oehler, who does not notice any conjectural emendation, or various reading, of the words. If correct, his reading would refer to the views of a twofold Jesus Christ-a real and a phantasmal one-held by docetic Gnostics, or to such views as Velentine's, in whose system, so far as it is ascertainable from the confused and discrepant account of it, there would appear to have been one Aeon calle Christ, another called Jesus, and a human person calle dJesus and Christ, with whom the true Jesus associated Himself. Some such jumble of ideas the two heretics now under review would seem to have held, if Oehler's be the true reading. But the difficulties are somewhat lessened if we accept the very simple emendation which naturally suggests itself, and which, I see, Semler has proposed and Routh inclines to receive, "<i>in</i> Jesum Christum decendisse," i.e. "that Christ descended <i>on</i> Jesus."</p>

<sup>67 </sup>Habere <i>secum</i> numerum DCCCI. So Oehler, after Jos. Scaliger, who, however, seems to have read "<i>secum hunc</i> numerum," for the ordinary readnig, "habere <i>secundum</i> numerum," which would mean, "represnts, <i>in the way of</i> numerical value, DCCCI."</p>

<sup>88 </sup>See Heb. vii. 1-3.</p>
<p><a name="P11256_3189942"></a>
<sup>89 </sup>Who he is, no one knows. Oehler (following the lead of Fabricius on Philaster, cap. 49, p. 102) believes the name to be a mistake for Victor, a bishop of Rome, who (see <i>Adv. Prax.</i> c. i.) had held the episopate when Praxeas was there. His successor was Zephyrinus; and it is an ingenious conjecture of Oehler, that these two names, the one written as a correction of the other, may have been confused: thus, Victor/Zephrynus; and thus of the two may have been made Victorinus.</p>
