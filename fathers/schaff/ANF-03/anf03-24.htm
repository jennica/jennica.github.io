<font size="3">Chapter I.-Introductory. Heresies Must Exist, and Even Abound; They are a Probation to Faith.</font></p>
</ul><p>The character of the times in which we live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition, that we ought not to be astonished at the heresies (which abound)<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3132_1135045" id="P3132_1135045" name="P3132_1135045">2</a></sup> neither ought their existence to surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass;<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3133_1135152" id="P3133_1135152" name="P3133_1135152">3</a></sup> nor the fact that they subvert the faith of some, for their final cause is, by affording a trial to faith, to give it also the opportunity of being "approved."<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3134_1135377" id="P3134_1135377" name="P3134_1135377">4</a></sup> Groundless, therefore, and inconsiderate is the offence of the many<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3135_1135463" id="P3135_1135463" name="P3135_1135463">5</a></sup> who are scandalized by the very fact that heresies prevail to such a degree. How great (might their offence have been) if they had not existed.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3136_1135636" id="P3136_1135636" name="P3136_1135636">6</a></sup> When it has been determined that a thing must by all means be, it receives the (final) cause for which it has its being. This secures the power through which it exists, in such a way that it is impossible for it not to have existence.</p>

</ul><p>Taking the similar case<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3140_1136172" id="P3140_1136172" name="P3140_1136172">7</a></sup> of fever, which is appointed a place amongst all other deadly and excruciating issues (of life) for destroying man: we are not surprised either that it exists, for there it is, or that it consumes man, for that is the purpose of its existence. In like manner, with respect to heresies, which are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith, since we feel a dread because they have this power, we should first dread the fact of their existence; for as long as they exist, they have they have their power; and as long as they have their power, they, have their existence. But still fever, as being an evil both in its cause<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3141_1136868" id="P3141_1136868" name="P3141_1136868">8</a></sup> and in its power, as all know, we rather loathe than wonder at, and to the best of our power guard against, not having its extirpation in our power. Some men prefer wondering at heresies, however, which bring with them eternal death and the heat of a stronger fire, for possessing this power, instead of avoiding their power when they have the means of escape: but heresies would have no power, if (men) would cease to wonder that they have such power. For it either happens that, while men wonder, they fall into a snare, or, because they are ensnared, they cherish their surprise, as if heresies were so powerful because of some truth which belonged to them. It would no doubt be a wonderful thing that evil should have any force of its own, were it not that heresies are strong in those persons who are not strong in faith. In a combat of boxers and gladiators, generally speaking, it is not because a man is strong that he gains the victory, or loses it because he is not strong, but because he who is vanquished was a man of no strength; and indeed this very conqueror, when afterwards matched against a really powerful man, actually retires crest-fallen from the contest. In precisely the same way, heresies derive such strength as they have from the infirmities of individuals-having no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith.</p>

However,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3270_1158227" id="P3270_1158227" name="P3270_1158227">115</a></sup> there can be no indefinite seeking for that which has been taught as one only definite thing. You must "seek" until you "find," and believe when you have found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have believed provided you believe this besides, that nothing else is to be believed, and therefore nothing else is to be sought, after you have found and believed what has been taught by Him who charges you to seek no other thing than that which He has taught.<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3271_1158721" id="P3271_1158721" name="P3271_1158721">116</a></sup> When, indeed, any man doubts about this, proof will be forthcoming,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3272_1159111" id="P3272_1159111" name="P3272_1159111">117</a></sup> that we have in our possession<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3273_1159160" id="P3273_1159160" name="P3273_1159160">118</a></sup> that which was taught by Christ.

</ul><p>Now, with the view of branding<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3440_1187816" id="P3440_1187816" name="P3440_1187816">242</a></sup> the apostles with some mark of ignorance, they put forth the case of Peter and them that were with him having been rebuked by Paul.

(This they allege, ) in order that they may from this construct that other position of theirs, that a fuller knowledge may possibly have afterwards come over (the apostles, ) such as fell to the share of Paul when he rebuked those who preceded him. I may here say to those who reject <i>The Acts of the Apostles</i>: "It is first necessary that you shows us who this Paul was,-both what he was before he was an apostle, and how he became an apostle,"-so very great is the use which they make of him in respect of other questions also. It is true that he tells us himself that he was a persecutor before he became an apostle,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3441_1188644" id="P3441_1188644" name="P3441_1188644">243</a></sup> still this is not enough for any man who examines before he believes, since even the Lord Himself did not bear witness of Himself.<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3442_1188794" id="P3442_1188794" name="P3442_1188794">244</a></sup> But let them believe without the Scriptures, if their object is to believe contrary to the Scriptures.<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3443_1188916" id="P3443_1188916" name="P3443_1188916">245</a></sup> Still they should show, from the circumstance which they allege of Peter's being rebuked by Paul, that Paul added yet another form of the gospel besides that which Peter and the rest had previously set forth. But the fact is,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3444_1189179" id="P3444_1189179" name="P3444_1189179">246</a></sup> having been converted from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced as one of the brethren to brethren, by brethren-to them, indeed, by men who had put on faith from the apostles' hands. Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he "went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of seeing Peter,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3445_1189480" id="P3445_1189480" name="P3445_1189480">247</a></sup> because of his office, no doubt,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3446_1189532" id="P3446_1189532" name="P3446_1189532">248</a></sup> and by right of a common belief and preaching. Now they certainly would not have been surprised at his having become a preacher instead of a persecutor, if his preaching were of something contrary; nor, moreover, would they have "glorified the Lord,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3447_1189800" id="P3447_1189800" name="P3447_1189800">249</a></sup> because Paul had presented himself as an adversary to Him They accordingly even gave him "the right hand of fellowship,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3448_1189940" id="P3448_1189940" name="P3448_1189940">250</a></sup> as a sign of their agreement with him, and arranged amongst themselves a distribution of office, not a diversity of gospel, so that they should severally preach not a different gospel, but (the same), to different persons,<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3449_1190182" id="P3449_1190182" name="P3449_1190182">251</a></sup> Peter to the circumcision, Paul to the Gentiles. Forasmuch, then, as Peter was rebuked because, after he had lived with the Gentiles, he proceeded to separate himself from their company out of respect for persons, the fault surely was one of conversation, not of preaching.<sup><a href="footnote/fn34.htm#P3450_1190515" id="P3450_1190515" name="P3450_1190515">252</a></sup> For it does not appear from this, that any other God than the Creator, or any other Christ than (the son) of Mary, or any other hope than the resurrection, was (by him) announced.</p>

For this reason, then, no one ought to doubt, either that "spiritual wickednesses," from which also heresies come, have been introduced by the devil, or that there is any real difference between heresies and idolatry, seeing that they appertain both to the same author and the same work that idolatry does. They either pretend that there is another god in opposition to the Creator, or, even if they acknowledge that the Creator is the one only God, they treat of Him as a different being from what He is in truth. The consequence is, that every lie which they speak of God is in a certain sense a sort of idolatry</p>

</ul><p>But what shall I say concerning the ministry of the word, since they make it their business not to convert the heathen, but to subvert our people? This is rather the glory which they catch at, to compass the fall of those who stand, not the raising of those who are down. Accordingly, since the very work which they purpose to themselves comes not from the building up of their own society, but from the demolition of the truth, they undermine our edifices, that they may erect their own. Only deprive them of the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the divinity of the Creator, and they have not another objection to talk about. The consequence is, that they more easily accomplish the ruin of standing houses than the erection of fallen ruins. It is only when they have such objects in view that they show themselves humble and bland and respectful. Otherwise they know no respect even for their own leaders. Hence it is [supposed] that schisms seldom happen among heretics, because, even when they exist, they are not obvious.<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3695_1241496" id="P3695_1241496" name="P3695_1241496">440</a></sup> Their very unity, however,<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3696_1241542" id="P3696_1241542" name="P3696_1241542">441</a></sup> is schism. I am greatly in error if they do not amongst themselves swerve even from their own regulations, forasmuch as every man, just as it suits his own temper, modifies the traditions he has received after the same fashion as the man who handed them down did, when he moulded them according to his own will. The progress of the matter is an acknowledgment at once of its character and of the manner of its birth. That was allowable to the Valentinians which had been allowed to Valentinus; that was also fair for the Marcionites which had been done by Marcion-even to innovate on the faith, as was agreeable to their own pleasure. In short, all heresies, when thoroughly looked into, are detected harbouring dissent in many particulars even from their own founders. The majority of them have not even churches.<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3697_1242427" id="P3697_1242427" name="P3697_1242427">442</a></sup> Motherless, houseless, creedless, outcasts, they wander about in their own essential worthlessness.<sup><a href="footnote/fn36.htm#P3698_1242739" id="P3698_1242739" name="P3698_1242739">443</a></sup> </p>

Where, however is God not feared, except where He <i>is</i> not? Where God is not, there truth also is not. Where there is no truth, then, naturally enough, there is also such a discipline as theirs.

As if this caution were not also in the written record: that many should come who were to work even the greatest miracles, in defence of the deceit of their corrupt preaching.
