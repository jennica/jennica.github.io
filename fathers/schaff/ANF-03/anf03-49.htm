There is absolutely nothing which makes men's minds more obdurate than the simplicity of the divine works which are visible in the <i>act</i>, when compared with the grandeur which is promised thereto in the <i>effect</i>; so that from the very fact, that with so great simplicity, without pomp, without any considerable novelty of preparation, finally, without expense, a man is dipped in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent attainment of eternity<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11479_3248171" id="P11479_3248171" name="P11479_3248171">5</a></sup> is esteemed the more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on the contrary, it is not from their circumstance, and preparation, and expense, that <i>idols</i>' solemnities or mysteries get their credit and authority built up. Oh, miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties, simplicity and power! What then? Is it not wonderful, too, that death should be washed away by bathing? But it is the more to be believed if the wonderfulness be the reason why it is <i>not</i> believed. For what does it behove divine works to be in their quality, except that they be above all wonder?<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11480_3248782" id="P11480_3248782" name="P11480_3248782">6</a></sup> We also ourselves wonder, but it is <i>because</i> we believe.

For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11493_3251172" id="P11493_3251172" name="P11493_3251172">16</a></sup> alone-always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself-supplied a worthy vehicle to God. What <i>of the fact</i> that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by God? For the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by "dividing the waters; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11494_3251535" id="P11494_3251535" name="P11494_3251535">17</a></sup> the suspension of "the dry land" He accomplished by "separating the waters." After the world had been hereupon set in order through <i>its</i> elements, when inhabitants were given it, "the waters" were the first to receive the precept "to bring forth living creatures."<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11495_3251821" id="P11495_3251821" name="P11495_3251821">18</a></sup> Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in baptism if waters know how to give life.<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11496_3251957" id="P11496_3251957" name="P11496_3251957">19</a></sup> For was not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters? Suitable material is found in the <i>earth</i>, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) "the waters," separated the fourth day before into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the evidences of the "authority" of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of baptism; although I should <i>thereby</i> teach all the more fully, that it is not to be doubted that God has made the <i>material substance</i> which He has disposed throughout all His products<sup><a href="footnote/fn114.htm#P11497_3252864" id="P11497_3252864" name="P11497_3252864">20</a></sup> and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar sacraments; that the material substance which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.</p>

</ul><p>But it will suffice to have <i>thus</i> called at the outset those points in which withal is recognised that primary principle of baptism,-which was even then fore-noted by the very attitude <i>assumed</i> for a type of baptism,-that the Spirit of God, who hovered over (the waters) from the beginning, would continue to linger over the waters of the baptized.<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11501_3253598" id="P11501_3253598" name="P11501_3253598">21</a></sup> But a holy thing, of course, hovered over a holy; or else, from that which hovered over that which <i>was</i> hovered over borrowed a holiness, since it is necessary that in every case an underlying material substance should catch the quality of that which overhangs it, most of all a corporeal of a spiritual, adapted (as the spiritual is) through the subtleness of its substance, both for penetrating and insinuating. Thus the nature of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let no one say, "Why then, are we, pray, baptized with the very waters which then existed in the first beginning? "Not with those waters, of course, except in so far as the <i>genus</i> indeed is one, but the <i>species</i> very many. But what is an attribute to the <i>genus</i> reappears<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11502_3254407" id="P11502_3254407" name="P11502_3254407">22</a></sup> likewise in the <i>species</i>. And accordingly it makes no difference whether a man be washed in a sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a lake or a trough;<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11503_3254573" id="P11503_3254573" name="P11503_3254573">23</a></sup> nor is there any distinction between those whom John baptized in the Jordan and those whom Peter baptized in the Tiber, unless withal the eunuch whom Philip baptized in the midst of his journeys with chance water, derived (therefrom) more or less of salvation <i>than others</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11504_3254853" id="P11504_3254853" name="P11504_3254853">24</a></sup> All waters, therefore, in virtue of the pristine privilege of their origin, do, after invocation of God, attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for the Spirit immediately supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters, sanctifying them from Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at the same time the power of sanctifying. Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by sins, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as sins do not show themselves in our <i>flesh</i> (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of idolatry, or fornication, or fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the <i>spirit</i>, which is the author of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of command; the flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters have been in a manner endued with medicinal virtue<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11505_3255847" id="P11505_3255847" name="P11505_3255847">25</a></sup> through the intervention of the angel,<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11506_3255902" id="P11506_3255902" name="P11506_3255902">26</a></sup> the spirit is corporeally washed in the waters, and the flesh is in the same spiritually cleansed.</p>

</ul><p>"Well, but the nations, who are strangers to all understanding of spiritual powers, ascribe to their idols the imbuing of waters with the self-same efficacy."

The gods themselves likewise they honour by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they everywhere expiate<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11512_3256726" id="P11512_3256726" name="P11512_3256726">29</a></sup> country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities: at all events, at the Apollinarian and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they presume that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the penalties due to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, whoever had defiled himself with murder, was wont to go in quest of purifying waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service through the authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil rivalling the things of God,<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11513_3257652" id="P11513_3257652" name="P11513_3257652">30</a></sup> while we find him, too, practising baptism in his <i>subjects</i>. What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the faith; if they put no trust in the things of God, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11514_3258269" id="P11514_3258269" name="P11514_3258269">31</a></sup> of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning?

Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too hard <i>for belief</i> that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man's salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida.<sup><a href="footnote/fn115.htm#P11519_3259258" id="P11519_3259258" name="P11519_3259258">36</a></sup> They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain.

Of course, his words are not so to be understood, but as simply spoken after an ordinary manner; just as, for instance, we say, "The emperor set forth an edict," or, "The prefect cudgelled him." Pray does the emperor in person set forth, or the prefect in person cudgel? One whose ministers do a thing is always said to do it.<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11616_3273843" id="P11616_3273843" name="P11616_3273843">114</a></sup> So "He will baptize you" will have to be understood as standing for, "Through Him," or" Into Him," "you will be baptized." But let not (the fact) that "He Himself baptized not" trouble any. For into whom should He baptize? Into repentance? Of what use, then, do you make His forerunner? Into remission of sins, which He used to give by a word? Into Himself, whom by humility He was concealing? Into the Holy Spirit, who had not yet descended from the Father? Into the Church, which His apostles had not yet founded? And thus it was with the selfsame "baptism of John" that His disciples used to baptize, as ministers, with which John before had baptized as forerunner. Let none think it was with some other, because no other exists, except that of Christ subsequently; which at that time, of course, could not be given by His disciples, inasmuch as the glory of the Lord had not yet been fully attained,<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11617_3274854" id="P11617_3274854" name="P11617_3274854">115</a></sup> nor the efficacy of the font<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11618_3274916" id="P11618_3274916" name="P11618_3274916">116</a></sup> established through the passion and the resurrection; because neither can our death see dissolution except by the Lord's passion, nor our life be restored without His resurrection.</p>

</ul><p>When, however, the prescript is laid down that "without baptism, salvation is attainable by none" (chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says, "Unless one be born of water, he hath not life"<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11622_3275379" id="P11622_3275379" name="P11622_3275379">117</a></sup> ), there arise immediately scrupulous, nay rather audacious, doubts on the part of some, "how, in accordance with that prescript, salvation is attainable by the apostles, whom-Paul excepted-we do not find baptized in the Lord? Nay, since Paul is the only one of them who has put on <i>the garment of</i> Christ's baptism,<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11623_3275731" id="P11623_3275731" name="P11623_3275731">118</a></sup> either the peril of all the others who lack the water of Christ is prejudged, that the prescript may be maintained, or else the prescript is rescinded if salvation has been ordained even for the unbaptized." I have heard-the Lord is my witness-doubts of that kind: that none may imagine me so abandoned as to ex-cogitate, unprovoked, in the licence of my pen, ideas which would inspire others with scruple.</p>
<p>And now, as far as I shall be able, I will reply to them who affirm "that the apostles were unbaptized." For if they had undergone the human baptism of John, and were longing for that of the Lord, <i>then</i> since the Lord Himself had defined baptism to be <i>one</i>;<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11625_3276418" id="P11625_3276418" name="P11625_3276418">119</a></sup> (saying to Peter, who was desirous<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11626_3276476" id="P11626_3276476" name="P11626_3276476">120</a></sup> of being thoroughly bathed, "He who hath once bathed hath no necessity <i>to wash</i> a second time; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11627_3276692" id="P11627_3276692" name="P11627_3276692">121</a></sup> which, of course, He would not have said at all to one <i>not</i> baptized; ) even here we have a conspicuous<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11628_3276820" id="P11628_3276820" name="P11628_3276820">122</a></sup> proof against those who, in order to destroy the sacrament of water, deprive the apostles even of John's baptism. Can it seem credible that "the way of the Lord," that is, the baptism of John, had not then been "prepared "in those persons who were being destined to <i>open</i> the way of the Lord throughout the whole world? The Lord Himself, though no "repentance" was due from <i>Him</i>, was baptized: was baptism not necessary for <i>sinners</i>? As for the fact, then, that "others were not baptized"-they, however, were not companions of Christ, but enemies of the faith, doctors of the law and Pharisees. From which fact is gathered an additional suggestion, that, since the <i>opposers</i> of the Lord <i>refused</i> to be baptized, they who <i>followed</i> the Lord <i>were</i> baptized, and were not like-minded with their own rivals: especially when, if there were any one to whom they clave, the Lord had exalted John above him (by the testimony) saying," Among them who are born of women <i>there is</i> none greater than John the Baptist."<sup><a href="footnote/fn116.htm#P11629_3277887" id="P11629_3277887" name="P11629_3277887">123</a></sup> </p>
