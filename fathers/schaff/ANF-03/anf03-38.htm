</ul><p>The Valentinians, who are no doubt a very large body of heretics-comprising as they do so many apostates from the truth, who have a propensity for fables, and no discipline to deter them (therefrom) care for nothing so much as to obscure<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8792_2448991" id="P8792_2448991" name="P8792_2448991">1</a></sup> what they preach, if indeed they (can be said to) preach who obscure <i>their doctrine</i>. The officiousness with which they guard their doctrine is an officiousness which betrays their guilt.<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8793_2449340" id="P8793_2449340" name="P8793_2449340">2</a></sup> Their disgrace is proclaimed in the very earnestness with which they maintain their religious system. Now, in the case of those Eleusinian mysteries, which are the very heresy of Athenian superstition, it is their secrecy that is their disgrace. Accordingly, they previously beset all access to their body with tormenting conditions;<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8794_2449957" id="P8794_2449957" name="P8794_2449957">3</a></sup> <i>and</i> they require a long initiation before they enrol (their members),<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8795_2450056" id="P8795_2450056" name="P8795_2450056">4</a></sup> even instruction during five years for their perfect disciples,<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8796_2450144" id="P8796_2450144" name="P8796_2450144">5</a></sup> in order that they may mould<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8797_2450213" id="P8797_2450213" name="P8797_2450213">6</a></sup> their opinions by this suspension of full knowledge, and apparently raise the dignity of their mysteries in proportion to the craving for them which they have previously created. Then follows the duty of silence. Carefully is that guarded, which is so long in finding. All the divinity, however, lies in their secret recesses:<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8798_2450555" id="P8798_2450555" name="P8798_2450555">7</a></sup> there are revealed <i>at last</i> all the aspirations of the fully initiated,<sup><a href="footnote/fn87.htm#P8799_2450637" id="P8799_2450637" name="P8799_2450637">8</a></sup> the entire mystery of the sealed tongue, the symbol of virility.

If you propose to them inquiries sincere and honest, they answer you with stern<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8808_2451836" id="P8808_2451836" name="P8808_2451836">17</a></sup> look and contracted brow, and say, "The subject is profound." If you try them with subtle questions, with the ambiguities of their double tongue, they affirm a community of faith (with yourself). If you intimate to them that you understand <i>their opinions</i>, they insist on knowing nothing themselves. If you come to a close engagement with them they destroy your own fond hope of a victory over them by a self-immolation.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8809_2452272" id="P8809_2452272" name="P8809_2452272">18</a></sup> Not even to their own disciples do they commit a secret before they have made sure of them. They have the knack of persuading men before instructing them; although truth persuades by teaching, but does not teach by first persuading.</p>

Most perverse, however, are they who are not simple, even as they are most foolish who are not wise.

Besides, the face of the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8817_2453599" id="P8817_2453599" name="P8817_2453599">23</a></sup> is patiently waited for by those who "seek Him in simplicity of heart," as says the very Wisdom-not of Valentinus, but-of Solomon.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8818_2453747" id="P8818_2453747" name="P8818_2453747">24</a></sup> Then, again, infants have borne<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8819_2453804" id="P8819_2453804" name="P8819_2453804">25</a></sup> by their blood a testimony to Christ.

In brief, "the dove" has usually served to figure Christ; "the serpent," to tempt Him. The one even from the first has been the harbinger of divine peace; the other from the beginning has been the despoiler of the divine image. Accordingly, simplicity alone<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8824_2454825" id="P8824_2454825" name="P8824_2454825">30</a></sup> will be more easily able to know and to declare God, <i>whereas</i> wisdom alone will rather do Him violence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8825_2454955" id="P8825_2454955" name="P8825_2454955">31</a></sup> and betray Him.</p>

Deservedly, therefore, must they be regarded as wanting in simplicity, and as merely prudent, who produce such fables not without difficulty, and defend them only indirectly, who at the same time do not thoroughly instruct those whom they teach. This, of course, shows their astuteness, if their lessons are disgraceful; their unkindness, if they are honourable. As for us, however, who are the simple folk, we know all about it. In short, this is the very first weapon with which we are armed for our encounter; it unmasks<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8840_2458639" id="P8840_2458639" name="P8840_2458639">43</a></sup> and brings to view<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8841_2458675" id="P8841_2458675" name="P8841_2458675">44</a></sup> the whole of their depraved system.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8842_2458730" id="P8842_2458730" name="P8842_2458730">45</a></sup> And in this we have the first augury of our victory; because even merely to point out that which is concealed with so great an outlay of artifice,<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8843_2458911" id="P8843_2458911" name="P8843_2458911">46</a></sup> is to destroy it.</p>

</ul><p>We know, I say, most fully their actual origin, and we are quite aware why we call them Valentinians, although they affect to disavow their name. They have departed, it is true,<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8847_2459334" id="P8847_2459334" name="P8847_2459334">47</a></sup> from their founder, yet is their origin by no means destroyed; and even if it chance to be changed, the very change bears testimony to the fact. Valentinus had expected to become a bishop, because he was an able man both in genius and eloquence. Being indignant, however, that another obtained the dignity by reason of a claim which confessorship<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8848_2459692" id="P8848_2459692" name="P8848_2459692">48</a></sup> had given him, he broke with the church of the true faith. Just like those (restless) spirits which, when roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge, he applied himself with all his might<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8849_2459920" id="P8849_2459920" name="P8849_2459920">49</a></sup> to exterminate the truth; and finding the clue<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8850_2459983" id="P8850_2459983" name="P8850_2459983">50</a></sup> of a certain old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of a serpent. Ptolemµus afterwards entered on the same path, by distinguishing the names and the numbers of the ¦nons into personal substances, which, however, he kept apart from God. Valentinus had included these in the very essence of the Deity, as senses and affections of motion. Sundry bypaths were then struck off therefrom, by Heraclean and Secundus and the magician Marcus. Theotimus worked hard about "the images of the law." Valentinus, however, was as yet nowhere, and still the Valentinians derive their name from Valentinus. Axionicus at Antioch is the only man who at the present time does honour<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8851_2460685" id="P8851_2460685" name="P8851_2460685">51</a></sup> to the memory of Valentinus, by keeping his rules<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8852_2460752" id="P8852_2460752" name="P8852_2460752">52</a></sup> to the full. But this heresy is permitted to fashion itself into as many various shapes as a courtezan, who usually changes and adjusts her dress every day. And why not? When they review that spiritual seed of theirs in every man after this fashion, whenever they have hit upon any novelty, they forthwith call their presumption a revelation, their own perverse ingenuity a spiritual gift; but (they deny all) unity, <i>admitting only</i> diversity.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8853_2461362" id="P8853_2461362" name="P8853_2461362">53</a></sup> And thus we clearly see that, setting aside their customary dissimulation, most of them are in a divided state, being ready to say (and that sincerely) of certain points of their belief, "This is not so; "and, "I take this in a different sense; "and, "I do not admit that." By this variety, indeed, innovation is stamped on the very face of their rules; besides which, it wears all the colourable features of ignorant conceits.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8854_2461844" id="P8854_2461844" name="P8854_2461844">54</a></sup> </p>

Nor shall we hear it said of us from any quarter, that we have of our own mind fashioned our own materials, since these have been already produced, both in respect of the opinions and their refutations, in carefully written volumes, by so many eminently holy and excellent men, not only those who have lived before us, but those also who were contemporary with the heresiarchs themselves: for instance Justin, philosopher and martyr;<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8860_2462613" id="P8860_2462613" name="P8860_2462613">57</a></sup> Miltiades, the sophist<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8861_2462682" id="P8861_2462682" name="P8861_2462682">58</a></sup> of the churches Irenµus, that very exact inquirer into all doctrines;<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8862_2462806" id="P8862_2462806" name="P8862_2462806">59</a></sup> our own Proculus, the model<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8863_2463000" id="P8863_2463000" name="P8863_2463000">60</a></sup> of chaste old age and Christian eloquence. All these it would be my desire closely to follow in every work of faith, even as in this particular one. Now if there are no heresies at all but what those who refute them are supposed to have fabricated, then the apostle who predicted them<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8864_2463336" id="P8864_2463336" name="P8864_2463336">61</a></sup> must have been guilty of falsehood.

Now the rendering of some of these <i>names</i> from the Greek to as to produce an equally obvious sense of the word, is by no means an easy process: in the case of some others, the genders, are not suitable; while others, again, are more familiarly known in their Greek form. For the most part, therefore, we shall use the Greek names; their meanings will be seen on the margins of the pages. Nor will the Greek be unaccompanied with the Latin <i>equivalents</i>; only these will be marked in lines above, for the purpose of explaining<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8871_2464686" id="P8871_2464686" name="P8871_2464686">65</a></sup> the personal names, rendered necessary by the ambiguities of such of them as admit some different meaning.

If in any instance mirth be excited, this will be quite as much as the subject deserves. There are many things which deserve refutation in such a way as to have no gravity expended on them. Vain and silly topics are met with especial fitness by laughter. Even the truth may indulge in ridicule, because it is jubilant; it may play with its enemies, because it is fearless.<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8875_2465686" id="P8875_2465686" name="P8875_2465686">69</a></sup> 0nly we must take care that its laughter be not unseemly, and so itself be laughed at; but wherever its mirth is decent, there it is a duty <i>to indulge it</i>.

As for <i>our</i> heretics, however, it is marvellous what storeys upon storeys<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8881_2466349" id="P8881_2466349" name="P8881_2466349">72</a></sup> and what heights upon heights, they have hung up, raised <i>and</i> spread out as a dwelling for each several god of theirs. Even our Creator has had arranged for Him the saloons of Ennius in the fashion of private rooms,<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8882_2466596" id="P8882_2466596" name="P8882_2466596">73</a></sup> with chamber piled upon chamber, and assigned to each god by just as many staircases as there were heresies. The universe, <i>in fact</i>, has been turned into "rooms to let."<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8883_2466783" id="P8883_2466783" name="P8883_2466783">74</a></sup> Such storeys of the heavens you would imagine to be detached tenements in some happy isle of the blessed,<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8884_2466906" id="P8884_2466906" name="P8884_2466906">75</a></sup> I know not where. There the god even of the Valentinians has his dwelling in the attics. They call him indeed, as to his essence, <font face="SPIonic">Ai0w=n te/leoj</font> (<i>Perfect ¦on</i>), but in respect of his personality, <font face="SPIonic">Proarxh/</font> (<i>Before the Beginning</i>), <font face="SPIonic"> 9H'Arkh/</font> (The Beginning), and sometimes Bythos (<i>Depth</i>),<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8885_2467475" id="P8885_2467475" name="P8885_2467475">76</a></sup> a name which is most unfit for one who dwells in the heights above! They describe him as unbegotten, immense, infinite, invisible, and eternal; as if, when they described him to be such as we know that he ought to be, they straightway prove him to be a being who may be said to have had such an existence even before all things else. I indeed insist upon<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8886_2467977" id="P8886_2467977" name="P8886_2467977">77</a></sup> it that he is such a being; and there is nothing which I detect in beings of this sort more obvious, than that they who are said to have been before all things-things, too, not their own-are found to be behind all things. Let it, however, be granted that this Bythos of theirs existed in the infinite ages of the past in the greatest and profoundest repose, in the extreme rest of a placid and, if I may use the expression, stupid divinity, such as Epicurus has enjoined upon us. And yet, although they would have him be alone, they assign to him a second person in himself and with himself, Ennoea (<i>Thought</i>), which they also call both Charis (<i>Grace</i>) and Sige (<i>Silence</i>). Other things, as it happened, conduced in this most agreeable repose to remind him of the need of by and by producing out of himself the beginning of all things. This he deposits in lieu of seed in the genital region, as it were, of the womb of his Sige. Instantaneous conception is the result: Sige becomes pregnant, and is delivered, of course in silence; and her offspring is Nus (Mind), very like his father and his equal in every respect. In short, he alone is capable of comprehending the measureless and incomprehensible greatness of his father. Accordingly he is even called the Father himself, and the Beginning of all things, and, with great propriety, Monogenes (<i>The Only-begotten</i>). And yet not with absolute propriety, since he is not born alone. For along with him a female also proceeded, whose name was Veritas<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8887_2469526" id="P8887_2469526" name="P8887_2469526">78</a></sup> (<i>Truth</i>). But how much more suitably might Monogenes be called Protogenes (<i>First begotten</i>), since he was begotten first! Thus Bythos and Sige, Nus. and Veritas, are alleged to be the first fourfold team<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8888_2469838" id="P8888_2469838" name="P8888_2469838">79</a></sup> of the Valentinian set (of gods)<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8889_2469886" id="P8889_2469886" name="P8889_2469886">80</a></sup> the parent stock and origin of them all. For immediately when<sup><a href="footnote/fn88.htm#P8890_2469964" id="P8890_2469964" name="P8890_2469964">81</a></sup> Nus received the function of a procreation of his own, he too produces out of himself Sermo (<i>the Word</i>) and Vita (<i>the Life</i>). If this latter existed not previously, of course she existed not in Bythos. And a pretty absurdity would it be, if <i>Life</i> existed not in God! However, this offspring also produces fruit, having for its mission the initiation of the universe and the formation of the entire Pleroma: it procreates Homo (<i>Man</i>) and Ecclesia (<i>the Church</i>).

To be sure, Nus, so far as in him lay, both wished and tried to impart to the others also all that he had learnt about the greatness and incomprehensibility of the Father; but his mother, Sige, interposed-she who (you must know) imposes silence even on her own beloved heretics;<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8919_2475300" id="P8919_2475300" name="P8919_2475300">104</a></sup> although they affirm that this is done at the will of the Father, who will have all to be inflamed with a longing after himself. Thus, while they are tormenting themselves with these internal desires, while they are burning with the secret longing to know the Father, the crime is almost accomplished. For of the twelve ¦ons which Homo and Ecclesia had produced, the youngest by birth (never mind the solecism, since Sophia (Wisdom) is her name), unable to restrain herself, breaks away without the society of her husband Theletus, in quest of the Father and contracts that kind of sin which had indeed arisen amongst the others who were conversant with Nus but had flowed on to this <i>¦on</i>,<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8920_2476105" id="P8920_2476105" name="P8920_2476105">105</a></sup> that is, to Sophia; as is usual with maladies which, after arising in one part of the body, spread abroad their infection to some other limb. The fact is,<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8921_2476286" id="P8921_2476286" name="P8921_2476286">106</a></sup> under a pretence of love to the Father, she was overcome with a desire to rival Nus, who alone rejoiced in the knowledge of the Father.<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8922_2476439" id="P8922_2476439" name="P8922_2476439">107</a></sup> But when Sophia, straining after impossible aims, was disappointed of her hope, she is both overcome with difficulty, and racked with affection. <i>Thus</i> she was all but swallowed up by reason of the charm and toil (of her research),<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8923_2476686" id="P8923_2476686" name="P8923_2476686">108</a></sup> and dissolved into the remnant of <i>his</i> substance;<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8924_2476773" id="P8924_2476773" name="P8924_2476773">109</a></sup> nor would there have been any other alternative for her than perdition, if she had not by good luck fallen in with Horus (<i>Limit</i>).

After her vain endeavours, and the disappointment of her hope, she was, I suppose, disfigured with paleness and emaciation, and that neglect of her beauty which was natural to one who<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8932_2478340" id="P8932_2478340" name="P8932_2478340">114</a></sup> was deploring the denial of the Father,-an affliction which was no less painful than his loss. Then, in the midst of all this sorrow, she by herself alone, without any conjugal help, conceived and bare a female offspring. Does this excite your surprise? Well, even the hen has the power of being able to bring forth by her own energy.<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8933_2478692" id="P8933_2478692" name="P8933_2478692">115</a></sup> They say, too, that among vultures there are only females, which become parents alone.

Remedies <i>could</i> nowhere <i>be found</i>. For where, then, should we have tragedies and comedies, from which to borrow the process of exposing what has been born without connubial modesty? While the thing is in this evil plight, she raises her eyes, and turns them to the Father. Having, however, striven in vain, as her strength was failing her, she falls to praying. Her entire kindred also supplicates in her behalf, and especially Nus. Why not? What was the cause of so vast an evil?

They also go on to tell us that Horos is likewise called Metagogius, that is, "a conductor about," as well as Horothetes (<i>Setter of Limits</i>). By his assistance they declare that Sophia was checked in her illicit courses, and purified from all evils, and henceforth strengthened (in virtue), and restored to the conjugal state: (they add) that she indeed remained within the bounds<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8938_2480611" id="P8938_2480611" name="P8938_2480611">120</a></sup> of the Pleroma, but that her Enthymesis, with the accruing<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8939_2480687" id="P8939_2480687" name="P8939_2480687">121</a></sup> Passion, was banished by Horos, and crucified and cast out from the Pleroma,-even as they say, <i>Malum foras</i>!

One divinity is assigned in the case of all these, to procure a complete adjustment among the ¦ons.

Well, I will even grant them what they allege about knowing the Father, so that they do not refuse us (the attainment of) the same. I would rather point out what is perverse in their doctrine, how they were taught that the incomprehensible part of the Father was the cause of their own perpetuity,<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8953_2483268" id="P8953_2483268" name="P8953_2483268">132</a></sup> whilst that which might be comprehended of him was the reason<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8954_2483413" id="P8954_2483413" name="P8954_2483413">133</a></sup> of their generation and formation. Now by these several positions<sup><a href="footnote/fn89.htm#P8955_2483517" id="P8955_2483517" name="P8955_2483517">134</a></sup> the tenet, I suppose, is insinuated, that it is expedient for God not to be apprehended, on the very ground that the incomprehensibility of His character is the cause of perpetuity; whereas what in Him is comprehensible is productive, not of perpetuity, but rather of conditions which lack perpetuity-namely, nativity and formation. The Son, indeed, they made capable of comprehending the Father. The manner in which He is comprehended, the recently produced Christ fully taught them. To the Holy Spirit, however, belonged the special gifts, whereby they, having been all set on a complete par in respect of their earnestness to learn, should be enabled to offer up their thanksgiving, and be introduced to a true tranquillity.</p>

For, after he had made the world, the Demiurge turns his hands to man, and chooses for him as his substance not any portion of "the dry land," as they say, of which alone we have any knowledge (although it was, at that time, not yet dried by the waters becoming separated from the earthy residuum, and only afterwards became dry), but of the invisible substance of that matter, which philosophy indeed dreams of, from its fluid and fusible composition, the origin of which I am unable to imagine, because it exists nowhere. Now, since fluidity and fusibility are qualities Of liquid matter, and since everything liquid flowed from Sophia's tears, we must, as a necessary conclusion, believe that muddy earth is constituted of Sophia's eye-rheums and viscid discharges,<sup><a href="footnote/fn90.htm#P9094_2510937" id="P9094_2510937" name="P9094_2510937">234</a></sup> which are just as much the dregs of tears as mud is the sediment of waters.

As regards the spiritual, however, (they say) that it enters into the formation of the animal, in order that it may be educated in company with it and be disciplined by repeated intercourse with it. For the animal (nature) was in want of training even by the senses: for this purpose, accordingly, was the whole structure of the world provided; for this purpose also did Soter (<i>the Saviour</i>) present Himself in the world-even for the salvation of the animal (nature).

<font size="3">Chapter XXXII.-Indignant Irony Exposing the Valentinian Fable About the Judicial Treatment of Mankind at the Last Judgment. The Immorality of the Doctrine.</font></p>
</ul><p>As for the human race, its end will be to the following effect:-To all which bear the earthy<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9176_2526264" id="P9176_2526264" name="P9176_2526264">292</a></sup> and material mark there accrues an entire destruction, because "all flesh is grass,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9177_2526375" id="P9177_2526375" name="P9177_2526375">293</a></sup> and amongst these is the soul of moral man, except when it has found salvation by faith. The souls of just men, that is to say, our souls, will be conveyed to the Demiurge in the abodes of the middle region. We are duly thankful; we shall be content to be classed with our god, in whom lies our own origin.<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9178_2526701" id="P9178_2526701" name="P9178_2526701">294</a></sup> Into the palace of the Pleroma nothing of the animal nature is admitted-nothing but the spiritual swarm of Valentinus. There, then, the first process is the despoiling of men themselves, that is, men within the Pleroma.<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9179_2526960" id="P9179_2526960" name="P9179_2526960">295</a></sup> Now this despoiling consists of the putting off of the souls in which they appear to be clothed, which they will give back to their Demiurge as they had obtained<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9180_2527141" id="P9180_2527141" name="P9180_2527141">296</a></sup> them from him.

They will be dispersed amongst the angels, the attendants on Soter. As sons, do you suppose? Not at all. As servants, then? No, not even so. Well, as phantoms? Would that it were nothing more! Then in what capacity, if you are ashamed to tell us? In the capacity of brides. Then will they end<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9184_2527771" id="P9184_2527771" name="P9184_2527771">300</a></sup> their Sabine rapes with the sanction of wedlock. This will be the guerdon of the spiritual, this the recompense of their faith! Such fables have their use. Although but a Marcus or a Gaius,<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9185_2527978" id="P9185_2527978" name="P9185_2527978">301</a></sup> full-grown in this flesh of ours, with a beard and such like proofs (of virility, ) it may be a stern husband, a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather (never mind what, in fact, if only a male), you may perhaps in the bridal-chamber of the Pleroma-I have already said so tacitly<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9186_2528290" id="P9186_2528290" name="P9186_2528290">302</a></sup> -even become the parent by an angel of some ¦on of high numerical rank.<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9187_2528491" id="P9187_2528491" name="P9187_2528491">303</a></sup> For the right celebration of these nuptials, instead of the torch and veil, I suppose that secret fire is then to burst forth, which, after devastating the whole existence of things, will itself also be reduced to nothing at last, after everything has been reduced to ashes; and so their fable too will be ended.<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9188_2529040" id="P9188_2529040" name="P9188_2529040">304</a></sup> But I, too, am no doubt a rash man, in having exposed: so great a mystery in so derisive a way: I ought to be afraid that Achamoth, who did not choose to make herself known even to her own son, would turn mad, that Theletus would be enraged, that Fortune<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9189_2529460" id="P9189_2529460" name="P9189_2529460">305</a></sup> would be irritated. But I am yet a liege-man of the Demiurge. I have to return after death to the place where there is no more giving in marriage, where I have to be clothed upon rather than to be despoiled,-where, even if I am despoiled of my sex, I am Glassed with angels-not a male angel, nor a female one. There will be no one to do aught against me, nor will they then find any male energy in me.</p>

For there have been in his school "disciples above their master," who have attributed to their Bythus two wives-Cogitatio (<i>Thought</i>) and Voluntas (<i>Will</i>). For Cogitatio alone was not sufficient wherewith to produce any offspring, although from the two wives procreation was most easy to him. The former bore him Monogenes (<i>Only-Begotten</i>) and Veritas (<i>Truth</i>). Veritas was a female after the likeness of Cogitatio; Monogenes a male bearing a resemblance to Voluntas. For it is the strength of Voluntas which procures the masculine nature,<sup><a href="footnote/fn91.htm#P9195_2530997" id="P9195_2530997" name="P9195_2530997">308</a></sup> inasmuch as she affords efficiency to Cogitatio.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XXXIV.-Other Varying Opinions Among the Valentinians Respecting the Deity, Characteristic Raillery.</font></p>
</ul><p>Others of purer mind, mindful of the honour of the Deity, have, for the purpose of freeing him from the discredit of even single wedlock, preferred assigning no sex whatever to Bythus; and therefore very likely they talk of "this deity" in the neuter gender rather than "this god." Others again, on the other hand, speak of him as both masculine and feminine, so that the worthy chronicler Fenestella must not suppose that an hermaphrodite; was only to be found among the good people of Luna.</p>

</ul><p>There are some who do not claim the first place for Bythus, but only a lower one. They put their Ogdoad in the foremost rank; itself, however, derived from a Tetrad, but under different names. For they put Proarche (<i>Before the Beginning</i>) first, Anennoetos (<i>Inconceivable</i>) second, Arrhetos (<i>Indescribable</i>) third, Aoratos (<i>Invisible</i>) fourth. Then after Proarche they say Arche (<i>Beginning</i>) came forth and occupied the first and the fifth place; from Anennoetos came Acataleptos (<i>Incomprehensible</i>) in the second and the sixth place; from Arrhetos came Anonomastos (<i>Nameless</i>) in the third and the seventh place; from Aoratos<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9202_2532457" id="P9202_2532457" name="P9202_2532457">309</a></sup> came Agennetos (<i>Unbegotten</i>) in the fourth and the eight place. Now by what method he arranges this, that each of these ¦ons should be born in two places, and that, too, at such intervals, I prefer to be ignorant of than to be informed. For what can be right in a system which is propounded with such absurd particulars?</p>

When, as they say, He thought of producing offspring, He on that account gained the name of Father. After producing, because the issue which He produced was true, He received the name of <i>Truth</i>. When He wanted Himself to be manifested, He on that account was announced as <i>Man</i>. Those, moreover, whom He preconceived in His thought when He produced them, were then designated <i>the Church</i>. As man, He uttered His <i>Word</i>; and so this <i>Word</i> is His first-begotten Son, and to the Word was added <i>Life</i>. And by this process the first Ogdoad was completed. However, the whole of this tiresome story is utterly poor and weak.</p>

They run thus: There comes, says he, before all things Proarche, the inconceivable, and indescribable, and nameless, which I for my own part call Monotes (<i>Solitude</i>). With this was associated another power, to which also I give the name of Henotes (<i>Unity</i>). Now, inasmuch as Monotes and Henotes-that is to say, Solitude and Union-were only one being, they produced, and yet not in the way of production,<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9215_2535069" id="P9215_2535069" name="P9215_2535069">316</a></sup> the intellectual, innascible, invisible beginning of all things, which human language<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9216_2535234" id="P9216_2535234" name="P9216_2535234">317</a></sup> has called Monad (<i>Solitude</i>).<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9217_2535277" id="P9217_2535277" name="P9217_2535277">318</a></sup> This has inherent in itself a consubstantial force, which it calls Unity<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9218_2535375" id="P9218_2535375" name="P9218_2535375">319</a></sup> These powers, accordingly, Solitude or Solitariness, <i>and</i> Unity, or Union, propagated all the other emanations of ¦ons.<sup><a href="footnote/fn92.htm#P9219_2535512" id="P9219_2535512" name="P9219_2535512">320</a></sup> Wonderful distinction, to be sure!
