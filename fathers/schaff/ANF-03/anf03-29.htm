<font size="3">Chapter I.-The Methods of Marcion's Argument Incorrect and Absurd. The Proper Course of the Argument.</font></p>
</ul><p>The Occasion of reproducing this little work, the fortunes of which we noticed in the preface of our first book, has furnished us with the opportunity of distinguishing, in our treatment of the subject of two Gods in opposition to Marcion, each of them with a description and section of his own, according to the division of the subject-matter, defining one of the gods to have no existence at all, and maintaining of the Other that He is rightly<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4277_1392712" id="P4277_1392712" name="P4277_1392712">2</a></sup> God; thus far keeping pace with the heretic of Pontus, who has been pleased to admit one unto, and exclude the other.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4278_1392840" id="P4278_1392840" name="P4278_1392840">3</a></sup> For he could not build up his mendacious scheme without pulling down the system of truth. He found it necessary to demolish<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4279_1393008" id="P4279_1393008" name="P4279_1393008">4</a></sup> some other thing, in order to build up the theory which he wished. This process, however, is like constructing a house without preparing suitable materials.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4280_1393178" id="P4280_1393178" name="P4280_1393178">5</a></sup> The discussion ought to have been directed to this point alone, that he is no god who supersedes the Creator. Then, when the false god had been excluded by certain rules which prescriptively settle what is the character of the One only perfect Divinity, there could have remained no longer any question as to the true God. The proof of His existence would have been clear, and that, too, amid the failure of all evidence in support of any other god; and still clearer<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4281_1393667" id="P4281_1393667" name="P4281_1393667">6</a></sup> would have seemed the point as to the honour in which He ought without controversy to be held: that He ought to be worshipped rather than judged; served reverentially rather than handled critically, or even dreaded for His severity. For what was more fully needed by man than a careful estimate of<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4282_1394081" id="P4282_1394081" name="P4282_1394081">7</a></sup> the true God, on whom, so to speak, he had alighted,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4283_1394146" id="P4283_1394146" name="P4283_1394146">8</a></sup> because there was no other god?</p>

</ul><p>We have now, then, cleared our way to the contemplation of the Almighty God, the Lord and Maker of the universe. His greatness, as I think, is shown in this, that from the beginning He made Himself known: He never hid Himself, but always shone out brightly, even before the time of Romulus, to say nothing of that of Tiberius; with the exception indeed that the heretics, and they alone, know Him not, although they take such pains about Him. They on this account suppose that another god must be assumed to exist, because they are more able to censure than deny Him whose existence is so evident, deriving all their thoughts about God from the deductions of sense; just as if some blind man, or a man of imperfect vision,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4287_1395122" id="P4287_1395122" name="P4287_1395122">9</a></sup> chose to assume some other sun of milder and healthier ray, because he sees not that which is the object of sight.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4288_1395262" id="P4288_1395262" name="P4288_1395262">10</a></sup> There is, O man, but one sun which rules<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4289_1395332" id="P4289_1395332" name="P4289_1395332">11</a></sup> this world and even when you think otherwise of him, he is best and useful; and although to you he may seem too fierce and baneful, or else, it may be, too sordid and corrupt, he yet is true to the laws of his own existence. Unable as you are to see through those laws, you would be equally impotent to bear the rays of any other sun, were there one, however great and good. Now, you whose sight is defective<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4290_1395756" id="P4290_1395756" name="P4290_1395756">12</a></sup> in respect of the inferior god, what is your view of the sublimer One? Really you are too lenient<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4291_1395869" id="P4291_1395869" name="P4291_1395869">13</a></sup> to your weakness; and set not yourself to the proof<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4292_1395946" id="P4292_1395946" name="P4292_1395946">14</a></sup> of things, holding God to be certainly, undoubtedly, and therefore sufficiently known, the very moment you have discovered Him to exist, though you know Him not except on the side where He has willed His proofs to lie. But you do not even deny God intelligently,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4293_1396239" id="P4293_1396239" name="P4293_1396239">15</a></sup> you treat of Him ignorantly;<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4294_1396284" id="P4294_1396284" name="P4294_1396284">16</a></sup> nay, you accuse Him with a semblance of intelligence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4295_1396356" id="P4295_1396356" name="P4295_1396356">17</a></sup> whom if you did but know Him, you would never accuse, nay, never treat of.<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4296_1396450" id="P4296_1396450" name="P4296_1396450">18</a></sup> You give Him His name indeed, but you deny the essential truth of that name, that is, the greatness which is called God; not acknowledging it to be such as, were it possible for it to have been known to man in every respect,<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4297_1396693" id="P4297_1396693" name="P4297_1396693">19</a></sup> would not be greatness. Isaiah even so early, with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of heretical hearts, asked, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? For who hath been His counsellor? With whom took He counsel? ... or who taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4298_1397018" id="P4298_1397018" name="P4298_1397018">20</a></sup> With whom the apostle agreeing exclaims, "Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!"<sup><a href="footnote/fn42.htm#P4299_1397241" id="P4299_1397241" name="P4299_1397241">21</a></sup> "His judgments unsearchable," as being those of God the Judge; and "His ways past finding out," as comprising an understanding and knowledge which no man has ever shown to Him, except it may be those critics of the Divine Being, who say, God ought not to have been this,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4300_1397530" id="P4300_1397530" name="P4300_1397530">22</a></sup> and He ought rather to have been that; as if any one knew what is in God, except the Spirit of God.<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4301_1397717" id="P4301_1397717" name="P4301_1397717">23</a></sup> Moreover, having the spirit of the world, and "in the wisdom of God by wisdom knowing not God,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4302_1397833" id="P4302_1397833" name="P4302_1397833">24</a></sup> they seem to themselves to be wiser<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4303_1397886" id="P4303_1397886" name="P4303_1397886">25</a></sup> than God; because, as the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, so also the wisdom of God is folly in the world's esteem. We, however, know that "the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4304_1398147" id="P4304_1398147" name="P4304_1398147">26</a></sup> Accordingly, God is then especially great, when He is small<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4305_1398226" id="P4305_1398226" name="P4305_1398226">27</a></sup> to man; then especially good, when not good in man's judgment; then especially unique, when He seems to man to be two or more. Now, if from the very first "the natural man, not receiving the things of the Spirit of God,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4306_1398462" id="P4306_1398462" name="P4306_1398462">28</a></sup> has deemed God's law to be foolishness, and has therefore neglected to observe it; and as a further consequence, by his not having faith, "even that which he seemeth to have hath been taken from him"<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4307_1398682" id="P4307_1398682" name="P4307_1398682">29</a></sup> -such as the grace of paradise and the friendship of God, by means of which he might have known all things of God, if he had continued in his obedience-what wonder is it, if he,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4308_1398902" id="P4308_1398902" name="P4308_1398902">30</a></sup> reduced to his material nature, and banished to the toil of tilling the ground, has in his very labour, downcast and earth-gravitating as it was, handed on that earth-derived spirit of the world to his entire race, wholly natural<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4309_1399177" id="P4309_1399177" name="P4309_1399177">31</a></sup> and heretical as it is, and not receiving the things which belong to God? Or who will hesitate to declare the great sin of Adam to have been heresy, when he committed it by the choice<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4310_1399386" id="P4310_1399386" name="P4310_1399386">32</a></sup> of his own will rather than of God's? Except that Adam never said to his fig-tree, Why hast thou made me thus? He confessed that he was led astray; and he did not conceal the seducer. He was a very rude heretic. He was disobedient; but yet he did not blaspheme his Creator, nor blame that Author of his being, Whom from the beginning of his life he had found to be so good and excellent, and Whom he had perhaps<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4311_1399911" id="P4311_1399911" name="P4311_1399911">33</a></sup> made his own judge from the very first.</p>

</ul><p>It will therefore be right for us, as we enter on the examination of the known God, when the question arises, in what condition He is known to us, to begin with His works, which are prior to man; so that His goodness, being discovered immediately along with Himself, and then constituted and prescriptively settled, may suggest to us some sense whereby we may understand how the subsequent order of things came about. The disciples of Marcion, moreover, may possibly be able, while recognising the goodness of our God, to learn how worthy it is likewise of the Divine Being, on those very grounds whereby we have proved it to be unworthy in the case of their god. Now this very point,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4315_1400859" id="P4315_1400859" name="P4315_1400859">34</a></sup> which is a material one in their scheme,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4316_1400937" id="P4316_1400937" name="P4316_1400937">35</a></sup> <i>Marcion</i> did not find in any other god, but eliminated it for himself out of his own god. The first goodness, then,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4317_1401091" id="P4317_1401091" name="P4317_1401091">36</a></sup> was that of the Creator, whereby God was unwilling to remain hidden for ever; in other words, (unwilling) that there should not be a something by which God should become known. For what, indeed, is so good as the knowledge and fruition<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4318_1401458" id="P4318_1401458" name="P4318_1401458">37</a></sup> of God? Now, although it did not transpires that this was good, because as yet there existed nothing to which it could transpire,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4319_1401632" id="P4319_1401632" name="P4319_1401632">38</a></sup> yet God foreknew what good would eventually transpire, and therefore He set Himself about developing<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4320_1401769" id="P4320_1401769" name="P4320_1401769">39</a></sup> His own perfect goodness, for the accomplishment of the good which was to transpire; not, indeed, a sudden goodness issuing in some accidental boon<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4321_1401935" id="P4321_1401935" name="P4321_1401935">40</a></sup> or in some excited impulse,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4322_1401991" id="P4322_1401991" name="P4322_1401991">41</a></sup> such as must be dated simply from the moment when it began to operate. For if it did itself produce its own beginning when it began to operate, it had not, in fact, a beginning itself when it acted. When, however, an initial act had been once done by it, the scheme of temporal seasons began, for distinguishing and noting which, the stars and luminaries of heaven were arranged in their order. "Let them be," says God, "for seasons, and for days, and years."<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4323_1402483" id="P4323_1402483" name="P4323_1402483">42</a></sup> Previous, then, to this temporal course, (the goodness) which created time had not time; nor before that beginning which the same goodness originated, had it a beginning. Being therefore without aIl order of a beginning, and all mode of time, it will be reckoned to possess an age, measureless in extent<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4324_1402804" id="P4324_1402804" name="P4324_1402804">43</a></sup> and endless in duration;<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4325_1402843" id="P4325_1402843" name="P4325_1402843">44</a></sup> nor will it be possible to regard it as a sudden or adventitious or impulsive emotion, because it has nothing to occasion such an estimate of itself; in other words, no sort of temporal sequence. It must therefore be accounted an eternal attribute, inbred in God,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4326_1403127" id="P4326_1403127" name="P4326_1403127">45</a></sup> and everlasting,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4327_1403194" id="P4327_1403194" name="P4327_1403194">46</a></sup> and on this account worthy of the Divine Being, putting to shame for ever<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4328_1403313" id="P4328_1403313" name="P4328_1403313">47</a></sup> the benevolence of Marcion's god, subsequent as he is to (I will not say) all beginnings and times, but to the very malignity of the Creator, if indeed malignity could possibly have been found in goodness.</p>

That image was wrought out by a goodness even more operative than its wont,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4341_1407328" id="P4341_1407328" name="P4341_1407328">57</a></sup> with no imperious word, but with friendly hand preceded by an almost affable<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4342_1407440" id="P4342_1407440" name="P4342_1407440">58</a></sup> utterance: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4343_1407520" id="P4343_1407520" name="P4343_1407520">59</a></sup> Goodness spake the word; Goodness formed man of the dust of the ground into so great a substance of the flesh, built up out of one material with so many qualities; Goodness breathed into him a soul, not dead but living.

For, said He, that the man be alone is not good.<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4348_1408560" id="P4348_1408560" name="P4348_1408560">64</a></sup> He knew full well what a blessing to him would be the sex of Mary,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4349_1408649" id="P4349_1408649" name="P4349_1408649">65</a></sup> and also of the Church. The law, however, which you find fault with,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4350_1408892" id="P4350_1408892" name="P4350_1408892">66</a></sup> and wrest into a subject of contention, was imposed on man by Goodness, aiming at his happiness, that he might cleave to God, and so not show himself an abject creature rather than a free one, nor reduce himself to the level of the other animals, his subjects, which were free from God, and exempt from all tedious subjection;<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4351_1409232" id="P4351_1409232" name="P4351_1409232">67</a></sup> but might, as the sole human being, boast that he alone was worthy of receiving laws from God; and as a rational being, capable of intelligence and knowledge, be restrained within the bounds of rational liberty, subject to Him who had subjected all things unto him. To secure the observance of this law, Goodness likewise took counsel by help of this sanction: "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shall surely die."<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4352_1409681" id="P4352_1409681" name="P4352_1409681">68</a></sup> For it was a most benignant act of His thus to point out the issues of transgression, lest ignorance of the danger should encourage a neglect of obedience. Now, since<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4353_1409866" id="P4353_1409866" name="P4353_1409866">69</a></sup> it was given as a reason previous to the imposition of the law, it also amounted to a motive for subsequently observing it, that a penalty was annexed to its transgression; a penalty, indeed, which He who proposed it was still unwilling that it should be incurred. Learn then the goodness of our God amidst these things and up to this point; learn it from His excellent works, from His kindly blessings, from His indulgent bounties, from His gracious providences, from His laws and warnings, so good and merciful.</p>

</ul><p>Now then, ye dogs, whom the apostle puts outside,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4357_1410673" id="P4357_1410673" name="P4357_1410673">70</a></sup> and who yelp at the God of truth, let us come to your various questions. These are the bones of contention, which you are perpetually gnawing! If God is good, and prescient of the future, and able to avert evil, why did He permit man, the very image and likeness of Himself, and, by the origin of his soul, His own substance too, to be deceived by the devil, and fall from obedience of the law into death? For if He had been good, and so unwilling that such a catastrophe should happen, and prescient, so as not to be ignorant of what was to come to pass, and powerful enough to hinder its occurrence, that issue would never have come about, which should be impossible under these three conditions of the divine greatness. Since, however, it has occurred, the contrary proposition is most certainly true, that God must be deemed neither good, nor prescient, nor powerful. For <i>as</i> no such issue could have happened had God been such as He is reputed-good, and prescient, and mighty-<i>so</i> has this issue actually happened, because He is not such a God. In reply, we must first vindicate those attributes in the Creator which are called in question-namely, His goodness and foreknowledge, and power. But I shall not linger long over this point<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4358_1411931" id="P4358_1411931" name="P4358_1411931">71</a></sup> for Christ's own definition<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4359_1411974" id="P4359_1411974" name="P4359_1411974">72</a></sup> comes to our aid at once. From works must proofs be obtained. The Creator's works testify at once to His goodness, since they are good, as we have shown, and to His power, since they are mighty, and spring indeed out of nothing. And even if they were made out of some (previous) matter, as some<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4360_1412286" id="P4360_1412286" name="P4360_1412286">73</a></sup> will have it, they are even thus out of nothing, because they <i>were</i> not what they <i>are</i>. In short, both they are great because they are good; and<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4361_1412488" id="P4361_1412488" name="P4361_1412488">74</a></sup> God is likewise mighty, because all things are His own, whence He is almighty. But what shall I say of His prescience, which has for its witnesses as many prophets as it inspired? After all,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4362_1412699" id="P4362_1412699" name="P4362_1412699">75</a></sup> what title to prescience do we look for in the Author of the universe, since it was by this very attribute that He foreknew all things when He appointed them their places, and appointed them their places when He fore knew them? There is sin itself. If He had not foreknown this, He would not have proclaimed a caution against it under the penalty of death. Now if there were in God such attributes as must have rendered it both impossible and improper for any evil to have happened to man,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4363_1413204" id="P4363_1413204" name="P4363_1413204">76</a></sup> and yet evil did occur, let us consider man's condition also-whether <i>it</i> were not, in fact, rather the cause why that came to pass which could not have happened through God. I find, then, that man was by God constituted free, master of his own will and power; indicating the presence of God's image and likeness in him by nothing so well as by this constitution of his nature. For it was not by his face, and by the lineaments of his body, though they were so varied in his human nature, that he expressed his likeness to the form of God; but he showed his stamp<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4364_1413799" id="P4364_1413799" name="P4364_1413799">77</a></sup> in that essence which he derived from God Himself (that is, the spiritual,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4365_1413893" id="P4365_1413893" name="P4365_1413893">78</a></sup> which answered to the form of God), and in the freedom and power of his will. This his state was confirmed even by the very law which God then imposed upon him. For a law would not be imposed upon one who had it not in his power to render that obedience which is due to law; nor again, would the penalty of death be threatened against sin, if a contempt of the law were impossible to man in the liberty of his will. So in the Creator's subsequent laws also you will find, when He sets before man good and evil, life and death, that the entire course of discipline is arranged in precepts by God's calling men from sin, and threatening and exhorting them; and this on no other ground than<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4366_1414594" id="P4366_1414594" name="P4366_1414594">79</a></sup> that man is free, with a will either for obedience or resistance.</p>

</ul><p>But although we shall be understood, from our argument, to be only so affirming man's unshackled power over his will, that what happens to him should be laid to his own charge, and not to God's, yet that you may not object, even now, that he ought not to have been so constituted, since his liberty and power of will might turn out to be injurious, I will first of all maintain that he was rightly so constituted, that I may with the greater confidence commend both his actual constitution, and the additional fact of its being worthy of the Divine Being; the cause which led to man's being created with such a constitution being shown to be the better one. Moreover, man thus constituted will be protected by both the goodness of God and by His purpose,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4370_1415665" id="P4370_1415665" name="P4370_1415665">80</a></sup> both of which are always found in concert in our God.

Proper also was it that there should be something worthy of knowing God. What could be found so worthy as the image and likeness of God? This also was undoubtedly good and reasonable. Therefore it was proper that (he who is) the image and likeness of God should be formed with a free will and a mastery of himself;<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4375_1416599" id="P4375_1416599" name="P4375_1416599">85</a></sup> so that this very thing-namely, freedom of will and self-command-might be reckoned as the image and likeness of God in him. For this purpose such an essence<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4376_1416778" id="P4376_1416778" name="P4376_1416778">86</a></sup> was adapted<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4377_1416807" id="P4377_1416807" name="P4377_1416807">87</a></sup> to man as suited this character,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4378_1416857" id="P4378_1416857" name="P4378_1416857">88</a></sup> even the afflatus of the Deity, Himself free and uncontrolled.<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4379_1416933" id="P4379_1416933" name="P4379_1416933">89</a></sup> But if you will take some other view of the case,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4380_1417005" id="P4380_1417005" name="P4380_1417005">90</a></sup> how came it to pass<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4381_1417044" id="P4381_1417044" name="P4381_1417044">91</a></sup> that man, when in possession of the whole world, did not above all things reign in self-possession<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4382_1417160" id="P4382_1417160" name="P4382_1417160">92</a></sup> -a master over others, a slave to himself? The goodness of God, then, you can learn from His gracious gift<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4383_1417295" id="P4383_1417295" name="P4383_1417295">93</a></sup> to man, and His purpose from His disposal of all things.<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4384_1417369" id="P4384_1417369" name="P4384_1417369">94</a></sup> At present, let God's <i>goodness</i> alone occupy our attention, that which gave so large a gift to man, even the liberty of his will. God's <i>purpose</i> claims some other opportunity of treatment, offering as it does instruction of like import. Now, God alone is good by nature. For He, who has that which is without beginning, has it not by creation,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4385_1417778" id="P4385_1417778" name="P4385_1417778">95</a></sup> but by nature. Man, however, who exists entirely by creation, having a beginning, along with that beginning obtained the form in which he exists; and thus he is not by nature disposed to good, but by creation, not having it as his own attribute to be good, because, (as we have said, ) it is not by nature, but by creation, that he is disposed to good, according to the appointment of his good Creator, even the Author of all good. In order, therefore, that man might have a goodness of his own,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4386_1418293" id="P4386_1418293" name="P4386_1418293">96</a></sup> bestowed<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4387_1418338" id="P4387_1418338" name="P4387_1418338">97</a></sup> on him by God, and there might be henceforth in man a property, and in a certain sense a natural attribute of goodness, there was assigned to him in the constitution of his nature, as a formal witness<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4388_1418557" id="P4388_1418557" name="P4388_1418557">98</a></sup> of the goodness which God bestowed upon him, freedom and power of the will, such as should cause good to be performed spontaneously by man, as a property of his own, on the ground that no less than this<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4389_1418934" id="P4389_1418934" name="P4389_1418934">99</a></sup> would be required in the matter of a goodness which was to be voluntarily exercised by him, that is to say, by the liberty of his will, without either favour or servility to the constitution of his nature, so that man should be good<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4390_1419204" id="P4390_1419204" name="P4390_1419204">100</a></sup> just up to this point,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4391_1419253" id="P4391_1419253" name="P4391_1419253">101</a></sup> if he should display his goodness in accordance with his natural constitution indeed, but still as the result of his will, as a property of his nature; and, by a similar exercise of volition,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4392_1419463" id="P4392_1419463" name="P4392_1419463">102</a></sup> should show himself to be too strong<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4393_1419516" id="P4393_1419516" name="P4393_1419516">103</a></sup> in defence against evil also (for even this God, of course, foresaw), being free, and master of himself; because, if he were wanting in this prerogative <i>of self-mastery</i>, so as to perform even good by necessity and not will, he would, in the helplessness of his servitude, become subject to the usurpation of evil, a slave as much to evil as to good. Entire freedom of will, therefore, was conferred upon him in both tendencies; so that, as master of himself, he might constantly encounter good by spontaneous observance of it, and evil by its spontaneous avoidance; because, were man even otherwise circumstanced, it was yet his bounden duty, in the judgment of God, to do justice according to the motions<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4394_1420238" id="P4394_1420238" name="P4394_1420238">104</a></sup> of his will regarded, of course, as free. But the reward neither of good nor of evil could be paid to the man who should be found to have been either good or evil through necessity and not choice. In this really lay<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4395_1420470" id="P4395_1420470" name="P4395_1420470">105</a></sup> the law which did not exclude, but rather prove, <i>human</i> liberty by a spontaneous rendering of obedience, or a spontaneous commission of iniquity; so patent was the liberty of man's will for either issue. Since, therefore, both the goodness and purpose of God are<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4396_1420755" id="P4396_1420755" name="P4396_1420755">106</a></sup> discovered in the gift to man of freedom in his will, it is not right, after ignoring the original definition of goodness and purpose which it was necessary to determine previous to any discussion of the subject, on subsequent facts to presume to say that God ought not in such a way to have formed man, because the issue was other than what was assumed to be<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4397_1421212" id="P4397_1421212" name="P4397_1421212">107</a></sup> proper for God.

It is, no doubt, an easy process for persons who take offence at the fall of man, before they have looked into the facts of his creation, to impute the blame of what happened to the Creator, without any examination of His purpose. To conclude: the goodness of God, then fully considered from the beginning of His works, will be enough to convince us that nothing evil could possibly have come forth from God; and the liberty of man will, after a second thought,<sup><a href="footnote/fn43.htm#P4399_1421927" id="P4399_1421927" name="P4399_1421927">109</a></sup> show us that it alone is chargeable with the fault which itself committed.</p>

For, while holding this earnestness and truth of the good God, which are indeed<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4405_1422784" id="P4405_1422784" name="P4405_1422784">112</a></sup> capable of proof from the rational creation, you will not wonder at the fact that God did not interfere to prevent the occurrence of what He wished not to happen, in order that He might keep from harm what He wished. For, since He had once for all allowed (and, as we have shown, worthily allowed) to man freedom of will and mastery of himself, surely He from His very authority in creation permitted <i>these gifts</i> to be enjoyed: to be enjoyed, too, so far as lay in Himself, according to His own character as God, that is, for good (for who would permit anything hostile to himself? ); and, so far as lay in man, according to the impulses of his liberty (for who does not, when giving anything to any one to enjoy, accompany the gift with a permission to enjoy it with all his heart and will? ). The necessary consequence,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4406_1423664" id="P4406_1423664" name="P4406_1423664">113</a></sup> therefore, was, that God must separate from the liberty which He had once for all bestowed upon man (in other words, keep within Himself), both His foreknowledge and power, through which He might have prevented man's falling into danger when attempting wrongly to enjoy his liberty. Now, if He had interposed, He would have rescinded the liberty of man's will, which He had permitted with set purpose, and in goodness. But, suppose God had interposed; suppose Him to have abrogated man's liberty, by warning him from the tree, and keeping off the subtle serpent from his interview with the woman; would not Marcion then exclaim, What a frivolous, unstable, and faithless Lord, cancelling the gifts He had bestowed! Why did He allow any liberty of will, if He afterwards withdrew it? Why withdraw it after allowing it? Let Him choose where to brand Himself with error, either in His original constitution of man, or in His subsequent abrogation thereof! If He had checked (man's freedom), would He not then seem to have been rather deceived, through want of foresight into the future? But in giving it full scope, who would not say that He did so in ignorance of the issue of things? God, however, did fore-know that man would make a bad use of his created constitution; and yet what can be so worthy of God as His earnestness of purpose, and the truth of His created works, be they what they may? Man must see, if he failed to make the most of<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4407_1425256" id="P4407_1425256" name="P4407_1425256">114</a></sup> the good gift he had received, how that he was himself guilty in respect of the law which he did not choose to keep, and not that the Lawgiver was committing a fraud against His own law, by not permitting its injunctions to be fulfilled. Whenever you are inclined to indulge in such censure<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4408_1425580" id="P4408_1425580" name="P4408_1425580">115</a></sup> (and it is the most becoming for you) against the Creator, recall gently to your mind in His behalf<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4409_1425700" id="P4409_1425700" name="P4409_1425700">116</a></sup> His earnestness, and endurance, and truth, in having given completeness<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4410_1425808" id="P4410_1425808" name="P4410_1425808">117</a></sup> to His creatures both as rational and good.</p>

Accordingly, God gave him <i>to live</i> when he was formed into a living soul; but He charged him <i>to live virtuously</i> when he was required to obey a law. So also God shows that man was not constituted for death, by now wishing that he should be restored to life, preferring the sinner's repentance to his death.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4415_1426540" id="P4415_1426540" name="P4415_1426540">119</a></sup> As, therefore, God designed for man a condition of life, so man brought on himself a state of death; and this, too, neither through infirmity nor through ignorance, so that no blame can be imputed to the Creator. No doubt it was an angel who was the seducer; but then the victim of that seduction was free, and master of himself; and as being the image and likeness of God, was stronger than any angel; and as being, too, the <i>afflatus</i> of the Divine Being, was nobler than that material spirit of which angels were made. <i>Who maketh</i>, says he, <i>His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire</i>.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4416_1427161" id="P4416_1427161" name="P4416_1427161">120</a></sup> He would not have made all things subject to man, if he had been too weak for the dominion, and inferior to the angels, to whom He assigned no such subjects; nor would He have put the burden of law upon him, if he had been incapable of sustaining so great a weight; nor, again, would He have threatened with the penalty of death a creature whom He knew to be guiltless on the score of his helplessness: in short, if He had made him infirm, it would not have been by liberty and independence of will, but rather by the withholding from him these endowments. And thus it comes to pass, that even now also, the same human being, the same substance of his soul, the same condition as Adam's, is made conqueror over the same devil by the self-same liberty and power of his will, when it moves in obedience to the laws of God.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4417_1428001" id="P4417_1428001" name="P4417_1428001">121</a></sup> </p>

</ul><p>But, you say, in what way soever the substance of the Creator is found to be susceptible of fault, when the <i>afflatus</i> of God, that is to say, the soul,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4421_1428471" id="P4421_1428471" name="P4421_1428471">122</a></sup> offends in man, it cannot but be that that fault of the portion is refferible to the original whole. Now, to meet this objection, we must explain the nature<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4422_1428760" id="P4422_1428760" name="P4422_1428760">123</a></sup> of the soul. We must at the outset hold fast the meaning of the Greek scripture, which has <i>afflatus</i>, not spirit.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4423_1428890" id="P4423_1428890" name="P4423_1428890">124</a></sup> Some interpreters of the Greek, without reflecting on the difference of the words, and careless about their exact meaning, put spirit for <i>afflatus</i>; they thus afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4424_1429349" id="P4424_1429349" name="P4424_1429349">125</a></sup> the Spirit of God, that is to say, God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. <i>Afflatus</i>, observe then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is the spirit's gentle breeze,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4425_1429568" id="P4425_1429568" name="P4425_1429568">126</a></sup> but it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and although it proceeds from wind, yet a breeze is not the wind. One may call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same manner, man is the image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. <i>Afflatus</i> is therefore the image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case equal to the very thing.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4426_1429949" id="P4426_1429949" name="P4426_1429949">127</a></sup> It is one thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality itself. So, although the <i>afflatus</i> is the image of the spirit, it is yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way, that, because the reality-that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine Being-is faultless, therefore the <i>afflatus</i> also, that is to say, the image, ought not by any possibility to have done wrong. In this respect will the image be less than the reality, and the <i>afflatus</i> inferior to the spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments of divinity, such as an immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over itself, foreknowledge in a great degree,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4427_1430644" id="P4427_1430644" name="P4427_1430644">128</a></sup> reasonableness, capacity of understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an image still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute exemption from fault,-a property which is only conceded to God, that is, to the reality, and which is simply incompatible with an image. An image, although it may express all the lineaments of the reality, is yet wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like manner, the soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the simple power thereof, that is to say, its happy exemption from sinning.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4428_1431248" id="P4428_1431248" name="P4428_1431248">129</a></sup> Were it otherwise,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4429_1431302" id="P4429_1431302" name="P4429_1431302">130</a></sup> it would not be soul, but spirit; not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to take another view of the matter,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4430_1431436" id="P4430_1431436" name="P4430_1431436">131</a></sup> not everything which pertains to God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain that His <i>afflatus</i> was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath of God. And in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you would not thereby make the flute human, although it was your own human breath which you breathed into it, precisely as God breathed of His own Spirit, In fact,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4431_1431861" id="P4431_1431861" name="P4431_1431861">132</a></sup> the Scripture, by expressly saying<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4432_1431912" id="P4432_1431912" name="P4432_1431912">133</a></sup> that God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul, not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that <i>soul</i> from the condition of the Creator. The work must necessarily be distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him. The pitcher will not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will the <i>afflatus</i>, because made by the spirit, be on that account the spirit. The soul has often been called by the same name as the breath. You should also take care that no descent be made from the breath to a still lower quality. So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the soul, which you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an equality with God, that is, a freedom from fault, I contend that it is infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with an angel, I am compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of the two, to whom the angels are ministers,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4433_1432895" id="P4433_1432895" name="P4433_1432895">134</a></sup> who is destined to be the judge of angels,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4434_1432957" id="P4434_1432957" name="P4434_1432957">135</a></sup> if he shall stand fast in the law of God-an obedience which he refused at first.

The <i>possibility</i> lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the breath and not the spirit; the <i>impropriety</i>, however, arose from its power of will, as being free, and not a slave. It was furthermore assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of incurring death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature, and a direction for its liberty of choice. So that the soul can no longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity with God, that is to say, through the <i>afflatus</i>, but rather through that which was an addition to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed given to it by God in accordance with His purpose and reason, but recklessly employed<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4436_1433944" id="P4436_1433944" name="P4436_1433944">137</a></sup> by man according as he chose.

For the liberty of the will will not retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed, but on him by whom it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want to impute to the Creator? If it is man's sin, it will not be God's fault, because it is man's doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the sin, who turns out to be its forbidder, nay, its condemner. If death is the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its own author to Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt he introduced it, which assuredly<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4438_1434685" id="P4438_1434685" name="P4438_1434685">139</a></sup> would not have appeared had man not despised it.</p>

"Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle; and with gold hast thou filled thy barns and thy treasuries. From the day when thou wast created, when I set thee, a cherub, upon the holy mountain of God, thou wast in the midst of stones of fire, thou wast irreproachable in thy days, from the day of thy creation, until thine iniquities were discovered.

And yet you are forced to declare injustice to be one of the worst of things, and by the same rule are constrained to class justice amongst the most excellent. Since there is nothing hostile<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4465_1442606" id="P4465_1442606" name="P4465_1442606">160</a></sup> to evil which is not good, and no enemy of good which is not evil. It follows, then, that as injustice is an evil, so in the same degree is justice a good. Nor should it be regarded as simply a species of goodness, but as the practical observance<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4466_1442869" id="P4466_1442869" name="P4466_1442869">161</a></sup> of it, because goodness (unless justice be so controlled as to be just) will not be goodness, if it be unjust. For nothing is good which is unjust; while everything, on the other hand, which is just is good.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XII.-The Attributes of Goodness and Justice Should Not Be Separated. They are Compatible in the True God. The Function of Justice in the Divine Being Described.</font></p>
</ul><p>Since, therefore, there is this union and agreement between goodness and justice, you cannot prescribe<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4470_1443362" id="P4470_1443362" name="P4470_1443362">162</a></sup> their separation. With what face will you determine the separation of your two Gods, regarding in their separate condition one as distinctively the good God, and the other as distinctively the just God? Where the just is, there also exists the good. in short, from the very first the Creator was both good and also just. And both His attributes advanced together. His goodness created, His justice arranged, the world; and in this process it even then decreed that the world should be formed of good materials, because it took counsel with goodness. The work of justice is apparent, in the separation which was pronounced between light and darkness, between day and night, between heaven and earth, between the water above and the water beneath, between the gathering together of the sea and the mass of the dry land, between the greater lights and the lesser, between the luminaries of the day and those of the night, between male and female, between the tree of knowledge of death and of life, between the world and paradise, between the aqueous and the earth-born animals. As goodness conceived all things, so did justice discriminate them. With the determination of the latter, everything was arranged and set in order. Every site and quality<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4471_1444718" id="P4471_1444718" name="P4471_1444718">163</a></sup> of the elements, their effect, motion, and state, the rise and setting of each, are the judicial determinations of the Creator. Do not suppose that His function as a judge must be defined as beginning I when evil began, and so tarnish His justice i with the cause of evil. By such considerations, then, do we show that this attribute advanced in company with goodness, the author<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4472_1445114" id="P4472_1445114" name="P4472_1445114">164</a></sup> of all things,-worthy of being herself, too, deemed innate and natural, and not as accidentally accruing<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4473_1445236" id="P4473_1445236" name="P4473_1445236">165</a></sup> to God, inasmuch as she was found to be in Him, her Lord, the arbiter of His works.</p>

</ul><p>But yet, when evil afterwards broke out, and the goodness of God began now to have an adversary to contend against, God's justice also acquired another function, even that of directing His goodness according to men's application for it.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4477_1445742" id="P4477_1445742" name="P4477_1445742">166</a></sup> And this is the result: the divine goodness, being interrupted in that free course whereby God was spontaneously good, is now dispensed according to the deserts of every man; it is offered to the worthy, denied to the unworthy, taken away from the unthankful, and also avenged on all its enemies. Thus the entire office of justice in this respect becomes an agency<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4478_1446136" id="P4478_1446136" name="P4478_1446136">167</a></sup> for goodness: whatever it condemns by its judgment, whatever it chastises by its condemnation, whatever (to use your phrase) it ruthlessly pursues,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4479_1446303" id="P4479_1446303" name="P4479_1446303">168</a></sup> it, in fact, benefits with good instead of injuring. Indeed, the fear of judgment contributes to good, not to evil. For good, now contending with an enemy, was not strong enough to recommend itself<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4480_1446516" id="P4480_1446516" name="P4480_1446516">169</a></sup> by itself alone. At all events, if it could do <i>so much</i>, it could not keep its ground; for it had lost its impregnability through the foe, unless some power of fear supervened, such as might compel the very unwilling to seek after good, and take care of it. But who, when so many incentives to evil were assailing him, would desire that good, which he could despise with impunity? Who, again, would take care of what he could lose without danger? You read bow broad is the road to evil,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4481_1447021" id="P4481_1447021" name="P4481_1447021">170</a></sup> how thronged in comparison with the opposite: would not all glide down that road were there nothing in it to fear? We dread the Creator's tremendous threats, and yet scarcely turn away from evil. What, if He threatened not? Will you call this justice an evil, when it is all unfavourable to evil? Will you deny it to be a good, when it has its eye towards<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4482_1447400" id="P4482_1447400" name="P4482_1447400">171</a></sup> good? What sort of being ought you to wish God to be? Would it be right to prefer that He should be such, that sins might flourish under Him, and the devil make mock at Him? Would you suppose Him to be a good God, who should be able to make a man worse by security in sin? Who is the author of good, but He who also requires it? In like manner who is a stranger to evil, except Him who is its enemy? Who its enemy, besides Him who is its conqueror? Who else its conqueror, than He who is its punisher? Thus God is wholly good, because in all things He is on the side of good. In fact, He is omnipotent, because able both to help and to hurt. Merely to profit is a comparatively small matter, because it can do nothing else than a good turn. From such a conduct<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4483_1448179" id="P4483_1448179" name="P4483_1448179">172</a></sup> with what confidence can I hope for good, if this is its only ability? How can I follow after the reward of innocence, if I have no regard to the requital of wrong-doing? I must needs have my doubts whether he might not fail in recompensing one or other alternative, who was unequal in his resources to meet both. Thus far, then, justice is the very fulness of the Deity Himself, manifesting God as both a perfect father and a perfect master: a father in His mercy, a master in His discipline; a father in the mildness of His power, a master in its severity; a father who must be loved with dutiful affection, a master who must needs be feared; be loved, because He prefers mercy to sacrifice;<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4484_1448893" id="P4484_1448893" name="P4484_1448893">173</a></sup> be feared because He dislikes sin; be loved, because He prefers the sinner, s repentance to his death;<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4485_1449015" id="P4485_1449015" name="P4485_1449015">174</a></sup> be feared, because He dislikes the sinners who do not repent. Accordingly, the divine law enjoins duties in respect of both these attributes: <i>Thou shalt love God</i>, and, <i>Thou shalt fear God</i>. It proposed one for the obedient man, the other for the transgressor.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4486_1449299" id="P4486_1449299" name="P4486_1449299">175</a></sup> </p>

Behold, they say, how He acknowledges Himself to be the creator of evil in the passage, "It is I who create evil." They take a word whose one form reduces to confusion and ambiguity two kinds of evils (because both sins and punishments are called <i>evils</i>), and will have Him in every passage to be understood as the creator of all evil things, in order that He may be designated the author of evil. We, on the contrary, distinguish between the two meanings of the word in question, and, by separating evils of sin from penal evils, <i>mala culpµ</i> from <i>mala p£nµ</i>, confine to each of the two classes its own author,-the devil as the author of the sinful evils (<i>culpµ</i>), and God as the creator of penal evils (<i>p£nµ</i>); so that the one class shall be accounted as morally bad, and the other be classed as the operations of justice passing penal sentences against the evils of sin. Of the latter class of evils which are compatible with justice, God is therefore avowedly the creator. They are, no doubt, evil to those by whom they are endured, but still on their own account good, as being just and defensive of good and hostile to sin. In this respect they are, moreover, worthy of God. Else prove them to be unjust, in order to show them deserving of a place in the sinful class, that is to say, evils of injustice; because if they turn out to belong to justice, they will be no longer evil things, but good-evil only to the bad, by whom even directly good things are condemned as evil. In this case, you must decide that man, although the wilful contemner of the divine law, unjustly bore the doom which he would like to have escaped; that the wickedness of those days was unjustly smitten by the deluge, afterwards by the fire (of Sodom); that Egypt, although most depraved and superstitious, and, worse still, the harasser of its guest-population,<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4492_1451650" id="P4492_1451650" name="P4492_1451650">178</a></sup> was unjustly stricken with the chastisement of its ten plagues. <i>God</i> hardens the heart of Pharaoh.

Even His own people did God visit in their ingratitude.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4494_1452447" id="P4494_1452447" name="P4494_1452447">180</a></sup> Against young lads, too, did He send forth bears, for their irreverence to the prophet.<sup><a href="footnote/fn44.htm#P4495_1452561" id="P4495_1452561" name="P4495_1452561">181</a></sup> </p>

Now, that we may not linger too long on the point, (I would challenge you to) assert the other reasons also, that you may condemn <i>the Judge's</i> sentences; extenuate the delinquencies of the sinner, that you may blame his judicial conviction.

As was the grace, so was the offence; so that the grace and the offence equally ran down through the whole race, with the reservation, indeed, of that subsequent ordinance by which it became possible to refrain from saying, that "the fathers had eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth were set on edge: "<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4504_1454190" id="P4504_1454190" name="P4504_1454190">187</a></sup> in other words, that the father should not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son the iniquity of the father, but that every man should be chargeable with his own sin; so that the harshness of the law having been reduced<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4505_1454436" id="P4505_1454436" name="P4505_1454436">188</a></sup> after the hardness of the people, justice was no longer to judge <i>the race</i>, but individuals.

We who believe that God really lived on earth, and took upon Him the low estate of human form,<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4517_1456679" id="P4517_1456679" name="P4517_1456679">197</a></sup> for the purpose of man's salvation, are very far from thinking as those do who refuse to believe that God cares for<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4518_1456811" id="P4518_1456811" name="P4518_1456811">198</a></sup> anything. Whence has found its way to the heretics an argument of this kind: If God is angry, and jealous, and roused, and grieved, He must therefore be corrupted, and must therefore die. Fortunately, however, it is a part of the creed of Christians even to believe that God did die,<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4519_1457110" id="P4519_1457110" name="P4519_1457110">199</a></sup> and yet that He is alive for evermore. Superlative is their folly, who prejudge divine things from human; so that, because in man's corrupt condition there are found passions of this description, therefore there must be deemed to exist in God also sensations<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4520_1457466" id="P4520_1457466" name="P4520_1457466">200</a></sup> of the same kind. Discriminate between the natures, and assign to them their respective senses, which are as diverse as their natures require, although they seem to have a community of designations. We read, indeed, of God's right hand, and eyes, and feet: these must not, however, be compared with those of human beings, because they are associated in one and the same name. Now, as great as shall be the difference between the divine and the human body, although their members pass under identical names, so great will also be the diversity between the divine and the human soul, notwithstanding that their sensations are designated by the same names. These sensations in the human being are rendered just as corrupt by the corruptibility of man's substance, as in God they are rendered incorruptible by the incorruption of the divine essence. Do you really believe the Creator to be God? By all means, is your reply. How then do you suppose that in God there is anything human, and not that all is divine? Him whom you do not deny to be God, you confess to be not human; because, when you confess Him to be God, you have, in fact, already determined that He is undoubtedly diverse from every sort of human conditions. Furthermore, although you allow, with others,<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4521_1458748" id="P4521_1458748" name="P4521_1458748">201</a></sup> that man was inbreathed by God into a living soul, not God by man, it is yet palpably absurd of you to be placing human characteristics in God rather than divine ones in man, and clothing God in the likeness of man, instead of man in the image of God. And this, therefore, is to be deemed the likeness of God in man, that the human soul have the same emotions and sensations as God, although they are not of the same kind; differing as they do both in their conditions and their issues according to their nature. Then, again, with respect to the opposite sensations,-I mean meekness, patience, mercy, and the very parent of them all, goodness,-why do you form your opinion of<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4522_1459440" id="P4522_1459440" name="P4522_1459440">202</a></sup> the divine displays of these (from the human qualities)? For we indeed do not possess them in perfection, because it is God alone who is perfect. So also in regard to those others,-namely, anger and irritation. we are not affected by them in so happy a manner, because God alone is truly happy, by reason of His property of incorruptibility. Angry He will possibly be, but not irritated, nor dangerously tempted;<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4523_1459907" id="P4523_1459907" name="P4523_1459907">203</a></sup> He will be moved, but not subverted.<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4524_1459967" id="P4524_1459967" name="P4524_1459967">204</a></sup> All appliances He must needs use, because of all contingencies; as many sensations as there are causes: anger because of the wicked, and indignation because of the ungrateful, and jealousy because of the proud, and whatsoever else is a hinderance to the evil. So, again, mercy on account of the erring, and patience on account of the impenitent, and pre-eminent resources<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4525_1460357" id="P4525_1460357" name="P4525_1460357">205</a></sup> on account of the meritorious, and whatsoever is necessary to the good.

At any rate, my Creator did not learn from your God to issue such commandments as: Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not steal; thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not covet what is thy neighbour's; honour thy father and thy mother; and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. To these prime counsels of innocence, chastity, and justice, and piety, are also added prescriptions of humanity, as when every seventh year slaves are released for liberty;<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4541_1463912" id="P4541_1463912" name="P4541_1463912">218</a></sup> when at the same period the land is spared from tillage; a place is also granted to the needy; and from the treading ox's mouth the muzzle is removed, for the enjoyment of the fruit of his labour before him, in order that kindness first shown in the case of animals might be raised from such rudiments<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4542_1464239" id="P4542_1464239" name="P4542_1464239">219</a></sup> to the refreshment<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4543_1464277" id="P4543_1464277" name="P4543_1464277">220</a></sup> of men.</p>

By the same law another result is also obtained,<sup><a href="footnote/fn45.htm#P4551_1465676" id="P4551_1465676" name="P4551_1465676">225</a></sup> even the more ready kindling of the fear of retaliation by reason of the very savour of passion which is in it. There is no more bitter thing, than to endure the very suffering which you have inflicted upon others.

Of course the Creator deserved all the greater blame, because it was from His own people that He took away food, rather than from the more ungrateful Marcionites.

You do not, however, consider the law of the Sabbath: they are human works, not divine, which it prohibits.<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4603_1478583" id="P4603_1478583" name="P4603_1478583">268</a></sup> For it says, "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work."

The conclusion is, that from the Sabbath-day He removes those works which He had before enjoined for the six days, that is, your own works; in other words, human works of daily life. Now, the carrying around of the ark is evidently not an ordinary daily duty, nor yet a human one; but a rare and a sacred work, and, as being then ordered by the direct precept of God, a divine one.

Thus, in the present instance, there is a clear distinction respecting the Sabbath's prohibition of human labours, not divine ones. Accordingly, the man who went and gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day was punished with death. For it was his own work which he did; and this<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4606_1479783" id="P4606_1479783" name="P4606_1479783">271</a></sup> the law forbade.

What must the Creator do, in order to escape the censure of the Marcionites? Must He prematurely condemn men, who are thus far correct in their conduct, because of future delinquencies? But it is not the mark of a good God to condemn beforehand persons who have not yet deserved condemnation. Must He then refuse to eject sinners, on account of their previous good deeds? But it is not the characteristic of a just judge to forgive sins in consideration of former virtues which are no longer practised.

For there occurs even in good works a confession of repentance, as a reproach and condemnation of the man who has proved himself unthankful for a benefit. For instance, in this case of Saul, the Creator, who had made no mistake in selecting him for the kingdom, and endowing him with His Holy Spirit, makes a statement respecting the goodliness of his person, how that He had most fitly chosen him as being at that moment the choicest man, so that (as He says) there was not his fellow among the children of Israel.<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4644_1487046" id="P4644_1487046" name="P4644_1487046">300</a></sup> Neither was He ignorant how he would afterwards turn out. For no one would bear you out in imputing lack of foresight to that God whom, since you do not deny Him to be divine, you allow to be also foreseeing; for this proper attribute of divinity exists in Him. However, He did, as I have said, burden<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4645_1487369" id="P4645_1487369" name="P4645_1487369">301</a></sup> the guilt of Saul with the confession of His own repentance; but as there is an absence of all error and wrong in His choice of Saul, it follows that this repentance is to be understood as upbraiding another<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4646_1487594" id="P4646_1487594" name="P4646_1487594">302</a></sup> rather than as self-incriminating.<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4647_1487648" id="P4647_1487648" name="P4647_1487648">303</a></sup> Look here then, say you: I discover a self-incriminating case in the matter of the Ninevites, when the book of Jonah declares, "And God repented of the evil that He had said that He would do unto them; and He did it not."<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4648_1487889" id="P4648_1487889" name="P4648_1487889">304</a></sup> In accordance with which Jonah himself says unto the Lord, "Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest Thee of the evil."<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4649_1488135" id="P4649_1488135" name="P4649_1488135">305</a></sup> It is well, therefore, that he premised the attribute<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4650_1488209" id="P4650_1488209" name="P4650_1488209">306</a></sup> of the most good God as most patient over the wicked, and most abundant in mercy and kindness over such as acknowledged and bewailed their sins, as the Ninevites were then doing.

And because Marcion, too, maintains that a good tree ought not to produce bad fruit; but yet he has mentioned "evil" (in the passage under discussion), which the most good God is incapable of,<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4652_1488834" id="P4652_1488834" name="P4652_1488834">308</a></sup> is there forthcoming any explanation of these "evils," which may render them compatible with even the most Good?

Therefore, if the Creator repented of such evil as this, as showing that the creature deserve decondemnation, and ought to be punished for his sin, then, in<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4661_1490383" id="P4661_1490383" name="P4661_1490383">317</a></sup> the present instance no fault of a criminating nature will be imputed to the Creator, for having deservedly and worthily decreed the destruction of a city so full of iniquity. What therefore He had justly decreed, having no evil purpose in His decree, He decreed from the principle of justice,<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4662_1490695" id="P4662_1490695" name="P4662_1490695">318</a></sup> not from malevolence. Yet He gave it the name of "evil," because of the evil and desert involved in the very suffering itself. Then, you will say, if you excuse the evil under name of justice, on the ground that He had justly determined destruction against the people of Nineveh, He must even on this argument be blameworthy, for having repented of an act of justice, which surely should not be repented of. Certainly not,<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4663_1491170" id="P4663_1491170" name="P4663_1491170">319</a></sup> my reply is; God will never repent of an act of justice. And it now remains that we should understand what God's repentance means. For although man repents most frequently on the recollection of a sin, and occasionally even from the unpleasantness<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4664_1491431" id="P4664_1491431" name="P4664_1491431">320</a></sup> of some good action, this is never the case with God. For, inasmuch as God neither commits sin nor condemns a good action, in so far is there no room in Him for repentance of either a good or an evil deed. Now this point is determined for you even in the scripture which we have quoted. Samuel says to Saul, "The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4665_1491888" id="P4665_1491888" name="P4665_1491888">321</a></sup> and into two parts shall Israel be divided: "for He will not turn Himself, nor repent; for He does not repent as a man does."<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4666_1492036" id="P4666_1492036" name="P4666_1492036">322</a></sup> According, therefore, to this definition, the divine repentance takes in all cases a different form from that of man, in that it is never regarded as the result of improvidence or of fickleness, or of any condemnation of a good or an evil work. What, then, will be the mode of God's repentance? It is already quite clear,<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4667_1492396" id="P4667_1492396" name="P4667_1492396">323</a></sup> if you avoid referring it to human conditions. For it will have no other meaning than a simple change of a prior purpose; and this is admissible without any blame even in a man, much more<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4668_1492600" id="P4668_1492600" name="P4668_1492600">324</a></sup> in God, whose every purpose is faultless. Now in Greek the word for repentance (<font face="SPIonic">meta/noia</font>) is formed, not from the confession of a sin, but from a change of mind, which in God we have shown to be regulated by the occurrence of varying circumstances.</p>

Cain, however, He not only cursed; but when he wished to atone for his sin by death, He even prohibited his dying, so that he had to bear the load of this prohibition in addition to his crime. This, then, will prove to be the ignorance of our God, which was simulated on this account, that delinquent man should not be unaware of what he ought to do. Coming down to the case of Sodom and Gomorrha, he says: "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me; and if not, I will know."<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4690_1497214" id="P4690_1497214" name="P4690_1497214">343</a></sup> Well, was He in this instance also uncertain through ignorance, and desiring to know? Or was this a necessary tone of utterance, as expressive of a minatory and not a dubious sense, under the colour of an inquiry? If you make merry at God's "going down," as if He could not except by the descent have accomplished His judgment, take care that you do not strike your own God with as hard a blow. For He also came down to accomplish what He wished.</p>

But it is not possible for him to appear to have sworn falsely, when he was ignorant, as you say he was, that there was another God. For when he swore by that which he knew, he really committed no perjury. But it was not a vain oath for him to swear that there was no other God. It would indeed be a vain oath, if there had been no persons who believed that there were other Gods, like the worshippers of idols then, and the heretics of the present day. Therefore He swears by Himself, in order that you may believe God, even when He swears that there is besides Himself no other God at all. But you have yourself, O Marcion, compelled God to do this. For even so early as then were you foreseen. Hence, if He swears both in His promises and His threatenings, and thus extorts<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4697_1499038" id="P4697_1499038" name="P4697_1499038">347</a></sup> faith which at first was difficult, nothing is unworthy of God which causes men to believe in God. But (you say) God was even then mean<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4698_1499193" id="P4698_1499193" name="P4698_1499193">348</a></sup> enough in His very fierceness, when, in His wrath against the people for their consecration of the calf, He makes this request of His servant Moses: "Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of thee a great nation."<sup><a href="footnote/fn46.htm#P4699_1499484" id="P4699_1499484" name="P4699_1499484">349</a></sup> Accordingly, you maintain that Moses is better than his God, as the deprecator, nay the averter, of His anger.

It is enough, however, that the nation was at the instant really given to Moses. That which he, as a servant, was able to ask of the Lord, the Lord required of Himself. For this purpose did He say to His servant, "Let me alone, that I may consume them," in order that by his entreaty, and by offering himself, he might hinder<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4701_1500291" id="P4701_1500291" name="P4701_1500291">351</a></sup> (the threatened judgment), and that you might by such an Instance learn how much privilege is vouchsafed<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4702_1500416" id="P4702_1500416" name="P4702_1500416">352</a></sup> with God to a faithful man and a prophet.</p>

If I were arguing with heathens, I should dwell more at length on this point; although with heretics too the discussion does not stand on very different grounds. Inasmuch as ye yourselves have now come to the belief that God moved about<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4710_1501759" id="P4710_1501759" name="P4710_1501759">357</a></sup> in the form and all other circumstances of man's nature,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4711_1501835" id="P4711_1501835" name="P4711_1501835">358</a></sup> you will of course no longer require to be convinced that God conformed Himself to humanity, but feel yourselves bound by your own faith. For if the God (in whom ye believe, ) even from His higher condition, prostrated the supreme dignity of His majesty to such a lowliness as to undergo death, even the death of the cross, why can you not suppose that some humiliations<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4712_1502226" id="P4712_1502226" name="P4712_1502226">359</a></sup> are becoming to our God also, only more tolerable than Jewish contumelies, and crosses,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4713_1502335" id="P4713_1502335" name="P4713_1502335">360</a></sup> and sepulchres?

With regard, however, to the Father, the very gospel which is common to us will testify that He was never visible, according to the word of Christ: "No man knoweth the Father, save the Son."<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4725_1505662" id="P4725_1505662" name="P4725_1505662">372</a></sup> For even in the Old Testament He had declared, "No man shall see me, and live."<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4726_1505763" id="P4726_1505763" name="P4726_1505763">373</a></sup> He means that the Father is invisible, in whose authority and in whose name was He God who appeared as the Son of God.

Whatever attributes therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found in the Father, who is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as unworthy must be supposed to be in the Son, who has been seen, and heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant of the Father, uniting in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man, in order that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your esteem is the entire disgrace of my God, Is in fact the sacrament of man's salvation God held converse with man, that man might learn to act as God. God dealt on equal terms<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4728_1506823" id="P4728_1506823" name="P4728_1506823">375</a></sup> with man, that man might be able to deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you <i>ex fide</i> believe that God was crucified. How great, then, is your perversity in respect of the two characters of the Creator! You designate Him as <i>Judge</i>, and reprobate as Cruelty that severity of the Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require God to be <i>very good</i>, and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of His which accorded with His kindness, (and) held lowly converse in proportion to the mediocrity of man's estate. He pleases you not, whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What if the same features should be discovered in your God? That <i>He</i> too is a judge, we have already shown in the proper section:<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4729_1507689" id="P4729_1507689" name="P4729_1507689">376</a></sup> that from being a judge He must needs be severe; and from being severe He must also be cruel, if indeed cruel.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4730_1507853" id="P4730_1507853" name="P4730_1507853">377</a></sup> </p>

</ul><p>Now, touching the weaknesses and malignities, and the other (alleged), notes (of the Creator), I too shall advance <i>antitheses</i> in rivalry to Marcion's. If my God knew not of any other superior to Himself, your god also was utterly unaware that there was any beneath himself. It is just what Heraclitus "the obscure"<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4734_1508271" id="P4734_1508271" name="P4734_1508271">378</a></sup> said; whether it be up or down,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4735_1508443" id="P4735_1508443" name="P4735_1508443">379</a></sup> it comes to the same thing. If, indeed, he was not ignorant (of his position), it must have occurred to Him from the beginning. Sin and death, and the author of sin too-the devil-and all the evil which my God permitted to be, this also, did your god permit; for he allowed Him to permit it. Our God changed His purposes;<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4736_1509081" id="P4736_1509081" name="P4736_1509081">380</a></sup> in like manner yours did also. For he who cast his look so late in the human race, changed that purpose, which for so long a period had refused to cast that look. Our God repented Him of the evil in a given case; so also did yours. For by the fact that he at last had regard to the salvation of man, he showed such a repentance of his previous disregard<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4737_1509454" id="P4737_1509454" name="P4737_1509454">381</a></sup> as was due for a wrong deed. But neglect of man's salvation will be accounted a wrong deed, simply because it has been remedied<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4738_1509606" id="P4738_1509606" name="P4738_1509606">382</a></sup> by his repentance in the conduct of your god. Our God you say commanded a fraudulent act, but in a matter of gold and silver. Now, inasmuch as man is more precious than gold and silver, in so far is your god more fraudulent still, because he robs man of his Lord and Creator. Eye for eye does our God require; but your god does even a greater injury, (in your ideas, ) when he prevents an act of retaliation. For what man will not return a blow, without waiting to be struck a second time.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4739_1510122" id="P4739_1510122" name="P4739_1510122">383</a></sup> Our God (you say) knows not whom He ought to choose. Nor does your god, for if he had foreknown the issue, he would not have chosen the traitor Judas. If you allege that the Creator practised deception<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4740_1510349" id="P4740_1510349" name="P4740_1510349">384</a></sup> in any instance, there was a far greater mendacity in your Christ, whose very body was unreal.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4741_1510461" id="P4741_1510461" name="P4741_1510461">385</a></sup> Many were consumed by the severity of my God. Those also who were not saved by your god are verily disposed by him to ruin. My God ordered a man to be slain. Your god willed himself to be put to death; not less a homicide against himself than in respect of him by whom he meant to be slain. I will moreover prove to Marcion that they were many who were slain by his god; for he made every one a homicide: in other words, he doomed him to perish, except when people failed in no duty towards Christ.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4742_1511018" id="P4742_1511018" name="P4742_1511018">386</a></sup> But the straightforward virtue of truth is contented with few resources.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4743_1511153" id="P4743_1511153" name="P4743_1511153">387</a></sup> Many things will be necessary for falsehood.</p>

</ul><p>But I would have attacked Marcion's own <i>Antitheses</i> in closer and fuller combat, if a more elaborate demolition of them were required in maintaining for the Creator the character of a good God and a Judge, after<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4747_1511581" id="P4747_1511581" name="P4747_1511581">388</a></sup> the examples of both points, which we have shown to be so worthy of God. Since, however, these two attributes of goodness and justice do together make up the proper fulness of the Divine Being as omnipotent, I am able to content myself with having now compendiously refuted his <i>Antitheses</i>, which aim at drawing distinctions out of the qualities of the (Creator's) artifices,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4748_1511973" id="P4748_1511973" name="P4748_1511973">389</a></sup> or of His laws, or of His great works; and thus sundering Christ from the Creator, as the most Good from the Judge, as One who is merciful from Him who is ruthless, and One who brings salvation from Him who causes ruin. The truth is,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4749_1512226" id="P4749_1512226" name="P4749_1512226">390</a></sup> they<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4750_1512244" id="P4750_1512244" name="P4750_1512244">391</a></sup> rather unite the two Beings whom they arrange in those diversities (of attribute), which yet are compatible in God. For only take away the title of Marcion's book,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4751_1512443" id="P4751_1512443" name="P4751_1512443">392</a></sup> and the intention and purpose of the work itself, and you could get no better demonstration that the self-same God was both very good and a Judge, inasmuch as these two characters are only competently found in God. Indeed, the very effort which is made in the selected examples to oppose Christ to the Creator, conduces all the more to their union. For so entirely one and the same was the nature of the Divine Beings, the good and the severe, as shown both by the same examples and in similar proofs, that It willed to display Its goodness to those on whom It had first inflicted Its severity. The difference in time was no matter of surprise, when the same God was afterwards merciful in presence of evils which had been subdued,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4752_1513454" id="P4752_1513454" name="P4752_1513454">393</a></sup> who had once been so austere whilst they were as yet unsubdued. Thus, by help of the <i>Antitheses</i>, the dispensation of the Creator can be more readily shown to have been <i>reformed</i> by Christ, rather than <i>destroyed; </i><sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4753_1513772" id="P4753_1513772" name="P4753_1513772">394</a></sup> <i>restored</i>, rather than <i>abolished</i>;<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4754_1513844" id="P4754_1513844" name="P4754_1513844">395</a></sup> especially as you sever your own god from everything like acrimonious conduct,<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4755_1513940" id="P4755_1513940" name="P4755_1513940">396</a></sup> even from all rivalry whatsoever with the Creator. Now, since this is the case, how comes it to pass that the <i>Antitheses</i> demonstrate Him to have been the Creator's rival in every disputed cause?<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4756_1514165" id="P4756_1514165" name="P4756_1514165">397</a></sup> Well, even here, too, I will allow that in these causes my God has been a jealous God, who has in His own right taken especial care that all things done by Him should be in their beginning of a robuster growth;<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4757_1514413" id="P4757_1514413" name="P4757_1514413">398</a></sup> and this in the way of a good, because rational<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4758_1514631" id="P4758_1514631" name="P4758_1514631">399</a></sup> emulation, which tends to maturity. In this sense the world itself will acknowledge His "antitheses," from the contrariety of its own elements, although it has been regulated with the very highest reason.<sup><a href="footnote/fn47.htm#P4759_1515028" id="P4759_1515028" name="P4759_1515028">400</a></sup> Wherefore, most thoughtless Marcion, it was your duty to have shown that one (of the two Gods you teach) was a God of light, and the other a God of darkness; and then you would have found it an easier task to persuade us that one was a God of goodness, the other a God of severity. How ever, the "antithesis" (or variety of administration) will rightly be His property, to whom it actually belongs in (the government of) the world. </p>
