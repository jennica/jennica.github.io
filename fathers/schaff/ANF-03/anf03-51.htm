</ul><p>The Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God-Word of Reason, and Reason and Spirit of Word-Jesus Christ our Lord, namely, who is both the one and the other,<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11766_3301913" id="P11766_3301913" name="P11766_3301913">2</a></sup> -has determined for us, the disciples of the New Testament, a new form of prayer; for in this particular also it was needful that new wine should be laid up in new skins, and a new breadth be sewn to a new garment.<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11767_3302254" id="P11767_3302254" name="P11767_3302254">3</a></sup> Besides, whatever had been in bygone days, has either been quite changed, as circumcision; or else supplemented, as the rest of the Law; or else fulfilled, as Prophecy; or else perfected, as faith itself. For the new grace of God has renewed all things from carnal unto spiritual, by superinducing the Gospel, the obliterator of the whole ancient bygone system; in which our Lord Jesus Christ has been approved as the Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God: the Spirit, by which He was mighty; the Word, by which He taught; the Reason, by which He came.<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11768_3302881" id="P11768_3302881" name="P11768_3302881">4</a></sup> So the prayer composed by Christ has been composed of three parts. In speech,<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11769_3303037" id="P11769_3303037" name="P11769_3303037">5</a></sup> by which <i>prayer</i> is enunciated, in spirit, by which alone it prevails, even John had taught his disciples to pray,<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11770_3303163" id="P11770_3303163" name="P11770_3303163">6</a></sup> but all John's doings were laid as groundwork for Christ, until, when "He had increased "-just as the same John used to fore-announce "that it was needful" that "He should increase and himself decrease"<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11771_3303945" id="P11771_3303945" name="P11771_3303945">7</a></sup> -the whole work of the forerunner passed over, together with his spirit itself, unto the Lord. Therefore, after what form of words John taught to pray is not extant, because earthly things have given place to heavenly. "He who is from the earth," says John, "speaketh earthly things; and He who is here from the heavens speaketh those things which He hath seen."<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11772_3304325" id="P11772_3304325" name="P11772_3304325">8</a></sup> And what is the Lord Christ's-as this method of praying is-<i>that</i> is <i>not</i> heavenly? And so, blessed <i>brethren</i>, let us consider His heavenly wisdom: first, touching the precept of praying secretly, whereby He exacted man's faith, that he should be confident that the sight and hearing of Almighty God are present beneath roofs, and extend even into the secret place; and required modesty in faith, that it should offer its religious homage to Him alone, whom it believed to see and to hear everywhere. Further, since wisdom succeeded in the following precept, let it in like manner appertain unto faith, and the modesty of faith, that we think not that the Lord must be approached with a train of words, who, we are certain, takes unsolicited foresight for His own. And yet that very brevity-and let this make for the third grade of wisdom-is supported on the substance of a great and blessed interpretation, and is as diffuse in meaning as it is compressed in words. For it has embraced not only the special duties of prayer, be it veneration of God or petition for man, but almost every discourse of the Lord, every record of <i>His</i> Discipline; so that, in fact, in the Prayer is comprised an epitome of the whole Gospel. </p>

<font size="3">Chapter II.-The First Clause.</font></p>
</ul><p>The prayer begins with a testimony to God, and with the reward of faith, when we say, "Our Father who art in the heavens; "for (in so saying), we at once pray to God, and commend faith, whose reward this appellation is. It is written, "To them who believed on Him He gave power to be called sons of God."<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11776_3305897" id="P11776_3305897" name="P11776_3305897">9</a></sup> However, our Lord very frequently proclaimed God as a Father to us; nay, even gave a precept "that we call no one on earth father, but the Father whom we have in the heavens:<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11777_3306088" id="P11777_3306088" name="P11777_3306088">10</a></sup> and so, in thus praying, we are likewise obeying the precept. Happy they who recognize their Father! This is the reproach that is brought against Israel, to which the Spirit attests heaven and earth, saying, "I have begotten sons, and they have not recognized me."<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11778_3306374" id="P11778_3306374" name="P11778_3306374">11</a></sup> Moreover, in saying "Father," we also call Him "God." That appellation is one both of filial duty and of power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked; "for I," saith He, "and the Father are One."<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11779_3306588" id="P11779_3306588" name="P11779_3306588">12</a></sup> Nor is even our mother the Church passed by, if, that is, in the Father and the Son is recognized the mother, from whom arises the name both of Father and of Son. In one general term, then, or word, we both honour God, together with His own,<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11780_3306847" id="P11780_3306847" name="P11780_3306847">13</a></sup> and are mindful of the precept, and set a mark on such as have forgotten their Father.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P11782_3306997"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter III.-The Second Clause.</font></p>
</ul><p>The name of "God the Father" had been published to none. Even Moses, who had interrogated Him on that very point, had heard a different name.<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11784_3307171" id="P11784_3307171" name="P11784_3307171">14</a></sup> To us it has been revealed in the Son, for the Son is now the Father's new name. "I am come," saith He, "in the Father's name; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11785_3307321" id="P11785_3307321" name="P11785_3307321">15</a></sup> and again, "Father, glorify Thy name; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11786_3307378" id="P11786_3307378" name="P11786_3307378">16</a></sup> and more openly, "I have manifested Thy name to men."<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11787_3307451" id="P11787_3307451" name="P11787_3307451">17</a></sup> That <i>name</i>, therefore, we pray may "be hallowed." Not that it is becoming for men to <i>wish</i> God <i>well</i>, as if there were any other<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11788_3307596" id="P11788_3307596" name="P11788_3307596">18</a></sup> by whom He may be wished well, or as if He would suffer unless we do so wish. Plainly, it is universally becoming for God to be <i>blessed</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11789_3307760" id="P11789_3307760" name="P11789_3307760">19</a></sup> in every place and time, on account of the memory of His benefits ever due from every man. But this petition also serves the turn of a blessing. Otherwise, when is the name of God not "holy," and "hallowed" through Himself, seeing that of Himself He sanctifies all others-He to whom that surrounding circle of angels cease not to say, "Holy, holy, holy? "<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11790_3308135" id="P11790_3308135" name="P11790_3308135">20</a></sup> In like wise, therefore, we too, candidates for angelhood, if we succeed in deserving it, begin even here on earth to learn by heart that strain hereafter to be raised unto God, and the function of future glory. So far, for the glory of God. On the other hand, for our own petition, when we say, "Hallowed be Thy name," we pray this; that it may be hallowed <i>in us</i> who are in Him, as well in all others for whom the grace of God is still waiting;<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11791_3308610" id="P11791_3308610" name="P11791_3308610">21</a></sup> that we may obey this precept, too, in "praying for all,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11792_3308687" id="P11792_3308687" name="P11792_3308687">22</a></sup> even for our personal enemies.<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11793_3308737" id="P11793_3308737" name="P11793_3308737">23</a></sup> And therefore with suspended utterance, not saying, "Hallowed be it <i>in us</i>, "we say,-"<i>in all</i>."</p>
<ul><p><a name="P11795_3308847"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter IV.-The Third Clause.</font></p>
</ul><p>According to this model,<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11797_3308902" id="P11797_3308902" name="P11797_3308902">24</a></sup> we subjoin, "Thy will be done in the heavens and on the earth; "<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11798_3309165" id="P11798_3309165" name="P11798_3309165">25</a></sup> not that there is some power withstanding<sup><a href="footnote/fn117.htm#P11799_3309369" id="P11799_3309369" name="P11799_3309369">26</a></sup> to prevent God's will being done, and we pray for Him the successful achievement of His will; but we pray for His will to be done <i>in all</i>. For, by figurative interpretation of <i>flesh</i> and <i>spirit, we</i> are "heaven" and "earth; "albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the petition is the same, that <i>in us</i> God's will be done on earth, to make it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the heavens. What, moreover, <i>does</i> God will, but that we should walk according to His Discipline? We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance of His will, and the capacity to do it, that we may be saved both in the heavens and on earth; because the sum of His will is the salvation of them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that will of God which the Lord accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself proclaimed that He did not His own, but the Father's will, without doubt those things which He used to do <i>were</i> the Father's will;<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11800_3310369" id="P11800_3310369" name="P11800_3310369">27</a></sup> unto which things, as unto exemplars, we are now provoked;<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11801_3310445" id="P11801_3310445" name="P11801_3310445">28</a></sup> to preach, to work, to endure even unto death. And we <i>need</i> the will of God, that we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, "Thy will be done," we are even wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is nothing of <i>evil</i> in the will of God; even if, proportionably to each one's deserts, somewhat other<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11802_3310832" id="P11802_3310832" name="P11802_3310832">29</a></sup> is imposed on us. So by this expression we premonish our own selves unto patience. The Lord also, when He had wished to demonstrate to us, even in His own flesh, the flesh's infirmity, by the reality of suffering, said, "Father, remove this Thy cup; "and remembering Himself, <i>added</i>, "save that not my will, but Thine be done."<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11803_3311208" id="P11803_3311208" name="P11803_3311208">30</a></sup> Himself <i>was</i> the Will and the Power of the Father: and yet, for the demonstration of the patience which was due, He gave Himself up <i>to</i> the Father's Will.</p>
<ul><p><a name="P11805_3311379"></a>
<font size="3">Chapter V.-The Fourth Clause.</font></p>
</ul><p>"Thy kingdom come" has also reference to that whereto "Thy will be done" refers-<i>in us</i>, that is. For when does God not reign, in whose hand is the heart of all kings?<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11807_3311575" id="P11807_3311575" name="P11807_3311575">31</a></sup> But whatever we wish for ourselves we augur for Him, and <i>to</i> Him we attribute what <i>from</i> Him we expect. And so, if the <i>manifestation</i> of the Lord's kingdom pertains unto the will of God and unto our anxious expectation, how do some pray for some protraction of the age,<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11808_3311861" id="P11808_3311861" name="P11808_3311861">32</a></sup> when the kingdom of God, which we pray may arrive, tends unto the consummation of the age?<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11809_3311979" id="P11809_3311979" name="P11809_3311979">33</a></sup> Our wish is, that our reign be hastened, not our servitude protracted. Even if it had not been prescribed in the Prayer that we should ask for the advent of the kingdom, we should, unbidden, have sent forth that cry, hastening toward the realization of our hope. The souls of the martyrs beneath the altar<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11810_3312497" id="P11810_3312497" name="P11810_3312497">34</a></sup> cry in jealousy unto the Lord "How long, Lord, dost Thou not avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?

</ul><p>But how gracefully has the Divine Wisdom arranged the order of the prayer; so that <i>after</i> things heavenly-that is, after the "Name" of God, the "Will" of God, and the "Kingdom" of God-it should give earthly necessities also room for a petition! For the Lord had<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11817_3313282" id="P11817_3313282" name="P11817_3313282">38</a></sup> withal issued His edict, "Seek ye first the kingdom, and then even these shall be added: "<sup><a href="footnote/fn118.htm#P11818_3313708" id="P11818_3313708" name="P11818_3313708">39</a></sup> albeit we may rather understand, "Give us this day our daily bread," <i>spiritually</i>.

What kind of sacrifice is that from which men depart without peace? Whatever our prayer be, it will not be better than the observance of the precept by which we are bidden to conceal our fasts;<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11924_3331396" id="P11924_3331396" name="P11924_3331396">106</a></sup> for <i>now</i>, by abstinence from the kiss, we are known to be fasting. But even if there be some reason <i>for this practice</i>, still, lest you offend against this precept, you may perhaps defer your "peace" <i>at home</i>, where it is not possible for your fast to be entirely kept secret. But wherever else you can conceal your observance, you ought to remember the precept: thus you may satisfy the requirements of Discipline abroad and of custom at home. So, too, on the day of the passover,<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11925_3331900" id="P11925_3331900" name="P11925_3331900">107</a></sup> when the religious observance of a fast is general, and as it were public, we justly forego the kiss, caring nothing to conceal anything which we do in common with all.</p>

<font size="3">Chapter XXI.-Of Virgins.</font></p>
</ul><p>But that point which is promiscuously observed throughout the churches, whether virgins ought to be veiled or no, must be treated of. For they who allow to virgins immunity from head-covering, appear to rest on this; that the apostle has not defined "virgins" by name, but "women,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11941_3334244" id="P11941_3334244" name="P11941_3334244">114</a></sup> as "to be veiled; "nor the sex generally, so as to say "females," but a class of the sex, by saying "women: "for if he had named the sex by saying "females," he would have made his limit absolute for every woman; but while he names one class of the sex, he separates another class by being silent.

Here they find it to be the <i>name of the sex</i>, not a <i>class of the sex</i>: if, that is, God gave to Eve, when she had not yet known a man, the surname "woman" and "female"<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11946_3335110" id="P11946_3335110" name="P11946_3335110">116</a></sup> -("female," whereby the sex generally; "woman," hereby a class of the sex, is marked).<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11947_3335285" id="P11947_3335285" name="P11947_3335285">117</a></sup> So, since at that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word "woman," that word has been made common even to a virgin.<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11948_3335569" id="P11948_3335569" name="P11948_3335569">118</a></sup> Nor is it wonderful that the apostle-guided, of course, by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn up-has used the selfsame word in writing "women," which, by the example of Eve unwedded, is applicable too to a "virgin." In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For even by this very fact, that he has not <i>named</i> "virgins" (as he does in another place<sup><a href="footnote/fn119.htm#P11949_3336175" id="P11949_3336175" name="P11949_3336175">119</a></sup> where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching <i>every</i> woman, and touching <i>the whole</i> sex; and that there is no distinction made between a "virgin" <i>and any other</i>, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere-namely, where the difference requires-remembers to make the distinction, (moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names, ) wishes, where he makes <i>no</i> distinction (while he does not name each), <i>no</i> difference to be understood. What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual to say, "women" rather than "females; "that is, <font face="SPIonic">gunai=kaj</font> (<font face="Semitica Dict">gunaikas</font>) rather than <font face="SPIonic">qhlei/aj</font> (<font face="Semitica Dict">theleias</font>)?

The first infusion of the Holy Spirit into the congregated disciples took place at "the third hour."<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12005_3348643" id="P12005_3348643" name="P12005_3348643">166</a></sup> Peter, on the day on which he experienced the vision of Universal Community,<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12006_3348749" id="P12006_3348749" name="P12006_3348749">167</a></sup> (exhibited) in that small vessel,<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12007_3348926" id="P12007_3348926" name="P12007_3348926">168</a></sup> had ascended into the more lofty parts <i>of the house</i>, for prayer's sake "at the sixth hour."<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12008_3349182" id="P12008_3349182" name="P12008_3349182">169</a></sup> The same (apostle) was going into the temple, with John, at the ninth <i>hour</i>,"<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12009_3349277" id="P12009_3349277" name="P12009_3349277">170</a></sup> when he restored the paralytic to his health. Albeit these <i>practices</i> stand simply without any <i>precept</i> for their observance, still it may be granted a good thing to establish some definite presumption, which may both add stringency to the admonition to, pray, and may, as it were by a law, tear us out from our businesses unto such a duty; so that-what we read to have been observed by Daniel also,<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12010_3349780" id="P12010_3349780" name="P12010_3349780">171</a></sup> in accordance (of course) with Israel's discipline-we pray at least not less than thrice in the day, debtors as we are to Three-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: of course, in addition to our regular prayers which are due, without any admonition, on the entrance of light and of night. But, withal, it becomes believers not to take food, and not to go to the bath, before interposing a prayer; for the refreshments and nourishments of the spirit are to be held prior to those of the flesh, and things heavenly prior to things earthly.</p>

But how far more amply operative is <i>Christian</i> prayer! It does not station the angel of dew in mid-fires,<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12041_3353854" id="P12041_3353854" name="P12041_3353854">190</a></sup> nor muzzle lions, nor transfer to the hungry the rustics' bread;<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12042_3354104" id="P12042_3354104" name="P12042_3354104">191</a></sup> it has no delegated grace to avert any sense of suffering;<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12043_3354190" id="P12043_3354190" name="P12043_3354190">192</a></sup> but it supplies the suffering, and the feeling, and the grieving, with endurance: it amplifies grace by virtue, that faith may know what she obtains from the Lord, understanding what-for God's name's sake-she suffers.

Now, however, the prayer of righteousness avers all God's anger, keeps bivouac on behalf of personal enemies, makes supplication on behalf of persecutors. Is it wonder if <i>it</i> knows how to extort the <i>rains</i> of heaven<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12045_3354882" id="P12045_3354882" name="P12045_3354882">194</a></sup> -(prayer) which was <i>once</i> able to procure its <i>fires</i>?<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12046_3354968" id="P12046_3354968" name="P12046_3354968">195</a></sup> Prayer is alone that which vanquishes<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12047_3355028" id="P12047_3355028" name="P12047_3355028">196</a></sup> God. But Christ has willed that it be operative for no evil: He had conferred on it all its virtue in the cause of good. And so it knows nothing save how to recall the souls of the departed from the very path of death, to transform the weak, to restore the sick, to purge the possessed, to open prison-bars, to loose the bonds of the innocent. Likewise it washes away faults, repels temptations, extinguishes persecutions, consoles the faint-spirited, cheers the high-spirited, escorts travellers, appeases waves, makes robbers stand aghast, nourishes the poor, governs the rich, upraises the fallen, arrests the falling, confirms the standing. Prayer is the wall of faith: her arms and missiles<sup><a href="footnote/fn120.htm#P12048_3355800" id="P12048_3355800" name="P12048_3355800">197</a></sup> against the foe who keeps watch over us on all sides. And, so never walk we unarmed. By day, be we mindful of Station; by night, of vigil.
